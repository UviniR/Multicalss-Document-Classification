CSAM crimes are varied and subject to 
change, terminology differs across researchers 
and practitioners, and inconsistent ways of 
operationalising and measuring CSAM make 
comparison across studies difficult. This has had a 
negative impact on global efforts at data collection 
across different forms of child sexual abuse and 
exploitation and is the case with online CSAM.
Our capacity to evaluate the scale of the problem in 
terms of the quantity of CSAM is compromised by 
the volume of online content in the open, and also 
hidden, Internet and the reality that content may be 
removed but not destroyed.
Criminal justice data from public records, as well 
as research surveys, would suggest an increase 
over time in the number of CSAM crimes. 
Youth-produced images pose a problem for law 
enforcement in terms of resource demands 
alongside their ability to determine the age of the 
child and whether they have been produced as part 
of coercive activity by adults or peers or represent 
behaviour that is consistent with adolescent 
development and risk-taking. 
Mapping of existing national and international CSAM 
databases would suggest that they fall largely into 
two groups: hash collections and image collections. 
While there are a number of databases globally, there is limited connectivity between them. 
Differences in how data is defined and recorded 
means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions 
as to whether there have been changes in the 
gender, age and level of violence within recorded 
CSAM. However there is some converging evidence 
that the percentage of egregious images has 
increased over time. 
Across three studies, younger victims are associated 
with greater levels of sexual violence, produced 
within a family context and more likely to be widely 
distributed. However, the preponderance of images 
are of pubescent and pre-pubescent children and 
the numbers of images of very young children 
(infants and toddlers) remain relatively low. This is in 
contrast to the views of experts interviewed in the 
current study.
The majority of victims and offenders are white 
Caucasians, and while there has been an increase 
in other ethnic groups, these numbers remain 
disproportionately small. This does require further 
investigation given the increasing availability of 
Internet connectivity through hand-held devices 
across hand-held devices and the concerns 
expressed about, for example, live streaming of 
abuse. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL6Definitions of what constitutes online-facilitated 
child sexual abuse and exploitation are both varied 
and subject to change, and as noted by a recent 
study,1 the terms used in research are often different 
from those used for legally defined crimes, which 
also differ between, and on occasions within, 
countries. Differing terminology makes comparison 
across studies difficult, and this is reflected in the 
decision by ECPAT International to work with other 
stakeholders to develop terminology guidelines, 
as absence of consensus about the terms used 
has had a negative impact on global efforts at data 
collection across different forms of child sexual 
abuse and exploitation.2 These forms may include: 
the production, dissemination and possession of 
child sexual abuse material (CSAM: which are known 
in many jurisdictions as ‘child pornography’); online 
grooming or active sexual solicitation of children; 
sexting; sexual extortion of children (also known 
as ‘sextortion’); revenge pornography; exploitation 
of children through online prostitution, and live 
streaming of sexual abuse.3 We can also make a 
distinction between cyber-enabled and cyber-
dependent crime: for example CSAM would fall into 
the first category, whereas live streaming of sexual 
abuse would be in the latter as it is only possible 
because of the technology.4 It would be true to 
say that online-facilitated child sexual abuse and 
exploitation has been seen as both a public health 
and criminal justice problem.5 There is a perception 
that with each new technological advancement, law 
enforcement, researchers, and advocates

8 Crimes Against Children Research Center, accessed 18 December 2018, http://www.unh.edu/ccrc/. find themselves out-paced as they combat ever-
changing and ever-growing problems. Due to the 
multi-faceted nature of online-facilitated child 
sexual abuse and exploitation, there are significant 
gaps in the way these crimes are understood. In 
her December 2014 report to the Human Rights 
Council, the Special Rapporteur on the sale and 
sexual exploitation of children called on States 
to “conduct research […] in order to obtain a 
comprehensive picture of the phenomena […]” and 
to “establish a reliable and standard information on 
the phenomena”.6 The same month, taking place in 
London, the #WePROTECT Children Online Global 
Summit that was convened by the government 
of the United Kingdom clearly highlighted the 
need for development of indicators and further 
collection of data.7 Global indicators and standards 
in data collection would provide clear language 
and metrics for law enforcement, researchers, and 
advocates to communicate more effectively about 
the phenomena. Currently, there is a growing 
body of data which show evidence of emerging 
trends in several key areas of online-facilitated 
child sexual abuse and exploitation. However, the 
preponderance of empirical studies has taken place 
within high income countries and, outside of the 
research from the Crimes Against Children Research 
Center,8 there is a paucity of longitudinal data to 
help us understand changing patterns of offending 
and victimisation in this area. To date, bids to 
quantify the scale of online-facilitated child sexual 
abuse and exploitation have counted the number  
 
 1. INTRODUCTIONTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL7of: identified offenders or suspects, as well as 
young people who have engaged in harmful sexual 
behaviour; identified victims; reported offences 
(including public reports as well as crime statistics), 
and the number of confirmed CSAM (images and 
videos). By far the greatest number of publications 
identified in Wagner et al.’s rapid evidence review 
related to self-report victimisation studies.9 
THE AMOUNT OF CHILD  
SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL
The focus of this report is CSAM and questions 
about how much of it exists and whether there are 
changing patterns in the amount of new material 
being identified globally. In absolute terms, we can 
never quantify the amount of material that has 
been created or is in circulation on the Internet, 
because new content is constantly being added and 
only a proportion of older content (some of which 
predates the Internet but has been scanned and 
uploaded) will have been identified and taken down. 
Even with the use of custom-made web crawlers 
to aid notice and takedown of CSAM,10 there is 
no guarantee that it will not be uploaded again. 
However, common metrics to assess CSAM include 
reports from hotlines e.g. the absolute number of 
reported cases analysts have determined to contain 
illegal content over a period of time, and criminal 
justice records (e.g. how many individuals have been 
arrested for possessing CSAM): both methods have 
their limitations. Anecdotally, it is understood that 
material is traded across multiple platforms, and 
that the volume of material outstrips the resources 
available to law enforcement and hotline analysts to 
fully investigate or analyse. So, understandably, the 
number of arrests and reports can never accurately 
represent the actual amount of CSAM in circulation 
at any given time. 
Additionally, parsing out what method or 
terminology to use when measuring the amount 
of identified CSAM is difficult. Material could be 
examined by the number of children victimised in 
a series of images or case, the absolute number of 
images in a collection, or the number of offenders 
responsible for a series of images (either

pubmed/21349830. perpetrating the behaviour, producing the content, 
or distributing the material). An added complication 
is the number of unidentified offenders and victims. 
There are many offenders and images that will 
remain undetected by law enforcement or hotline 
analysts. These offenders are not missed only 
because law enforcement may have limited capacity 
to investigate them, but rather because they may 
use techniques to encrypt or anonymise their 
activities,11 or as with the case of new commercial 
websites, payment is only accepted by digital 
payment systems such as Bitcoin 12 as an emergent 
trend to avoid detection by offenders. 
Other limitations to gauging the amount of CSAM 
from these common metrics are the biases in the 
protocols and laws governing different jurisdictions. 
For example, some countries limit how proactive law 
enforcement agents can be in their investigations, 
requiring them to wait until material is reported 
to their departments before they can begin an 
investigation. Other countries have introduced 
legislation that allows law enforcement and hotline 
analysts to review areas of the Internet that are 
considered popular trading platforms (i.e., forums 
on the dark net). Some evidence has documented 
that the amount of arrests or reports stemming 
from the latter method of investigation has made 
a significant difference in the number of offenders 
detected.13 
PUBLIC REPORTS
Using the number of reports made by the public 
within a given time period to hotlines (a hotline is 
a national online resource that offers members of 
the public to report what they perceive as illegal 
online content) as a metric for the amount of CSAM 
in circulation, would suggest an incremental growth 
in these crimes over the total period that data has 
been collected. However, Donosa (2016) argues for 
caution when interpreting the number of public 
reports as evidence of an increase in the amount 
of CSAM. An increase in reporting may be due to 
other factors, such as an improvement in rates of 
detection because of technological tools, or because 
there has been an increase in human resources  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL8available to manage it. It may also be the case that 
in some countries there is growing awareness of 
the problem and a willingness to report suspected 
CSAM. She concludes that because of the nature of 
the content being dealt with, and the impossibility 
of most hotlines to collect data directly from the 
source, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions: “As 
long as we are unclear how much child sexual 
abuse material is being produced, distributed and 
consumed out there, we will not be able to know for 
sure whether the problem has worsened or not”.14 
There are therefore caveats on how we should 
interpret public reporting of content, not the least 
because in 2015, in addition to receiving reports of 
online CSAM, 85% of hotlines in 2015 also accepted 
other types of reports, which included for example 
racism/hate speech (69%), adult pornography 
(64%), bullying (62%) and self-harm/suicide 
(44%). However, in this global study of hotlines, 
approximately one-third of those surveyed indicated 
that CSAM reports made up the majority of their 
workload.15 The National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children (NCMEC), serves as the United 
States of America’s clearing house for CSAM through 
the CyberTipline. This provides an online mechanism 
for members of the public and electronic service 
providers (ESPs) to report incidents of suspected 
child sexual exploitation. This includes CSAM, 
sexual exploitation of children in travel and tourism, 
online enticement, trafficking of children for sexual 
purposes, child sexual molestation, misleading 
domain names or words, and unsolicited obscene 
material sent to a child. In the report to the United 
States House of Representatives Subcommittee in 
March 2017 it was noted that over recent years, the 
volume of CyberTipline reports received by NCMEC 
had increased from over 1.1 million reports in 2014, 
to more than 4.4 million reports in 2015, to more 
than 8.2 million reports in 2016. By the time of the 
report in 2017, NCMEC had already received over 
2.3 million CyberTipline reports.16 It was suggested

adoption by electronic service providers (ESPs) of 
new technology (such as PhotoDNA17) to enable 
the removal of child exploitation content from their 
platforms. In 2016 it was estimated that 94% of the 
reports submitted to CyberTipline by US-based ESPs 
involved someone outside of the United States. 
In the 2016 Annual Report from the Internet Watch 
Foundation (IWF),18 whose remit is to remove 
CSAM hosted anywhere in the world, including 
non-photographic CSAM hosted in the United 
Kingdom, of the 105,420 reports processed in 2016, 
57,162 were received from public sources with 
the remainder identified through analysts actively 
searching the open Internet using a combination 
of analyst searching and bespoke web crawlers. 
Of these, 57,335 URLs contained CSAM, twenty-
eight per cent of these reports were confirmed 
as containing CSAM.19 INHOPE (a global network 
of hotlines from 49 members whose remit is 
to deal with illegal content online and remove 
CSAM from the Internet),20 reported that they 
received 9,357,240 reports in 2016, with 8,474,713 
confirmed as containing CSAM.21 Cybertip.ca, the 
hotline hosted by the Canadian Centre for Child 
Protection processed 40,251 reports in 2016-17, 
49% of which were forwarded to law enforcement, 
child welfare and (or) INHOPE, or a notice was 
sent to an ESP to report CSAM hosted by a service 
provider in Canada or the United States.22 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE RECORDS
The extent of Internet-mediated sexual abuse 
and exploitation has also been examined through 
police data. The most substantial data set comes 
from the US longitudinal National Juvenile Online 
Victimisation (NJOV) study.23 This arrest study 
collected data in 2000, 2006 and 2009. These 
studies included two phases of data collection:  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL9a postal survey of state, county and local law 
enforcement agencies in the US, of arrests made for  
technology-facilitated sexual crimes against children 
over a specified period of time, and telephone 
interviews concerning cases identified in the 
survey. There was a substantial increase in the 
number of arrests (from 2,577 in 2000 to 7,010 in 
2006 and 8,144 in 2009), although this may not 
indicate an actual increase (as there was an overlap 
in the estimated ranges at the 95% confidence 
interval). Approximately half of the arrests were for 
possession of CSAM (defined as ‘child pornography’ 
in the study). Arrests for crimes where the victim 
was known to the police (through CSAM production) 
increased by approximately 30% between 2000 
and 20006, and doubled between 2006 and 2009. 
This reflected a large increase in offenders who 
were known to their victims and described in the 
study as family and acquaintance offenders. Arrests 
that were made through proactive policing (police 
posing as children online) went down in 2009, 
although arrests for proactive investigation of CSAM 
offences increased in 2009 (2,353 compared to 880 
in 2006).24 The majority of people arrested in each 
wave of the study were male white Caucasians, 
although by 2009 a higher proportion arrests (16%) 
were members of minority ethnic groups. 
The increase in arrests for the production of child 
sexual abuse materials appeared to be largely 
driven by ‘youth-produced sexual images’ which 
were taken by children 17 years or under and 
which met the legal definitions in the US for ‘child 
pornography’. In most of these cases the person 
arrested was an adult who had solicited images 
from a minor. This was also reflected in the fact that 
there were more adolescent victims in 2009 and 
ones where they were face-to-face acquaintances 
with the person arrested. Adult-produced images 
were more likely than the images produced by 
adolescents to be taken by a family member (51% 
as opposed to 6%) who was aged 26 or older, with 
victims younger than 12 years. Adult producers were 
likely to possess additional CSAM which had been 
downloaded from the Internet, and to be discovered 
through law enforcement activity. One quarter 
of the adults producing images distributed them

had produced the images, 83% were distributed, 
mainly by adolescents who had taken pictures of 
themselves and sent them to others (over half by 
mobile phones).  
 
In 2009 the majority of the victims of CSAM 
production were aged 13–17, and overall more than 
half of the producers arrested had committed a 
contact sexual offence, documented in the images 
taken.25 
 
This data is now quite old, and there is a paucity of 
comparable offence data outside the US, as many 
countries do not have the resources to research 
this area or do not disaggregate their sexual offence 
data. 
In the UK, it was reported that the number of 
offenders convicted of taking, making or distributing 
child abuse images increased by 35%, from 921 in 
2005/06 to 1,247 in 2012/13, with 2,515 offences 
reported in 2012/13 for possession.26 The Rapid

possessing or distributing CSAM) has doubled 
across the UK between 2010/2011 and 2014/15 
and that these increases have been attributed to an 
increase in the creation or distribution of indecent 
or pseudo-photographs of adults and children using 
Internet and mobile technology.28 However, others 
have argued that these increases may be due to 
more targeted and coordinated activity by the UK 
National Crime Agency and other law enforcement 
agencies.29 Earlier threat assessment reports by 
NCA-CEOP Command (2010-2012) noted changing 
patterns in the types of victimisation within seized 
images (increases in the egregiousness of the sexual 
assaults) and the ages of the children becoming 
younger and involving more females. However, 
these studies provide limited information as to the 
methodology involved in these estimates.30 
Police data from the Netherlands was used to 
examine the attributes of seized CSAM and the 
characteristics of arrested offenders. Their data was TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL10drawn from 159 police files involving 172 suspects 
investigated in 2007.31 The majority of their suspects 
(93.6%) had only one victim, and where  
there were cases of multiple suspects, these 
did not appear to be part of organised criminal 
networks. Over 98% of the suspects were male 
and ranged from 14-83 years of age, but 35% were 
under 18. Often, these were young people who 
had taken sexualised pictures and/or videos of 
themselves and/or each other. However, it has to 
be acknowledged that these were largely samples 
of convenience and are likely to represent only a 
proportion of those involved in CSAM. 
PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 
ABUSIVE IMAGES
A US study of arrests for CSAM production at two 
time-points (2000/2001 and 2006) indicated an 
increase in adolescent victims, but no increase 
in the proportion involving very young victims.32 
Many of the cases involved self-produced sexual 
images by adolescents and involving adult sex 
offenders. A third sample indicated that arrests for 
CSAM production quadrupled between 2000-2009 
which was attributed to cases of self-produced 
sexual images solicited from minors by adult 
offenders.33 However, of note is that in 2009 most 
youth-produced images were distributed, usually 
by youth who took pictures of themselves and 
sent them to others. Images were uploaded to the 
Internet in approximately 1 in 10 cases. Although 
there has been an increase in the amount of CSAM 
produced by adolescents in the context of coercive 
relationships, the NJOV-3 survey indicated that most 
CSAM was still produced by adult offenders. Adults 
either created images of minors themselves (37%) 
or enticed minors to produce images (39%). Adult-
produced images were more likely to be perpetrated 
by a family member, have victims younger than 
12-years of age, be perpetrated by offenders aged 
26 or older and who also possessed CSAM images

Of importance in relation to deterrence was that 
the authors concluded that increases in arrests were 
related to high levels of law-enforcement activity by 
agencies trained to respond to technology-facilitated 
crimes. 
The introduction of technological landmarks such 
as the Internet, digital cameras, and smart phones 
over the past two decades has radically altered the 
way offenders sexually exploit children.34 Currently, 
researchers have looked at the difference between 
offenders using ‘active, real-time’ platforms (i.e. 
live streaming and webcams) to transmit material 
versus those who use passive platforms (i.e. 
Torrents) to distribute CSAM. The complexities 
around determining the amount of CSAM that 
exists can be explored through image production 
through commercial exploitation. An example of 
live streaming of child sexual abuse for payment is 
provided by Terre des Hommes Netherlands who 
conducted research in nineteen English-language 
public chat rooms where four researchers posed 
as pre-pubescent Filipino girls. The researchers 
then waited for people to make contact and 
request a webcam sex performance. Contacts were 
reminded that they were interacting with a pre-
pubescent child. If they continued to request a sex 
show, researchers began working to identify them. 
During the 10-weeks observation 20,172 offenders 
attempted to engage in live streaming of sexual 
abuse.35 A systematic study of US Internet-facilitated 
sexual exploitation was examined through data 
from 569 arrests in 2006. 36 Offenders either used 
the Internet to purchase or sell access to identified 
children for sexual purposes, including CSAM 
production (36%), or used the Internet to purchase 
or sell images they possessed but did not produce. 
A qualitative study of Swedish youth commercially 
exploited online indicated that this included the 
purchase of CSAM, ranging from semi-nude pictures 
to live-streaming.37
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL11CHARACTERISTICS OF OFFENDERS
It has been consistently noted across studies 
that CSAM offenders represent a heterogeneous 
group, who display wide variation in their sexual 
preoccupation with CSAM and their motivation to 
offend. 38 In relation to this, it has been observed39 
that a fundamental problem with prevention  
policy in the criminal justice system is that it is 
largely based on stereotypical, and often mistaken, 
characterisation of sex offender populations — for 
example the common view of them as exclusively 
adult males who have a sexual orientation towards 
pre-pubescent children (paedophiles) and who are 
strongly motivated to offend. While the majority 
of offender-related research has used samples of 
people convicted of technology-mediated abuse and 
exploitation, there have been a few studies drawn 
from general population samples as well as people 
who were seeking help. For example, an online 
survey of 8,718 German men, found that 4.1% 
reported sexual fantasies involving prepubescent 
children, 3.2% reported sexual offending against 
prepubescent children, and 0.1% reported a 
pedophilic sexual preference.  Men who reported 
exclusive use of CSAM were identified as a subgroup 
who differed from contact sexual offenders against 
prepubescent children and men who reported 
both CSAM use and contact sexual offenses against 
prepubescent children.40 A further US study 
recruited 262 females and 173 males through an 
online survey to examine sexual interest and adverse 
childhood experiences. Six per cent of men indicated 
some likelihood of having sex with a child if they 
could get away with it (as did 2% of women)

likelihood of viewing CSAM on the Internet.41 In  
offender samples, differences have been found  
between CSAM offenders and contact offenders 
in relation to higher levels of Internet use,42 lower 
levels of anti-social behaviour,43 differences in 
empathy44 and evidence of compulsive or addictive 
behaviour.45 However, much of the offender-related  
research has focused on risk of a CSAM offender 
either having a prior history of contact offending or 
whether they will go on to commit a further contact 
offence.46 Two significant studies in relation to risk 
come from Canada, with the development of the 
Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool (CPORT),47 and 
the UK (KIRAT: Kent Internet Risk Assessment Tool).48 
THE SEXUAL CONTENT OF ABUSIVE 
IMAGES
One area that has been standardised is the 
terminology used to grade the sexual activity 
depicted in CSAM. An example of this would be the 
COPINE scale developed by Quayle and colleagues 
that sorts sexual activity into ten categories.49 This 
scale was later adapted to a 5-point scale to grade 
images by the Sentencing Advisory Panel.50 However, 
the scale has not been incorporated into many law 
enforcement and hotline databases and, instead, is 
used more for prosecution and academic purposes. 
Researchers have coded samples of images and 
reported trends within specific databases over a 
given timeframe, but there has yet to be a global 
effort to code and report trends in sexual activity.  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL12While anecdotally, law enforcement and hotline 
analysts have expressed concern over sexual content 
of the material becoming more aggressive51 and 
the proportion of violent material increasing,52 
there is little consistent empirical evidence. Though 
reporting the sexual activity in CSAM may appear 
straightforward, a given cases could involve multiple 
victims, as well as multiple offenders, there are 
tensions around what exactly is recorded. Some 
victims may experience different levels of abuse  
or violence. Likewise, not every image or video 
may contain the same level of sexual activity. 
Additionally, when reporting trends, it is not always 
clear whether only new material during a timeframe 
will be used to generate estimates on the amount of 
violence, or all the material seen circulating during 
the timeframe. For instance, if there is a greater 
market for violent imagery, law enforcement may 
find that offenders are recirculating older material 
that is extremely violent, which would be missed if 
only new material was used to examine trends.
CHARACTERISTICS OF VICTIMS
While there is extensive research on offenders, 
very little is known about the children depicted in 
sexually abusive material, especially in the global 
landscape. To date, much of the research has 
involved identified victims within law enforcement 
databases, which may not be representative of the 
general population of children who are sexually 
exploited online, particularly as a limited number 
of countries are compiling databases of CSAM and 
where they do exist these tend to be from the global 
north. We also have very little evidence to help us 
differentiate between identified and non-identified 
children who have been abused in the production 
or exchange of CSAM. Studies of the databases that 
do exist, suggest there are more female victims 
than males, significantly more white than non-
white victims, and that most children featured in 
material are prepubescent.53 CSAM can, however, 
be produced across different contexts which, as 
previously discussed, may reflect changes in our 
relatively recent ability to create digital content. A 
study of 3,503 Swedish 18-year-old youth, indicated

59 IWF (2014), “IWF Operational trends 2014: Overview”.that 6.5% of those who reported sexual abuse had 
also experienced the abuse being documented in  
pictures or videos.54 In an early study by the same 
researcher, children identified in seized CSAM 
were interviewed and their images analysed. All 
of these were taken during acts of sexual abuse 
by the perpetrators who, in some cases, had also 
distributed the CSAM. No images were produced by 
the children.55 A further study from Turkey 56 (2015) 
examined the medical records of 662 sexual abuse 
victims referred through the courts to a Child and 
Adolescent clinic. Ninety-three reported at  
least one of the following: online/offline sexual acts 
through e-mail, cell phones, text messages, and 
Internet sites; an image of the victim of a sexual 
nature or of the sexual abuse itself recorded on a 
mobile phone/camera, with threats of distribution 
if s/he did not continue sexual acts; the image 
shared online/offline; and the victim subjected 
to online harassment or offline sexual abuse by 
other offenders that knew about the image.57 For 
these children, digital technology was significantly 
associated with more severe forms of abuse, such as 
penetrative sex, recurrent sexual abuse and multiple 
offenders.
This victim-focused research reflects evidence also 
seen in offender studies of the production and use 
of CSAM images as part of the offence process.58 
By the end of 2015, the International Child Sexual 
Exploitation Database (ICSE DB) included data on 
more than 8,000 identified victims from nearly 50 
countries, but still little was known about these 
children. ChildBase is a database developed by the 
Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre 
(CEOP) and consisted of CSAM images gathered 
from police seizures across the United Kingdom. In 
a randomised sample of 24,550 unique sexualised 
images of children from the database (approximately 
10%), it was found that the images contained 
four times more girls than boys and almost 10 
times more white than non-white children. The 
UK Internet Watch Foundation reported that after 
analysing all child sexual abuse URLs in 2014, 80% 
of all the children were 10 years or younger.59 The 
Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image Database 
(ICSE DB) contains important information about  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL13child abuse image crimes. A recent study quantified  
the characteristics of 687 children in identified  
illegal images, from the UK claimed cases from the 
database, and described the differences between 
cases of self-taken images and those whose images 
had been taken by others.60 The analysis showed 
an increase in identified victims during the study 
years 2006-2015. Almost two thirds of the children 
identified were female, the majority were white and 
44.3% were self-taken (34.4% taken in a coercive 
and 9.9% in a non-coercive relationship). The data 
also indicated that since 2010, the number of self-
taken images each year exceeded more than 40%  
of the total number of images in the database. 
Although self-taken images could potentially be 
perceived as less worrisome, two-thirds of all the 
images within this study were classified as coercive. 
However, the yearly reports of organisations such 
as the Internet Watch Foundation would suggest 
that there are fluctuations in the characteristics 
of the children depicted in CSAM. In 2015 the IWF 
reported that material involving prepubescent 
children made up a smaller fraction of all reports 
(69%) than was seen in 2012 (81%), with pubescent 
victims increasing; however, the amount of material 
involving children two years old or younger 
remained constant over the same four-year span 
(about 3-4%).61 By 2016 the IWF had seen a further 
overall drop in the children assessed as being 10 
or younger and an increase in reports of children 
11-15. This proportionate drop was felt in part to 
be related to the increase in self-produced content 
which had been shared online, alongside of the fact 
that the IWF also actively searches for images (which 
exceeded public reports in 2016) and therefore were 
more likely to encounter more images of 11-15-year 
olds. In their report there were also fewer images 
falling into categories A (penetrative sexual activity) 
or B (non-penetrative activity) in either 2014 or 
2015. Differences were also seen between data from 
the Canadian Centre for Child Protection in 2008 
which showed that 49.64% of child victims were 
under the age of eight years old62 when compared 
with the ChildBase study which showed relatively 
low numbers of very young victims (only 0.7% of 
females and 1.6% of males were infant/toddlers).63

UNIDENTIFIED-VICTIMS-IN-CHILD-SEXUAL-EXPLOITATION-MATERIAL.pdf. A further study examined two different datasets 
from the NCMEC database of identified children.64 
This included actively traded cases (518 cases 
involving 933 victims which were seen in 5 or more 
reports to NCMEC) from 2002-2013 and identified 
child victims (1,965 cases including one offender 
and one victim and 633 cases involving multiple 
offenders/victims from July 2011-June 2014) 
whether traded or not. The most notable finding 
from the first dataset was a trend towards more 
egregious sexual content over time (more abusive 
sexual content in later years), but with no obvious 
trends in relation to child victim age or gender. In 
the second dat set involving a single offender and 
victim, cases that were actively traded involved 
pre-pubescent victims, more egregious sexual 
content, and more likely to involve familial offenders 
(particularly nuclear family members). 
However, in the second dataset of 1.965 cases 61% 
of cases involving single victims and 42% where 
there were multiple relationships the children were 
pubescent. Most cases involved male offenders who 
were unrelated to the child, but cases that involved 
female offenders, younger children or more extreme 
content were likely to involve family members. In a 
further analysis of the ICSE database of unidentified 
victims conducted by ECPAT International and 
Interpol,65 64.8% were girls, 31.1% were boys and 
the remaining 4.1% included children of both 
genders. Where boys were depicted the content 
was more egregious. Within this dataset 93.9% of 
the children were white, and where age could be 
determined, the largest group were pre-pubescent 
(56.2%). Similar to the NCMEC analysis there was 
also a relationship between the age of the victim 
and the severity of the abuse. Across the three 
studies ( NCMEC, ICSE UK and ECPAT/Interpol) very 
young children were in the minority (6% and 3% of 
the second data set from NCMEC; 4.3% in the total 
ICSE DB unidentified children and approximately 6% 
of the ICSE UK claimed cases of identified children). 
In the first dataset from NCMEC of only actively 
traded cases between 2002-2013, the number of 
infants victimised varied between years (6.5-12.4%), 
but the lowest value related to 2013. 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL14OBJECTIVE
The objective of this report was to speak with 
experts in this field to uncover why trends in 
the data may be occurring. We were particularly 
interested in experts’ opinions on trends in the 
age of victims of online child sexual exploitation 
(OCSE) and the severity of the sexual activity being 
depicted in CSAM. Furthermore, we intended to 
explore national databases in order to contribute 
to establishing standards and global metrics of 
CSAM to promote evidence-based advocacy 
and programming. We wished to document 
the interaction between key variables (amount 
of material, the production and distribution of 
material, offender characteristics, the sexual content 
of material, and victim characteristics). 
MAPPING EXISTING DATABASES  
Collections of data that relate to CSAM fall largely 
into two groups: hash collections and image 
collections. The hashing process is a mathematical 
algorithm that produces a hexadecimal numeric 
value relating to binary data. A hash value is a 
small, convenient number used to track or sort an 
arbitrary block of data. Each image file hash value 
is represented by a unique string of 32 characters, 
effectively without visible order, sequence, or 
connection to the actual file name or content of 
the image.66 According to Microsoft, data can be 
compared to a hash value to determine its integrity. 
Usually, data is hashed at a certain time and the 
hash value is protected in some way. At a later time, 
the data can be hashed again and compared to the 
protected value. If the hash values match, the data 
has not been altered. If the values do not match, 
the data has been corrupted. For this system to 
work, the protected hash must be encrypted or kept 
secret from all untrusted parties.67 However, it is also 
important to distinguish between image databases 
and image libraries. The former is fully searchable 
and contains associated metadata related to cases 
within data, (such as hash sets) that can be exported 
and shared with others. An image library is more 
akin to a flat file/folder structure where material 
may be grouped together on a case by case basis, 
but cross-comparison of the data is not really 
possible, and there are significant limits to what can 
be exported from it.68 There are

some smaller police agencies around the world, or 
those who are just starting a victim identification 
unit. Other organisations maintain their own hash 
sets, which may facilitate workload management 
in terms of recognising material that has already 
been seen so that it can either be discounted from 
the victim identification process or that it can be 
precategorised for the court process because it has 
already been categorised previously (for example 
through determining the age of the child or the 
nature of the image content).69 At present there is 
limited connectivity between databases. 
At an international level, as referred previously, 
INTERPOL houses and maintains the ICSE Database, 
and also the ICCAM database on behalf of INHOPE. 
EUROPOL hosts and maintains IVAS (Investigation 
Video and Audio System), which is a database 
of material generally seized by law enforcement 
agencies in EU member states or countries with 
third party agreements with EUROPOL (e.g. 
Australia, Canada or the USA) or seized as a result 
of joint investigations in these countries. Project 
Vic70 maintains a hash (and associated meta-data) 
database for material seized and held in the US 
and administers rules of engagement for the 
various Project Vic members around the world 
(Law Enforcement Agencies, Non-Government 
Organisations, Industry etc.). While there is no 
international hash database provided by Project Vic, 
international collaboration may take place under 
the auspices of Project Vic, but this currently take 
place on a bilateral basis.71 The National Center for 
Missing and Exploited Children acts as the clearing 
house for seized material from federal and local  law 
enforcement agencies in the USA and in  
doing so contributes to both NGO and Industry 
hash-sharing platforms which extend beyond the 
USA into International organisations.
At a national level, of the countries currently 
connected to ICSE, the following maintain databases 
of seized material: Australia (the Australian Police 
and the Queensland Police Service both have  
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL15separate databases, and there is a project in place 
to provide a national solution giving direct access 
to all states and territories); Belgium; Canada (the 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police maintain a national 
database which has limited functionality from the 
various provincial and regional agencies in Canada. 
The Ontario Provincial Police and Toronto also 
maintain their own collections to assist with their 
victim identification function); Denmark; France; 
Germany; Netherlands; New Zealand; Sweden; 
United Kingdom (UK Child Abuse Images Database: 
CAID); United States (Homeland  
72 Ibid.
73 Howard, D. (2018, personal communication). Network Services & Training Manager, INHOPE.Security Investigations and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation also have their own collections, as do 
other agencies such as the US Postal Service and 
the Department of Justice). It is likely that there are 
other image libraries in Austria, Finland, Ireland, 
Israel, Italy, Japan, Moldova, Norway, Spain and 
Switzerland used as an aid to victim identification.72
 
An example of a hash database is provided by 
INHOPE, an international network of hotlines, as 
described below.73
BOX 1: INHOPE and the ICCAM system  
INHOPE is the global umbrella organisation uniting national Internet hotlines engaged in combating online 
child sexual exploitation and child sexual abuse material. The mission of INHOPE is to support and enhance 
the work of these hotlines to strengthen international efforts to combat child sexual abuse using a multi 
stakeholder approach. The network consists of 51 hotlines in 45 countries worldwide. When members 
of the public come across child sexual abuse material on the Internet, they can anonymously report the 
suspected illegal content to the hotline in their country. The aim of the INHOPE Hotline Network is to 
streamline processes for reporting illegal online content when it involves the sexual abuse or exploitation 
of a child. Hotlines often encourage reporting even for suspected exploitation, such as ‘child modelling’ 
(INHOPE, 2016). 
In 2015 INHOPE with the support and funding from the European Commission developed and launched the 
ICCAM (I-‘’See’’ (c)-Child-Abuse-Material) system initially as a pilot project and ultimately was rolled out to 
the full INHOPE network. The Hotlines receive reports from the public on potentially illegal content. These 
reports that contain a URL pointing at the content, are entered in the ICCAM system. 
Crawling and assessment:  ICCAM crawls the URL and downloads images and video to a centralised 
infrastructure based in INTERPOL. The system then allows the Hotline analyst via a browser to remotely 
classify the content under predetermined criteria (e.g. baseline and national). Once the content has been 
confirmed as child sexual abuse material the relevant elements of the report are forwarded to the INHOPE 
Hotline in that country. 
Hashing technology: As part of this, hashing technology is deployed to ’finger-print’ reported images and 
video, which allows for more rapid action in the work flow and automatic flagging of ‘new’ confirmed 
CSAM content that has not been reported to or seen by law enforcement previously. ‘New’ confirmed 
CSAM content is automatically flagged to law enforcement victim identification team in INTERPOL. This 
also minimises duplication of effort as analyst can see what has already been assessed as illegal (baseline 
or national) even if the content reported was a totally separate report to another Hotline at any point 
in the past. All of these elements speed up report handling plus reduce the amount of traumatic CSAM 
material that Hotline analysts must view. A simple reflection of these factors is the ‘’Notice & Takedown 
statistic’’ which has improved dramatically to where 75% of confirmed CSAM reports were removed from 
the Internet within 72 hours (INHOPE 2016 Annual Report).
Data:  ICCAM has the ability to gather almost real-time global data on the trends and statistics on the 
dissemination of online CSAM and the consequential actions by hotlines (e.g. notice and takedown times). 
This allows for period-by-period comparison and analysis. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL16An example of an image database is provided below.
BOX 2: Interpol ICSE Database 
The Interpol Child Sexual Exploitation Image database (ICSE database). It was launched in March 2009 as the 
successor to the Interpol Child Abuse Image Database (ICAID), which had been in use since 2001. To meet 
the challenges of technological change the ICSE-DB has been updated on several occasions and version four 
of the database is currently under development, through financial support from the European Commission, 
to enhance connectivity with national child abuse material databases. ICSE-DB is the only global platform of 
its kind which enables specialist law-enforcement officers to use image and video comparison software to 
identify victims, abusers and locations through an analysis of images, videos and hashes. 
The ICSE Database is available through INTERPOL’s secure global police communications system, I-24/7, and 
certified users in member countries can access the database directly and in real time, providing immediate 
responses to queries related to child sexual exploitation investigations. This both facilitates the identification 
of children but also manages potential duplication of efforts that would occur if multiple law enforcement 
agencies were attempting to identify the same victim or victims. Countries seeking access to the database 
need to demonstrate the existence of national legislation in relation to child sexual abuse material (CSAM), 
a specialist national victim identification unit, and sufficient connectivity to support the use of the database. 
This database is managed by Interpol and provides a powerful intelligence and investigative tool that 
allows specialised investigators to share information with colleagues on a global basis. The information 
in the database relates to children, identified through image analysis and specialist and routine policing, 
whose images meet the criteria for indecency across most jurisdictions (see Gillespie, 2010) as well as 
indicative material that may not meet these criteria but may be a valuable source of intelligence. In 2015, 
the ICSE DB included data on 8,000 identified victims from more than 50 countries, as well as data related 
to numerous unidentified victims, whose cases are yet to be investigated (http://www.interpol.int/Crime-
areas/Crimes-against-children/Victim- identification). By January 2017 Interpol reported that the network 
of 53 countries had identified 10,000 sexual abuse victims in the last seven years (https://www.interpol.int/
News-and-media/News/2017/N2017-001). Images or videos that are uploaded to the ICSE-DB are verified 
as to whether they are already known to the system, or whether the child or children within the media, or 
the suspect or offender, is already known to the system. These constitute known cases. 
As can be seen from the previous section on 
public reports, a number of the hotlines provide 
yearly information on public reports and proactive 
searching. A brief overview of this data from the 
IWF, CyberTipline and Cybertip.ca is presented here.
IWF: In 2016 59,550 reports were received which 
were assessed as criminal content from a total of 
105,420 reports, representing a 12.5% decrease 
from 2015. Age profiles of children suggested an 
increase in self-produced content, with public 
reports more likely to be of children 10 years old 
and under. The IWF classification of the images 
indicated that nearly half of children under 15 
years of age were in either Category A or B (the 
two most egregious categories), although this 
represented a decline from previous years. Their 
report indicated an increase in the number of 
domains hosting CSAM, and of these 80% of all 
webpages that contained CSAM were concentrated 
across five domains: .com; .net; .se; .io, and .cc. Social networks were the least likely to contain 
CSAM and image hosting sites the most consistent 
for hosting CSAM. 2016 saw Europe hosting 
more identified pages containing CSAM than any 
other region , representing a 19% increase for 
2015. The top five countries hosting CSAM URLs 
were: the Netherlands; the US; Canada; France 
and Russia. There was a decline in the number 
of newly identified hidden services and a large 
decrease in the number of web pages deemed to be 
commercial. 
CyberTipline: This is a US-based service and is 
hosted by NCMEC. Their data showed an increase 
of 90% between 2014 to 2015 in reports alleged 
child sexual exploitation or sexual extortion, with 
1,428 sexual extortion reports being made between 
October 2013 to April 2016. The majority of these 
reports came from Internet companies, but 24% 
came from child victims. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL17Cybertip.ca: This is operated by the Canadian Centre 
for Child Protection. Between 2002-2009 the hotline 
responded to over 215,000 CSE reports from the 
public (with 514 arrests).74 Data from their Survivor’s 
Survey of 150 adults indicated that all had been 
subjected to child sexual abuse and video-recorded. 
61% of those responding to the online survey felt 
that it was likely their images had been distributed. 
The primary perpetrators were family members or 
part of the extended family (82%), 87% said they 
were under 11 years when the abuse started and for 
42% the abuse lasted over ten years. Over the last 
15 years, over 266,000 reports had been received 
by cybertip.ca, with over 19,000 forwarded to a 
Canadian law enforcement agency. 
74 Bunzeluk K. (2009), “Child Sexual Abuse Images: An Analysis of Websites by cybertip.ca”, Winnipeg: Canadian Centre for Child 
Protection, accessed 20 January 2018,  https://docplayer.net/19341017-Child-sexual-abuse-images-an-analysis-of-websites-by-
november-2009.html. INHOPE Foundation: In 2014, 89,758 URLs were 
reported to this global network of hotlines, which 
was a 63% increase from 2013. In 2014 most CSAM 
was identified on image hosting sites, websites, file 
hosting sites, social networking sites and banner 
sites. Ninety-one per cent of images were hosted for 
non-commercial purposes. The INHOPE 2016 report 
indicated that the network received 9,357,240 
reports with 8,474,713 confirmed as CSAM and 
suggested that the majority of CSAM encountered 
by hotlines depicted predominantly pre-pubescent 
females. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL182. STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE
There have long been calls for global metrics for 
CSAM but these are very difficult to establish given 
the complexity of these crimes. Specifically, global 
metrics would aid in evidence-based advocacy and 
programming. Research continues to be limited by 
lack of standards, size of sample, or generalizability 
of findings. For a range of reasons, most research 
and analysis of CSAM has previously focused on 
single databases or even subsets of images from 
within a database. However, as technology rapidly 
advances, CSAM is more and more becoming a 
globalised concern and the need for bigger picture 
analysis is strong. This study therefore aimed to 
frame the analysis of CSAM trends in a much more 
global perspective. 
The design therefore was to broaden our net as 
much as possible for a global perspective. We aimed 
to gather detailed perspectives from a sample of 
CSAM experts from all over the world. We sought 
to establish and understand trends in victim, 
offender and content characteristics over time. 
We sought also to examine the trends identified 
in our qualitative data with preliminary analysis of 
complementary quantitative data from multiple 
sources wherever we could.
QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS
Semi-structured expert interviews with the primary 
objective of investigating perceived trends in the age 
of victims and the severity of the sexual activity in 
CSAM formed the basis of this study. 
An interview guide was developed that covered a 
breadth of topics thought to impact OCSE (Appendix 
A). The interview guide covered victim profiles, 
common characteristics of CSAM, offender profiles, 
changes in the sexual content of CSAM, changes in 
production and distribution methods, and questions 
about how policy and practice around online sexual 
exploitation could be improved. We chose these 
topic areas given their relevance to developing 
global metrics as well as their potential to identify 
both the age of victims and the sexual activity in the 
material. We wished to explore whether there were 
 
 
75 Bryant, Antony and Charmaz, Kathy (Eds.) (2007), “The SAGE Handbook of Grounded Theory”, Los Angeles: Sage, accessed 3 
February 2018, https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/the-sage-handbook-of-grounded-theory/book234413. changes in the ages of the children or the severity of 
sexual activity as evidenced in CSAM. 
We interviewed law enforcement agents and hotline 
analysts who had at least one year of current 
experience working with CSAM since they would 
be able to speak to current incidents and recent 
changes. This population was also selected because 
they would be familiar with material involving 
both undetected and detected offenders as well as 
unidentified and identified victims.
Respondents were recruited with invitations and 
flyers that were distributed to key stakeholders and 
organizations. Once participants were recruited and 
screened for eligibility, they were consented into the 
study. Studies were primarily conducted in English, 
with a small portion being conducted in Spanish. 
While it was a requirement that the participants 
fluently speak English or Spanish, it was often not 
the participants’ primary language. Two participants 
used professional translators to participate in the 
study. Interview extracts from all the participants 
have been edited with brackets for readability.
The research team was composed of a Research 
Leader and a Research Assistant. Both team 
members had Master’s degrees in public 
health or health sciences and several years of 
research experience. Both team members had 
conducted national and international research 
on the prevention of child sexual abuse and were 
knowledgeable in OCSE. They both were certified 
in ethical human subject research and had previous 
training in qualitative interviewing, transcription, 
and analyses. The Research Assistant had 
professional qualifications in Spanish language skills 
and had conducted previous interviews in Spanish. 
Interviews were analysed using the grounded-
theory method.75 The team members were trained 
to conduct semi-structured interviews following 
the interview guide (Appendix A). Interviewers 
walked the participant through a series of discussion 
topics related to the study goals and objectives but 
had flexibility to probe further on topics in which 
the participant was particularly knowledgeable. 
Interviews took approximately thirty minutes to one  
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL19hour. Following the interview, audio files were  
transcribed. In the case of Spanish interviews, 
transcripts were also translated. Two initial  
transcripts were coded line by line, and then  
line codes were compiled into a codebook. After 
the codebook was developed, three transcripts 
were double coded to check for consistency and 
understanding in applying codes. Codes were then 
applied to the remaining transcripts. These codes 
were analysed and organised to identify emergent 
themes.
A total of 18 qualitative interviews were conducted. 
Participants were from EUROPOL and INTERPOL, as 
well as hotlines and agencies in Australia, Colombia, 
Finland, France, Mexico, New Zealand, the United 
Kingdom, Slovenia, Spain, South Africa, and Taiwan. 
COMPLEMENTARY QUANTITATIVE DATA
Our search for such quantitative data encountered 
some expected barriers. Many agencies around 
the world simply lack the resources to generate 
and maintain complex databases, and where they 
do, data provides a particular picture based on 
local priorities. Where databases do exist, access 
is usually closely limited for obvious and justified 
reasons. Comparisons between these sources 
can also be complicated given it is collected along 
procedural rather than research priorities.
76  See e.g. NetClean (2016), “10 important insights into child sexual abuse crime: the NetClean report 2016”.Invitations and flyers were initially distributed to law 
enforcement and hotline agencies around the globe 
requesting data on CSAM. This recruitment method 
failed to yield significant data. The team then instead 
asked law enforcement and hotline analysts who 
participated in the qualitative portion of the study 
to provide quantitative data. Four agencies agreed 
to supply data for the project. These agencies 
varied greatly in the type of data they shared. See 
Appendix B for added detail of what was supplied by 
the four agencies. 
Cautions on the reliability of existing CSAM 
databases being used to draw conclusions 
about trends have been noted previously.76 The 
quantitative data that we were able to collect for 
this study therefore doesn’t allow for representative 
conclusions. However, it is presented throughout the 
results section in parallel to the trends identified by 
the experts in the qualitative data.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL203. RESULTS
Qualitative interviews with 18 experts from around 
the globe were used to discuss trends in OCSE, 
specifically, interviews were focused on trends in the 
age of victims of OCSE and the severity of the sexual 
activity being depicted in CSAM. To fully understand 
how and why these changes were taking place, 
the qualitative interview guide sought to develop a 
framework around participants’ background and  
experience working with CSAM, characterise the 
‘typical’ victim depicted in material, discuss changes 
in the sexual content, production, and distribution 
methods of material, and review current policy and 
practice methods that could be improved or built 
upon. Below, each component is further explored.
 
UNDERSTANDING WHO  
PARTICIPATED
Participants were law enforcement agents 
and hotline analysts who had at least a year of 
experience working with child sexual abuse material; 
however, most of the participants had served their 
departments considerably longer, with the upper 
limit being approximately 20 years of service. 
Participants described their roles as incredibly 
demanding, with many taking on far more 
responsibilities than merely investigating or 
analysing material. They often worked with small 
teams of individuals and felt their departments 
were underfunded or in need of additional staff. 
The individuals spoke to the variety of activities 
they performed, including analysing material, 
investigating perpetrators, identifying victims, coding 
material, and educating the public. Below one 
investigator describes the educational aspect of his 
position:
“[in my department] we are also 
responsible for going out to provide 
public education where we are warning 
the public about the dangers of cyber 
space; clearly emphasising the issue 
of distribution of ‘child pornography’, 
creation of ‘child pornography’, and, 
also, production…” 
 
 
 
 
77  Netclean (2015), “Eleven Unbelievable Truths: The NetClean Report 2015”, 39, 40.Similar demands on law enforcement were noted in 
NetClean’s qualitative study, with one of their eleven 
truths being supported by the fact that “17% 
of [police] say identifying victims is not prioritized 
in their organization” and “63% say they have too 
much material to go through to have time to work 
on identifying victims”.77 Being responsible for so 
many different aspects of the investigation greatly 
affected what participants could accomplish. 
We asked our participants about their current 
caseload, and they ranged widely in how many 
cases they investigated the past year. Some 
participants reported their teams focused on a very 
small number of cases (30-50), while others had 
the resources to analyse hundreds of reports. We 
discussed whether the current caseload was similar 
or different than previous years, and most agreed 
they were receiving more material, but were not 
always able to investigate more cases. They felt that 
advances in technology and changes in reporting  
procedures had led to their agencies receiving more 
reports or uncovering more imagery than they had 
previously. As one hotline analyst described:
“I suppose the workload increases […] 
because we do a lot of work where we 
will work with our local police forces, 
who may come to us for advice and 
assistance. As we’ve become a more 
established team and people know 
who we are and the mechanisms are in 
place for people to make referrals, […] 
we see an increase in the work because 
more people want to come and ask for 
our help basically.”
While an increase in reports seems like a good 
thing given the apparent increase in material being 
circulated, participants felt they could not keep 
up with the demand. Consistently, lack of funding 
prevented law enforcement from investigating the 
additional reports: 
 
 
 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL21“The amount of referrals that are 
coming in [are] increasing. From an 
output capability point of view, because 
our resources haven’t increased, we 
haven’t been able to increase the 
number of investigations that we’ve 
done, which are tied to the level of 
[resources] that we have. […] If we 
had more staff, we would have greater 
output. As I said, certainly  
the number of cases that have been 
through, to us, has increased over the 
last three or four years.”  
Some participants described hierarchies their 
agencies had in place for prioritising cases. 
Investigators discussed new material and younger 
children as the main reasons to prioritise a case. 
It is important to note that some participants did 
not prioritise any case over another since they felt 
any material featuring a subject who was under the 
age of eighteen necessitated an investigation. The 
following quote gives an example of the investigative 
hierarchies that one team leader used:
“We look at a variety of factors. We 
look at, for example, any new material, 
so if there’s content that we haven’t 
seen before, where there’s a potential 
for abuse taking place, we look at the 
severity of the material, we look at the 
number and unity of subject matter. If 
somebody’s presenting initially from 
intelligence as a clear, established boy 
lover, for example, into very young 
children, into babies, that kind of thing, 
those sorts of elements get prioritised. 
Acting in a distribution capacity, that 
would get priority over a position 
element. The lifelong extent and length 
of offending type of material, those 
would be the main [priority]. And 
ultimately if we identified that the 
username has been seen before, or the 
person has been seen as a previous 
offender, or had previous criminal 
behaviour, we would look to prioritise it 
as well.”Prioritising cases only makes sense if there are 
victims or offenders that pose greater risks to 
community safety. However, the interaction between 
these variables has not been well-documented or 
standardised. Clearly this department saw a benefit 
in prioritising cases based on a hierarchy, but that 
was not always the case. Understanding risk profiles 
or the interaction between variables (such as victim 
age, the newness of the material, or the distribution 
method used) and their potential to lead to an 
arrest or identified victim would help establish a 
best practice.
CHARACTERISING THE TYPICAL VICTIM
Every participant agreed that victims were 
predominantly white. Some participants reported 
they handled a small number of cases involving 
Asian and Hispanic children as well, but black 
children were by far the rarest. No explanation was 
given for the race disparity amongst victims. Also, 
despite the recent abundance of teen imagery 
and underage self-produced material, participants 
still anecdotally reported most victims were 
prepubescent children. 
The profile described by the reports and our 
participants did differ on the gender of victims. 
The three reports consistently show more female 
victims. However, some of our participants noticed 
that in their experience there was an even split 
between male and female victims, while others 
reported that their cases were mostly female. 
Participants were also quick to point out each 
perpetrator typically had a type and that the online 
location at which the perpetrator was discovered 
corresponded to certain gender preferences, i.e. 
being on a ‘boy-lovers’ forum. 
The majority of our participants reported that they 
had witnessed a decrease in the average age of the 
victim, or alternatively stated this as an increase in 
very young victims, although proportionately there 
were still more prepubescent and pubescent victims. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL22WHY AND WHEN DID THE AGE OF 
VICTIMS CHANGE?
Participants were unable to give an exact time the 
perceived change had taken place, but it seems to 
have been very recent. For example, one participant 
attributed the change to being within the past few 
years:
“I would say that there are more 
offenders who are interested in 
prepubescent [children] and, now, 
increasingly in the last number of years, 
in younger than prepubescent - so in 
infants and children basically.” 
Another participant described the same change in 
victims’ ages, but instead of an increasing amount, 
the participant saw it as a widening of an age 
preference that already existed amongst offenders:
“I think initially the ages were 
probably in, [or] heading towards, just 
[prepubescent] – probably in the 10 
to 14 kind of age group. We’re now 
seeing a lot that are shifting slightly 
downwards towards the 6 to 8 age 
group, and again, a slightly smaller 
portion that are under that, infants and 
toddlers. If you […] consider it a bell curve type of situation, the ages have 
shifted slightly younger, simply because 
in the early days, the bulk of the 
material presented was in that higher 
age group and now we’re looking at 
them being younger and, in many 
cases, [prepubescent].”
Another participant attributed the change to being a 
global phenomenon:
“…lately the victims are at younger 
ages. There is a tendency, I would 
say an early sexualisation of children, 
and it is true that we are seeing victims 
of increasingly early ages. […] that has 
also been the case [elsewhere].”
Given the international perspective of this project, it 
was interesting that some participants distinguished 
between the materials being produced in their 
country versus abroad. A participant from Colombia 
remarked: 
“[Younger material] is produced in 
other countries. It’s not Colombian 
pornography […] the pornography with 
younger kids are always produced in 
other countries.”BOX 3: CHILD CYBER CRIME GROUP
(Colombia)
The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is a law enforcement agency dedicated 
to investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia.
The Group provided us with a database of thousands of victims of commercial exploitation. Our analyses 
were limited to the 696 cases that involved victims of child sexual abuse material. The average age of 
victims is presented as well as the proportion of male versus female victims in the table below. Victims’ 
ages ranged from 2 years old to 17 years old with the total average age of victims being 13 years old across 
all five years. Also of note, the majority of their victims were female with only a total 13% of victims being 
males across all five years.

(France)
Point de Contact is a hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet 
Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM. The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network 
to combat OCSE. 
In the year 2015, French Point de Contact handled 4,547 cases of online child sexual abuse material. Of 
these, the victims’ ages were categoriaed as infant in 96 (2.1%) cases, prepubescent in 1,836 (40.4%), 
pubescent in 1,924 (42.3%), and indeterminate in 691 (15.2%). The victims’ gender was determined in 
4,226 (92.9%) cases, and skewed heavily towards female victims, with 3,883 (91.9%) of cases involving 
girls, 233 (5.5%) involving boys, and 110 (2.6%) involving both. Age by gender was not available from the 
summary report.
Likewise, some participants felt changes in the age 
of victims might be because the laws in their country 
surrounding CSAM and the subsequent enforcement 
of those laws were the reason they were seeing 
certain types of victims. As one participated 
explained:
“In [redacted], we see more kids 
because sometimes they can avoid 
being caught. Because, usually, they 
upload the content over a foreign 
website or crowd-host platform, so they 
can easily get away [with distributing 
material without] being caught. […] 
According to our law, child sexual abuse 
content, if your only possession, is a 
very minor crime [and] the penalty is 
you just have to pay a fine.”78
When asked why they thought the age of victims 
was getting younger, there was not a consistent 
answer as to why this change occurred. A notable 
response was the appearance of new forums on 
the Dark Net targeting those with attractions to 
very young children. The following are participants’ 
commentary on the appearance of new forums on 
the Dark Net:  
“On most of the boards, it is actually 
forbidden to post anything under 
two, but in this board, [redacted], it’s 
actually the only thing that you can 
post. You have two categories. You have 
the babies, which is between zero and 
two, and then you have the toddler 
category, which is between two and 
five. This is new, actually. […] Maybe 
there were boards [before] I didn’t 
know of, but this very popular board 
dedicated to baby lovers is kind of new.”
 
 
78  The name of the country has been redacted to keep perpetrators from further exploiting this country’s laws. “I would say we’re seeing more new 
material than we have ever seen 
before. That is down to a number of 
factors. It’s down again to the increased 
access to the Internet and increased 
access to devices through which it can 
be produced. That’s one of the less 
important factors for this material. 
What’s more important is I call it the 
focusing factor. When you have facilities 
or services like we have on the Dark 
Net and have had for the last number 
of years where individuals can come 
together. They can talk about their 
sexual preferences openly. They can  
admire the abuse that each other have 
perpetrated on children through the  
material that they’re able to contribute 
to one another and to distribute 
between one another. When you have 
forums and website available where 
they cannot be, or at least believe that 
they cannot be, traced, then those 
factors all become multiplied. The 
willingness of individuals to encourage 
others to produce material, to produce 
the material themselves, and to post it, 
and then to talk about that among each 
other is increased in those forms.”
Further discussion around Dark Net forums 
dedicated to extremely young victims suggested 
that they did not exist a few years ago and 
investigators are only now uncovering these sources 
for younger content. Furthermore, participants 
implied perpetrators might feel a sense of safety 
in discussing their attraction to extremely young 
children within these forums as well as encouraging 
each other to produce this material since such topics 
had previously been too taboo to even discuss on 
prepubescent forums.  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL24However, the Dark Net was not the only reason 
cited for the decrease in age. Another participant 
reported that the change may be due to ‘mandatory 
reporting’ laws. Mandatory reporting laws require 
individuals to report if they learn or suspect a child 
has been abused or neglected. These laws have led 
to a significant increase in reports of child sexual 
abuse. The rationale is that perpetrators might find 
it is easier to molest a child who is too young to 
speak and, thus, cannot complain or suggest they 
have been abused. If they are unable to express 
that they have been abused, an adult or caregiver 
in that child’s life is unlikely to make a report to the 
authorities. 
Another explanation was that perpetrators and 
consumers are seeking new and more extreme 
content. 
“The victims can only get so young. We 
have seen the abuse of babies and very, 
very young toddlers depicted. That’s going to play off because they can’t get 
any younger than that. We’re seeing 
that it has. [We are at] that point where 
the material is depicting the abuse for 
what it is, rather than trying to sugar 
coat is as smiling, happy faces, happy 
family time kind of thing.”
We also asked about the youngest victim 
participants had seen, and every participant had 
come across material involving an infant or toddler  
during their career, even those who did not think 
there had been a change in the age of victims. 
Several participants reported that the youngest 
child they had seen was days, weeks, or only a 
few months old. These extremely young children 
prompted the law enforcement agents to prioritise 
cases that involved younger children, especially 
when they believe the content was new or that the 
child may still be alive.

Mantel-Haenszel Chi-Square p < 0.001BOX 5: GUARDIA CIVIL
(Spain)
The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard – Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation 
of Children, is a law enforcement agency in Spain.
Only partial descriptive analysis was possible with this limited dataset. While conclusions should not be 
drawn, the analysis did not seem to indicate an increase in the number or proportion of cases involving 
infants. The first table below shows infant cases as a percentage of total cases over a six-month period. 
Overall, among unique hashes, 8.7% had an infant victim. Victims again skewed towards being female, and 
cases involving infants even more so. 72.4% of non-infant cases were female, compared to 85.0% of infant 
cases. 19.2% of non-infant cases were males and 8.5% had victims of both genders, compared to 8.8% male 
and 6.3% both for infant cases.
The Guardia Civil uses a 6-tier severity score to rate child sexual abuse content. Cases involving infants tend 
to feature more severe content, i.e. penetration and adult on child activity instead of suggestive posing 
and/or child on child activity. These differences were statistically significant using the Chi-square test (see 
bottom table).TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL26EXPLORING CHANGES IN THE SEXUAL 
CONTENT OF MATERIAL
In addition to the age of victims decreasing, there 
may be a connection between younger victims and 
more aggressive sexual content. Egregious sexual 
content was often limited to investigations on 
more private platforms or platforms that protected 
offenders’ identities, such as the Dark Net. The 
Canadian Centre for Child Protection also found 
a correlation between the age of victims and the 
severity of content in their report79 They found that 
younger victims experienced higher proportions of 
explicit and extreme sexual assault. Similar findings 
have been reported by the recent study conducted 
by ECPAT and Interpol on unidentified victims in 
child sexual exploitation material stored in the ICSE 
Database.80
Descriptions of the sexual behaviour perpetrated 
against younger children by our participants ranged 
from close-ups of genitals to forceful and sadistic 
activity. Some investigators felt there had been a 
shift from ‘older’ CSAM methods that would involve 
dressing up children and making the engagement 
seem enjoyable or pleasurable for the child whereas 
images nowadays depicted the abusive nature of act 
themselves.
“I would say that [the material] is 
becoming more and more aggressive. 
For example, […] before August 2015 
we didn’t analyse any images in TOR, 
so that might change my opinion. 
Because in torrent, 90% of content is 
[...] penetrative. In TOR, the images and 
the videos are […] the worst.”
Differences in distribution methods have been linked 
to differences in offenders and offense types in USA 
based investigation81 Likewise, NetClean’s qualitative 
study similarly found that “63% of [police] say 
anonymization technologies were a crucial challenge 
to identifying offenders who have produced child 
sexual abuse material”.82 They specifically comment 
on the difficulty that TOR presents, which was 
expressed by some of our participants as well. 
Several participants attributed the more aggressive 
activity to the false sense of security that the Dark 
Net gave them.

law enforcement. They do [enforce the 
law] and work there, and they try to 
get the offenders caught, but it’s really 
difficult, because it’s difficult to trace. 
In a way, you can share totally illegal 
material, and it’s not safe, but, in a 
way, it’s easier. You don’t get caught, 
so it’s easy. […] Why is it aggressive? 
They have the opportunity to produce 
aggressive material, and they think 
it’s really difficult to get caught. I think 
[it’s also the fact] somebody will pay a 
great amount of [money] if you produce 
aggressive material.” 
One participant perceived the online culture as 
apparently rewarding the production of younger, 
more aggressive material. The participant described 
the behaviour by saying:
“I think the more you can produce or 
exchange, the worst you can show 
to your other groups or to the other 
members of these groups, you can 
rise in the ranking or you get more 
members.”
Beyond sexual activity alone, another noticeable 
change was perpetrators disgracing their victims’ 
bodies with words:
“In recent years, the content, the 
photos by themselves are getting 
high, and the sexual activity is getting 
lewd, so we can see [offenders] put 
objects into children’s vaginas, or they 
will over... We saw some cases lately, 
[offenders] writing some words on 
children’s bodies, not good words, 
[words] like ‘bitch’. […]’She loves to 
be doing this’. So it’s not just sexual 
activity, it’s getting cruel.”
Writing words, phrases, and usernames on children’s 
bodies was also suggested as a way to prove to 
other members the material was new, belonged 
to a certain producer, or fulfilled a sort of bragging 
right. Anecdotally, it has been suggested that 
producers are scrubbing images of identifiers and 
EXIF data to protect themselves from being traced, 
so it is surprising that producers would be willing 
to risk purposefully placing an identifier to recruit 
new members or achieve a higher rank within their 
member groups.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL27BOX 6: CHILD RESCUE COALITION
(USA)
Child Rescue Coalition is a non-profit organization that partners with US and non-US investigators, police 
officers, and other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers. They mainly 
provide technological assistance as well as host a large database of CSAM hash values.
The US Child Rescue Coalition were able to provide us with a summary of categorised, new file hash values 
for the past 12 years across five categories, summarised in the table below. A hash value, in this context, 
represents an image that is known to contain illegal content. The data show the proportion of child notable 
material compared with other categories of values. Child notable material involves children age 12 and 
under. However, the organisation primarily focuses their investigative efforts on prepubescent children. 
Therefore, it is expected that the majority of images they collect will be denoted as child notable.

While the majority of participants felt the sexual 
activity had become more severe, some felt there 
had not been a noticeable difference. They still 
saw aggressive sexual activity being perpetrated 
against victims of all ages, but not a stark increase 
in violence or violence against a specific age group. 
A participant who felt the activity had remained 
constant (no more or less aggressive than in 
previous years) described content relating to age in 
the following way:
“We’ve seen cases of toddlers being 
abused. Rarely, rarely to the point of 
actual penetration, but clearly the 
offenders genitals are visible, placed 
somewhere over the victim. That is 
the kind of aggressive material we 
can witness with regards to toddlers. 
I find that the content involving male 
offenders and young prepubescent 
victims particularly aggressive because 
of the nature of the act. Because 
these children are clearly under age. 
In comparison it does seem a lot more 
shocking than when you see a

 pubescent victim who could be 18,  
but appears to be a minor. We are 
still obliged to qualify it as child abuse 
material. It’s not exactly the same type 
of abuse we witness in that case.”
 
Differences in experience and perspectives of the 
trends such as these highlight the utility in assessing 
sexual activity with the scales that have been 
developed. 
UNCOVERING THE TYPICAL OFFENDER
While the literature has focused on convicted sex 
offenders, the law enforcement agents and hotline 
analysts we spoke with gave insight into both 
detected and undetected offenders. They suggested 
offenders continue to grow more and more 
protective of their identities as technologies and 
investigative techniques advance. Every participant 
said it was rare to see an offender’s face nowadays, 
and when an offender’s face is visible, those tend to 
be adolescent offenders or ‘rookie’ offenders. For 
the most part, offenders only showed body parts  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL28and made sure no personal identifiers (i.e. scars, 
tattoos, deformities) were visible. 
“It’s extremely rare that we can see the 
offender. If we can see him, it’s only 
parts of his body, or if it’s the whole 
silhouette his face will usually be hidden 
under a mask. We hardly ever see the 
face of an offender.”
Consensus amongst interviewees was that most 
men acted alone – either purchasing sex from 
children (a problem in low-income countries), 
extorting children online through social media, or 
grooming children they were close to (i.e., family 
members). The relationship between offender 
and child changes depending on which of the 
aforementioned situations is taking place. Offenders 
of younger children tend to be intimate, with one 
participant acknowledging:
“You know, with younger kids, it 
often is either some kind of a familial 
relationship or something close to 
that like a boyfriend or something, in 
terms of having actual access to the 
child, especially at a younger age, or 
maybe we’ve seen a couple where it’s 
babysitters, but I’d say mostly it’s more  
familial relationships for the younger 
ages because of course, as soon as you 
get into the online abuse and grooming 
and things like that, it’s going to be 
total strangers rather than somebody 
that they actually know”.  
Unlike victims where participants discussed common 
characteristics, giving profiles that were supported 
by other reports, many participants felt there was 
no common characteristic amongst offenders. The 
participants who gave an offender profile often 
mentioned older males, probably in their 30s to 50s, 
who were white - a typology of convicted offenders. 
Women appear to be very rarely involved in the 
production of material, though some said they were 
starting to see women produce CSAM, especially 
when being coerced by a man (such as a boyfriend) 
or for money. One participant echoed this notation, 
stating:
“I would say [there is a] tendency for 
female offenders to accept for profit, 
because we now see an area where 
mothers are abusing children on 
[webcam] or live shows for money. 
[…] I would say the [CSAM] produced 
by women is always --as I know of— 
[coordinated by a man].”
 
 
84  Netclean. “Eleven Unbelievable Truths”. 16A few participants did imply there were times they 
saw women acting of their own volition, but again 
women were considered maybe ‘1 in every 100’ 
offenders, if that. Some participants reported that 
they never actually saw women.
IDENTIFYING PRODUCTION AND 
DISTRIBUTION METHODS
Though it is generally understood that child sexual 
abuse material is produced and distributed in a 
variety of ways, participants described investigative 
efforts as being a constant race to outpace new 
methods. 
A notable difference between today’s producers 
and old producers, are the number of mediums 
available. Participants mentioned that technology 
like digital cameras, laptops, and cell phones have 
greatly influenced who produce images. Though 
there may be some evidence that higher quality 
images are considered more valuable, cell phones 
and webcams seem to have become the norm. This 
finding is again supported by the qualitative study 
of police that found “mobile phones and videos are 
becoming increasingly common in investigations”.84 
In particular, they allow perpetrators to offend in 
their own homes and at their convenience, which 
may contribute to the age of children decreasing.  
 
A participant explained the biggest change he had 
experienced: 
“From the top of my head, I’d say 
more and more amateur content [is 
being produced]. Meaning home, self-
produced content, unfortunately. This is 
parting with the given impression that 
CSAM is something that you maybe 
find in more exotic countries, typically 
Eastern Asia with sex tourism. The 
fact is, we see more, if we’re talking 
about ethnicity here, we’ve seen a lot 
of Caucasian / white children being 
abused by what seems to be a parent 
or a close relative within the framework 
of a household. That’s what I refer to 
when I say amateur content.”
Likewise, distribution methods have grown. 
Distributors were characterised as being fluid and 
a step ahead of investigators. They often exploited 
new technologies and deftly used apps’ and other 
networks’ privacy policies to their advantage. A 
participant described distribution in the following 
way:  
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL29“It changes all the time. I mean, the 
last couple of weeks we had a high 
number of cases in Snapchat. It’s very 
newly used by [offenders]. Yeah, I think 
it changes a lot. It changes every week, 
I think, by the numbers, and every 
application. […] I think [the dark net] 
is still a high number. Peer to peer is 
same, constantly used.”
Another participant explained the popularity of live 
streaming, a distribution method that has only very 
recently become prominent: 
“I think yes, [distribution] changed a 
little bit. Not just a little, quite a bit. 
Live streaming is I think a big issue. A 
live stream abuse, or a distance abuse, 
when children are put into prostitution 
or forced into prostitution in different 
parts of the world – Southeast Asia, 
Africa, South America – things like that. 
And somebody in other continents 
would pay to view this. […] So those 
observers, payers, watchers, whatever, 
they would gather those videos for their 
own purposes, as they paid for them.”
Live streaming presents a particularly challenging 
situation to law enforcement, because if produced 
properly, there is no evidence that the crime ever 
existed, even though law enforcement may see 
evidence of money transfers and call times. Likewise, 
without witnessing the abuse, it is difficult to charge 
consumers with ‘possession’ of CSAM since there 
is no actual recording left. Furthermore, it has the 
potential to cross international jurisdictions as well 
as involve requesting assistance from the webcasting 
service. 
There also seems to be vast differences in the type 
of content hosted on each platform. As mentioned 
earlier, more aggressive and younger content are 
found on more secure places, like the Dark Web.
“The younger victims would tend to 
be in the areas that have the greater 
levels of security, and that community 
element. The overt kind of open 
platforms such as social networks and 
your standard Internet platforms would 
tend to be slightly older victims. It 
comes down to the degree of comfort 
that the individual has in terms of the 
platform they’re using and the way they 
discern the age of the victim.”
 
 
 
 “Interviewee: it has differences, because 
the pornography or the materials that 
you can find on the deep web, on the 
dark web is [more] aggressive than the 
pornography that you can find on the 
social media.
Interviewer: Are they different with 
ages and gender as well, not just sexual 
content?
Interviewee: They are younger.
Interviewer: Why [do you] think that 
they are different? Why is social media 
different than the other places?
Interviewee: It depends. […] On the 
social media they have to be more 
discreet. They have to be careful with 
the things that they are doing versus 
[other areas of the web]. Because on 
the other [websites] they don’t have to 
be careful because […] the material is 
very dark, like they are very safe.”
Anonymity, sense of safety, and more extreme 
content tend to be common characteristics of 
material distributed on the dark web. Social media 
seems to be a place where participants found older 
victims or less aggressive CSAM. These differences in 
content and victims suggest that there may be room 
for further investigation to develop risk profiles and 
investigative hierarchies.  
 
IMPACTING POLICY
Participants expressed improving policy on three 
levels: globally, nationally, and locally. Globally, 
participants wanted greater collaboration between 
law enforcement agencies during investigations. 
Some investigators related frustrations over their 
inability to secure search warrants in a timely 
manner, or hitting severe roadblocks due to 
paperwork and legalities that inhibited them from 
effectively cooperating with other investigators on 
cross-boarder cases. Furthermore, participants had 
mixed feeling about industry partners. Some felt 
they made their job easier, while others found them 
to be obstacles. A participant eloquently stated his 
opinion on the topic:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL30“We’ve all heard the phrase ‘You can’t 
prosecute your way out of this issue’. 
There is a need for a multi-disciplinary 
approach to looking at this type of 
thing, especially where we overlay 
the idea that a lot of the material is 
generated out in areas where extreme 
poverty exists, and this is a way of 
remedying that poverty, as a way 
of physically trafficking children, or 
digitally trafficking children through, 
like webcams. In terms of the offending, 
there needs to be tools that allow law 
enforcement to work together across 
jurisdictional boundaries much more 
effectively. There needs to be tools 
in place that allow the investigations 
to be done in a timely and effective 
way. There needs to be tools that 
allow case referrals to happen very 
quickly. Legislative tools that allow 
law enforcement to get subscriber 
information from other jurisdictions 
easily and quickly, and get information 
out of service providers easily and 
quickly.”
Nationally, participants wanted databases to be 
implemented and maintained. They also desired 
stricter laws for people who perpetrate these 
crimes. They felt they were often stunted by the 
ways they were allowed to investigate material 
online in comparison to other fields and wanted to be given more freedom in their approach to taking 
down material, conducting sting operations, and 
probing leads. A participant highlighted this notion:
“This is a topic I really feel that it hurts 
everyone, that as societies makes us 
look very bad. And, at the end of the 
day, the effort and the sum of all, 
not only the police. This is a job that 
must be done from different areas, 
from different strata. Both in society 
and government, and industry in the 
private sector, in companies. We all 
have a substantial responsibility in 
this. And I think that the dissemination 
of information of what is happening 
really is fundamental. Let people know 
that simply downloading a single 
image containing such is a crime and, 
therefore, can go to jail. I think that is 
fundamental. I think people need to 
know that this is a crime, a crime that 
is paid and paid dearly. People go to jail 
for doing this kind of behaviour.”
Locally, participants consistently brought up needing 
more resources and funding. They felt that while 
many people and politicians recognise online child 
sexual exploitation as a problem, they never allocate 
the appropriate funds for training, staffing, and new 
technologies. Addressing those concerns would be 
paramount in ensuring that law enforcement can 
effectively do their jobs. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL31As noted across the reviewed literature, the 
interviews with law enforcement and the limited 
complementary quantitative data presented 
here, CSAM crimes are varied and subject to 
change, terminology differs across researchers 
and practitioners, and inconsistent ways of 
operationalising and measuring CSAM makes 
comparison across studies difficult. This has had a 
negative impact on global efforts at data collection 
across different forms of child sexual abuse and 
exploitation and is evidenced to be the case with 
online CSAM. Our capacity to evaluate the scale of 
the problem in terms of the quantity of CSAM is 
compromised by the volume of online content in 
the open, and also hidden, Internet, and the reality 
that content may be removed but not destroyed and 
copied endlessly. To date we have been dependent 
on criminal justice records and public reports to 
hotlines (as well as proactive searching) for data, 
but both are subject to biases, and are likely to 
underestimate the volume of CSAM in circulation. 
Studies using data sourced from existing databases 
(such as ICSE) also face challenges as the data was 
not collected for research purposes but rather for 
operational reasons and reflects the vagaries of 
reporting and managing missing information. 
What we can conclude is that criminal justice data 
from public records, as well as research surveys, 
would suggest an increase over time in the number 
of CSAM crimes. However, some of this data is now 
quite old, and public records also reflect changes in 
legislation and recording of crimes across different 
jurisdictions. It is also difficult to unpick whether 
the increases in recorded CSAM crimes reflect 
an overall increase in these crimes, or a greater 
investment by law enforcement (possibly aided by 
technological tools) to detect and prosecute them. 
Youth-produced images also pose new challenges 
for law enforcement in terms of resource demands 
alongside their ability to determine the age of the 
child and whether they have been produced as part 
of coercive activity by adults or peers, or represent 
behaviour that is consistent with adolescent 
development and risk-taking. 
Mapping of existing national and international 
CSAM databases would suggest that they fall 
largely into two groups: hash collections and image collections. While there are a number of databases 
globally, there is limited connectivity between them. 
Differences in how data is defined and recorded 
means that it is impossible to draw firm conclusions 
as to whether there have been changes in the 
gender, age and level of violence within recorded 
CSAM. There is some suggestive evidence that the 
percentage of egregious images has increased over 
time, but inconclusive evidence in whether there are 
changes in the ages of children, except that since 
2011 there appears to have been an increase in 
the volume of CSAM involving pubescent children, 
thought to be linked with trends in growth of self-
produced content (facilitated by wider access to 
new technologies). Across three studies, younger 
victims are associated with greater levels of sexual 
violence, produced within a family context and 
more likely to be widely distributed. However, the 
preponderance of images is of pubescent and pre-
pubescent children and the numbers of images of 
very young children (infants and toddlers) remain 
relatively low. What is consistent across different 
datasets is that the majority of victims and offenders 
are white Caucasians, and while there has been 
an increase in other ethnic groups, these number 
remain disproportionately small. This does require 
further investigation given the increasing availability 
of Internet connectivity through hand-held devices 
and the concerns expressed about, for example, live 
streaming of sexual abuse. 
The qualitative results from expert interviews 
confirm the study hypothesis that victims of OCSE 
appear to be getting younger, and the decline in age 
has happened recently. However, this is far from 
clearly confirmed. The 2016 report from the IWF 
suggested a decline in the percentage of reported 
images of children under 10 from 80% in 2014 
to 53% in 2016, and a corresponding increase in 
victims aged 11-15 (18 to 45% respectively). The 
IWF concluded that this may relate to the increase 
in youth-produced images alongside the fact that 
since 2014 IWF analysts have been allowed to 
proactively search for content. The public are more 
likely than analysts to report children under the age 
of 10, and where there is more severe abuse. When 
IWF analysts find a forum with thousands of images 
of child sexual abuse, they work to remove the 
forum as well as capture the URLs of every image 4. CONCLUDING DISCUSSION AND LIMITATIONSTRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL32on there (which might be pulled from another site). 
They then seek to remove each image hosted on 
the other sites as well. The IWF conclude that this 
technique appears to be associated with finding 
more images of 11 to 15-year-old children.
The experts within the study had not reached a 
consensus as to why they concluded that the age 
of victims is decreasing, but one suggestion was 
the appearance of new forums on the Dark Net 
specifically dedicated to younger children, which 
did not previously exist. Such a market place was 
thought to naturally encourage the production 
of new material as well as facilitate its sharing. 
The Dark Net is seen as a notorious safe house 
for some of the most egregious content, and as 
law enforcement and hotline analysts begin to 
specifically target these forums, it is speculated 
that they will undoubtedly see an increase in 
young victims. Another explanation given for the 
decreasing age of victims was that offenders have 
gained a sense of safety and confidence on private 
platforms (e.g. live streaming) that make it easier to 
produce violent material. 
When participants discussed distribution methods, 
some mentioned outdated policies and legislation 
that inhibited them from being proactive in 
investigations. Similarly, a few participants suggested 
that investigative efforts have continued to be 
blocked by companies and countries that do not 
fully cooperate with law enforcement. Despite the 
ongoing international dialogue around child online 
sexual exploitation, participants believed that the 
public appears to misunderstand the gravity and 
implications of restricting investigations.
 Participants also emphasised the fact that additional 
funding would significantly help their investigative 
teams. Funding would address the majority of issues 
participants had with current practices; it would 
allow them to add staff members, in turn processing 
more cases, build national databases of images 
and videos, and appropriately train staff. It was 
felt that drastic increases in the number of cases 
reported each year and lack of funding have left 
professionals with little ability to implement valuable 
resources, such as the development of a national 
image databases, as well as annual staff training. 
Furthermore, it was suggested that efforts should 
be made to encourage collaboration between 
researchers, advocates, and law enforcement agents 
so that the field can continue to grow and promote 
best practices.
LIMITATIONS
When recruitment began for the quantitative 
portion of the study, invitations and flyers were 
distributed to law enforcement and hotline agencies 
around the globe requesting data on online sexual 
abuse images. These initial invitations yielded very 
few responses. Upon further probing, it appeared 
many countries lacked the funding and staff 
needed to maintain national databases, especially 
databases that would retain the level of detail our 
research team desired to establish standards for 
evidence-based advocacy and programming. As 
one agent acknowledged, even if his department 
was presented with additional funding, he would 
probably dedicate the funds to more investigative 
staff rather than sacrifice a team member to data 
entry and management. Other departments and 
organisations were advocating for or had recently 
received funds to establish national databases but 
were still in the beginning phases of designing and 
implementing their databases.TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL336. RECOMMENDATIONS
Law enforcement agents and hotline analysts are 
seeing changes in CSAM. However, expert opinions 
are not sufficient to establish global metrics; 
substantial quantitative data is necessary. As the 
limitations of this study suggested, there are still 
many barriers to overcome before global metrics 
and/or indicators can be developed.
 
RECOMMENDATION 1:  
Invest in the development and maintenance of a 
national database of CSAM in each country.
It is difficult to determine the cost-benefit ratio of 
agencies dedicating staff time as well as their often 
limited funds to maintaining a national database. 
However, to more effectively establish global 
trends in OCSE, it is crucial that law enforcement 
agencies throughout the world have databases or 
the ability to track relevant information about the 
material they process and investigate, including 
characteristics of offenders, victims, and the sexual 
activity depicted in the imagery.
RECOMMENDATION 2:  
Track and analyse trends in CSAM data nationally 
and globally.
Governments must track and analyse trends 
in CSAM data both at national levels and in 
cooperation with international law enforcement to 
better understand and therefore more effectively 
fight OCSE.
 
RECOMMENDATION 3:  
Promote participation in research by law 
enforcement agencies.
The benefits of evidenced-based advocacy and 
action are far reaching but collaboration is often 
restricted by the need to negotiate complex ethical 
processes associated with sharing sensitive data, 
or simply from a lack of resources. There are clear 
opportunities to foster collaboration between law 
enforcement agencies and professional researchers that would benefit both partners. Researchers 
and advocates should work to strengthen their 
relationships with law enforcement agencies and 
hotlines in order to facilitate such projects.
RECOMMENDATION 4:  
Move towards standard variables for collecting, 
storing and analyzing CSAM data.
Analysis of limited quantitative data allowed the 
research team to test assumptions about how law 
enforcement agencies collect and store CSAM data. 
It was assumed that agencies would vary slightly in 
how they collected, coded, and defined variables. 
However, vast differences were noted in what 
organisations considered important to include in 
their databases and how they maintained them. 
Some variables will need to be standardized across 
databases for global metrics to be achieved.
RECOMMENDATION 5:  
Consult stakeholders from around the globe 
to develop a set of basic shared variables and 
promote agreement to store CSAM data in line 
with these.
Bringing together key stakeholders to define 
variables and standardise the way data is captured 
within databases would assist investigators, 
advocates, and researchers in establishing and 
comparing trends. It is not enough to have large 
databases with lots of variables, rather we need 
robust databases with useful, and carefully defined 
variables to better understand and more effectively 
act to prevent this crime from happening.

Point de Contact (France)
Point de Contact is a hotline agency in France that was established by the Association of French Internet 
Providers to enable the reporting of CSAM. The organisation works in conjunction with the INHOPE network 
to combat OCSE. 
Point de Contact provided a summary report on cases reported to the hotline by year from 2010-2015. This 
report describes: a) the total number of reported cases by Internet service type (e.g. website, P2P , forum, 
etc.), b) the number of cases in each broad content category (e.g. ‘child pornography’, child nudism, adult 
pornography accessible to children, etc.), c) the number of cases from each country of origin, and d) the 
action taken by the agency on each case. 
Point de contact was unable to provide victim details (such as age or gender). However, these data can be 
used to inform how CSAM comes to the attention of a national reporting hotline, and to help identify gaps 
that might exist in law enforcements’ current approach to identifying exploitive images. 
Point de Contact also provided a summary report of information hosted in France provided by INHOPE for 
the months of Jan-Nov 2015. The report describes the total number of actions taken by French authorities, as 
well as the gender and age distributions (infant, prepubescent, pubescent) of cases. The data supplied only 
spans the past year, so it was impossible to determine temporal trends. 
Guardia Civil (Spain)
The Technical Unit of the Judicial Police within the Civil Guard – Division of Children and Sexual Exploitation of 
Children, is a law enforcement agency in Spain.
Guardia Civil provided a partial database from 2008 to 2016 that describes online material that the police 
have investigated. At the time of data collection, this agency is in the process of categorising their data, and 
so additional data might be available at a future point. From the data provided it was unclear how much data 
from each year had been included in the dataset.
For all investigated material, this database included the six-month window in which the material 
was identified (e.g., July-Dec 2014), both a broad content description (e.g., ‘sexual activity between 
children’,’sexual activity between an adult and child’) and more specific content description, victim age 
categories (0-13 years, 13-18 years) and whether an infant appears in the content. 
These data are the most pertinent to the primary research question. While offender information and other 
victim demographic information (e.g. race) are missing, the content descriptions may provide an opportunity 
to examine temporal trends in content severity and the presence of young children. 
Child Cyber Crime Group - Colombian National Police
The Child Cyber Crime Group within the Colombian National Police is a law enforcement agency dedicated to 
investigate online sexual exploitation of children in Colombia.
The Child Cyber Crime Group provided a database of Colombian victims of sexual exploitation from 2010 to 
July 2016. Given that not all the cases pertained to online child exploitation, our investigation was limited to 
cases denoted as victims of CSAM. Victim age and gender are summarised by year. These data are extremely 
useful for our primary research question; however, there are too few cases to detect statistically significant 
differences. However, we do see agreement between interviewers and the national database. TRENDS IN ONLINE CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE MATERIAL41Child Rescue Coalition (United States of America)
Child Rescue Coalition is a non-profit organization that partners with US investigators, police officers, and 
other key stakeholders to aid in the apprehension and conviction of child abusers. They mainly provide 
technological assistance as well as host a large database of CSAM hash values.
Child Rescue Coalition provided us with a brief data summary from 2004 to June 2016 that describes the 
number of new image hash values they categorised each year from law enforcement. While this agency has 
access to millions of hash values of CSAM, they do not collect detailed information on victims and, therefore, 
could not help us answer our primary research question. The summary data they provided us categorises 
material into five areas: 
 Child notable – abuse imagery depicting visually prepubescent children, 
 Age difficult – abuse imagery depicting post-pubescent victims still believed to be under 18 years of 
age, 
 Child erotic – imagery depicting nude children not considered to be a lewd display, and 
 Child cartoon erotic–cartoon images produced to show children (or children characters) in sexual 
situations. ECPAT International

01 INTRODUCTION
Digital information technologies and social 
media platforms have become important 
means of communication used by UNICEF 
and its partners. The physical distancing 
requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic 
have further strengthened reliance on mass 
media, social media and mobile technology as 
a way of reaching and engaging with intended 
audiences. Even where access to digital 
resources remains limited, country programmes 
are launching innovative approaches to 
continue social and behaviour change 
activities despite the physical distancing 
challenge, combining new and more traditional communication methods. This guidance note 
is designed to support country programmes to 
conduct quality, evidence-based, meaningful 
and measurable engagement for prevention 
of harmful practices programming, even when 
interpersonal communication is not possible. In 
particular, this note will:
	nOutline commonly used digital 
communications resources and their 
functions
	nProvide insights into information that can 
help design and/or refine behavioural 
and social norms programming for digital 
approaches
	nHighlight a series of tips for conducting 
effective digital engagement activities
	nOutline complementary channels to 
enhance the reach of digital approachesThe physical 
distancing 
requirements 
during the COVID-19 
pandemic have further 
strengthened reliance 
on mass media, 
social media and 
mobile technology  
as a way of reaching 
and engaging with 
intended audiences.

02 DIGITAL COMMUNICATION 
RESOURCES BY FUNCTION1
With continual advances in the digital sphere, 
more options emerge for engaging remotely 
with intended audiences. Table 1 aims to give 
readers an overview of commonly used digital 
platforms and the functions they can perform. 
A more detailed description of each platform 
can be found in Appendix 1.The choice of digital engagement option(s) 
will depend on the country context and 
communication ecosystem. Developing 
a plan for digital engagement requires an 
understanding of the social, political and 
economic context, as these often define 
access and use of digital resources by intended 
audiences. Mapping the digital landscape, 
including identifying channels, resources and 
communication spaces, as well as identifying 
communities with limited access to digital 
and media channels, can help define a 
comprehensive strategy, where digital and 
traditional approaches intersect to ensure 
greater reach.
Table 1 provides a list of remote mobile 
and digital engagement options, noting the 
requirements for implementing them and their 
suitability for two-way communication. This 
information is intended to help programmes 
identify the most suitable approaches for their 
individual context. Even where 
access 
to digital 
resources remains 
limited, country 
programmes are 
launching innova -
tive approaches 
to continue social 
and behaviour 
change activities 
despite the physical 
distancing challenge.
TABLE 1: FUNCTION
FUNCTION BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF POSSIBLE USES 
Gather social data • Polling and surveys, such as RapidPro, U-Report, GeoPoll, IPSOS ODK/Ona/Kobo, and Viamo, can be used to quickly assess 
important elements such as knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, perceived expectations, intention and behaviours of communities 
regarding harmful practices.
• These tools can also be used to identify information gaps.
• Tools that provide data visualization options, such as Magicbox and Power BI, can help better present information to facilitate 
evidence-based decision making by packaging feedback to allow for real time monitoring.
Share information and 
promote services• Messages around harmful practices can be disseminated across UNICEF, Government and partners’ websites and social media 
platforms, mass media and mobile networks.
• These platforms can also be used to advise the public of available services, including trusted information sources and helplines.
Facilitate dialogue 
and engagement with 
intended audiences• Digital platforms can be used to facilitate two-way communication and dialogue with intended audiences (e.g. adolescents, parents, 
influencers, service providers).
• RapidPro platforms can support and set up additional tools such as the Internet of Good Things (IOGT), Chatbots, U-Report and 
Viamo to provide an interactive space for dialogue and engagement around specific content.
• Selection of the appropriate platform will depend on the needs, infrastructure, capacities of intended users and context.
• Social media and messaging platforms such as Viber, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Facebook groups, as well simpler SMS 
technology, can be used to disseminate correct information and solicit feedback.
• Interactive Voice Response (IVR), such as Viamo, Echo, and Orange Voice Pro, can be effective in low literacy settings to share 
information and solicit feedback.
Support training and 
capacity building• Existing digital platforms and resources can be used to support key workers, by sharing essential information and training packages, 
providing them with resources and digital solutions to enhance their reach to intended audiences.
• Remote training and virtual instruction can be provided to community and faith leaders, mobilisers, mentors and peer educators 
through platforms such as RapidPro, Chatbots, U-Report, the Internet of Good things, and Viamo.
Tracking and addressing 
sentiment and 
misinformation• Digital engagement resources, such as call-centres, social media platforms, and digital engagement solutions, can be harnessed to 
gather information on the dominant sentiment about a given topic (e.g. harmful practices, COVID-19, education, gender).
• Social mobilizers, peer educators, mentors and partners can be capacitated as users of social media to conduct social listening and 
to track and address misinformation.
• Social media platforms can be used to promote referral to trusted sources of information and services.

03 DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT 
AND HARMFUL PRACTICES 
IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 
COVID-19 PANDEMIC
When it comes to harmful practices and 
the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important 
to recognize how the pandemic and the 
restrictions imposed are affecting people’s 
behaviours, including those related to harmful 
practices. For instance, there is evidence that 
in parts of the world, child marriage is on 
the rise as families try to cope with financial 
burdens brought about by the pandemic, while 
in some communities, the female genital 
mutilation (FGM) season is being anticipated 
to take advantage of schools’ closure and 
disruption in protection systems. 
Programmes need to devise ways to keep 
abreast of how the pandemic is affecting 
people’s thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, feelings, 
motivation and intention around FGM and 
child marriage. Such information, as well as 
information on the communication landscape 
and available digital options, can be gathered 
via a rapid desk review and rapid assessments. 
Together, these will shed light on important 
elements for behaviour and social norms 
change programming, such as identifying 
key audiences and influencers, which may 
have changed as a result of the pandemic, determining appropriate channels to reach them 
both on and off-line, and tailoring messages 
and content to the new situation.
GATHERING INFORMATION TO HELP 
DESIGN AND REFINE BEHAVIOUR AND 
SOCIAL NORMS PROGRAMMING 
A rapid desk review should look at media 
habits of intended audiences, trusted and 
utilized information sources, and credible 
spokespersons. In exploring digital media habits, 
remember to look at mobile device ownership 
and access (noting the distribution of smart 
phones versus low-end devices, such as feature 
phones), network strength, availability, speed, 
popular data packages and utilization of any 
low-bandwidth applications, such as Facebook 
Lite, or applications that are available free of 
data charges through Mobile Network Operator 
partnerships, such as Free Basics by Facebook .
A. RAPID ASSESSMENT AND SURVEYS 
These will give you insights into if and how 
people’s perceptions, attitudes, intentions and 
intended behaviours are changing. Assessments 
should be conducted both with your intended 
audiences as determined by the desk review 
(girls, boys, women, parents, and other relevant 
community members), and with key stakeholders, 
such as community and faith leaders, current 
and former excisors, social workers, women 
and youth leaders, and other individuals who 
are likely to have a good understanding of how

Consider conducting the assessment at regular 
intervals (every 2 to 3 months) during the 
pandemic to monitor any changes and adapt 
interventions accordingly.
B. REMOTE SURVEY OPTIONS 
These will be necessary when physical distancing 
measures are in place. Table 1 provides a list of 
possible options of commonly used applications. 
You can find an example of how IVR has been 
successfully used in Ghana to assess media 
exposure and behavioural determinants in this 
monitoring and evaluation note .
Wherever possible, prioritize solutions that 
do not require data bundles in order to reach 
the widest audiences. IVR, USSD and SMS 
(via RapidPro or other solutions) are generally 
preferred to social media applications such as 
WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook Messenger. For 
ideas on how to conduct remote assessments, 
you can refer to this summary of methodologies 
in the era of social distancing  and review  this 
guidance on SMS and IVR surveys . 
You should also be aware that, while digital and 
mobile platforms allow you to gather data, they 
remain inaccessible to many. You can refer to 
Box 1 for some considerations on how to keep 
your surveys inclusive. 
To capture information that can help shape your 
behaviour and social norms change programme 
and integration of digtial compoments, your 
surveys should aim to ask questions that shed 
light on the following three areas:PRACTICES, BEHAVIOURS  
AND DRIVERS:
	nIf and how the prevalence of harmful 
practices is changing during the pandemic
	nWhat families think and feel about engaging 
in harmful practices during the pandemic
	nWho engages in the harmful practices 
	nWho, in the household, decides if the girl 
marries and/or undergoes FGM
	nWhy respondents think it is important (if at 
all) to engage in harmful practices at this time
	nWhether families/respondents intend to 
engage in the practice now  
NORMS:
	nWhether respondents believe/think that a 
majority of community members will engage 
in harmful practices during the pandemic 
	nWhether respondents believe/think they are 
expected to engage in the harmful practices 
at this time by those who matter to them  
INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION  
AND SOCIAL NETWORKS:
	nHow respondents employ their time during 
periods of confinement
	nThe people respondents communicate/
engage with regularly in these times
	nThe spokespersons who are most trusted 
in the community/among your intended 
audiences
	nThe trusted and utilized sources of 
information in these times, especially 
around harmful practices 
BOX 1: CONSIDERATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE REMOTE ASSESSMENTS 
Wherever possible, prioritize solutions that do not require 
data bundles in order to reach the widest audiences. 
IVR, USSD and SMS (via RapidPro or other solutions) are 
generally preferred to social media applications such as 
WhatsApp, Viber and Facebook Messenger.
Where access to mobile phones is limited, ask local 
leaders to conduct the assessments with community 
members. They can do this by using tablets provided by 
your organization or paper-based questionnaires that can 
then be collated by the programme. 
Local leaders can also help people with impairments to 
complete the survey. Encourage them to approach people with disabilities in their community so that their views 
are also reflected in your assessments. 
Where lockdown orders do not allow for direct 
interactions, try to include the views of the most 
marginalized by asking questions about their needs to 
groups and leaders who represent them.
Translate the questionnaires and assessments in relevant 
languages, paying particular attention to the languages 
spoken by women and by vulnerable and remote 
communities.

Information gathered from these rapid 
assessments will provide insights into how the 
pandemic is affecting people’s engagement 
with harmful practices, and help you shape and 
adapt your programme and digital engagement 
activities accordingly.TIPS FOR CONDUCTING EFFECTIVE 
DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT
Digital and online modes of engagement 
allow users to connect virtually, share content 
and ideas, and engage in discussions with 
unprecedented reach, usability and immediacy. 
They represent a channel that can complement 
and enhance communication interventions 
for behaviour and social change. The 14 tips 
summarized in Box 2 will help you make the 
most of your digital approaches, ensuring they 
are evidence-based and promote meaningful 
engagement with intended audiences.
1LINK YOUR DIGITAL EFFORTS TO  
YOUR PROGRAMME’S THEORY OF 
CHANGE: When you devise your programme’s 
theory of change, you need to consider 
behavioural determinants beyond the individual 
level, and include contextual, environmental 
and inter-personal factors too. Your digital 
approaches should align to your existing 
theory of change and reflect the findings from 
the desk review and rapid assessments 
described above. You can find links to 
behavioural theories in the reference section 
at the end of this note.
2TAILOR ACTIVITIES TO YOUR  
INTENDED AUDIENCES’ HABITS AND 
PREFERENCES:  It is crucial that you meet your 
intended audiences where they are. For this, 
you will need to understand their media and 
technology access and use, including 
information about devices, channels, media 
sources, influencers, popular data packages,

COVID-19: DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE 7network strength, and other elements that are 
related to whether and how they access and 
use digital devices, programmes and 
platforms. The assessments described above 
will shed light on many of these areas. 
3REACH BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS:   
To address norms within the community 
as a whole, your digital interventions should 
not exclusively focus on girls. Gender norms 
interventions for example, should also engage 
boys and men. You can see an example of 
how men have been engaged against harmful 
practices in Box 3 and refer to UNFPA’s and 
UNICEF’s  technical note on partnering with 
men and boys to end child marriage in the 
Global Programme to End Child Marriage  for 
more information on this topic. 
4PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUR 
AUDIENCES TO INTERACT WITH YOUR 
DIGITAL CONTENT : Digital interventions can 
be designed flexibly to include interactive 
components (two-way communication), 
opportunities for feedback, and timed 
messaging to engage users in targeted ways. 
Build-in opportunities for engagement such as 
closed discussion groups, virtual counselling, 
testimonials, challenges and feedback, that 
are adapted to the needs, and digital media 
habits of your different audience segments. 
For examples of innovative digital engagement 
you can read about mobile-phone based 
hygiene and sanitation promotion in Somalia , 
and the use of how adolescent girls in 
Mozambique are empowered through SMS 
Biz. Co-creating activities with your intended 
users is an effective way of engaging them 
while ensuring that your activities resonate 
with them. You can provide opportunities for 
them to input into the design process, either 
virtually or in person through workshops or sprint design events. For a practical example 
of how to co-create with your audience, read 
here  about how UNICEF Latin America and 
the Caribbean Regional Office co-created 
UPSHIFT with adolescents, a programme 
aimed and empowering young people to 
become social innovators and entrepreneurs 
through leading approaches in youth 
development and private sector tools. 
5BUILD TRUST AND USE CREDIBLE 
CHAMPIONS:  The use of trusted and 
credible influencers, spokespersons and 
champions is a well-established practice in the 
field of social and behaviour change, including 
within the digital sphere. Select your 
spokespersons based on the findings from your 
initial assessments, and test whether they 
really are credible, popular influencers that 
resonate with your intended audiences and 
your programme. Examples of such champions 
include, national and local celebrities, political 
figures, government agencies, international or 
national/local non-governmental organizations, 
and even fictional characters developed 
exclusively for your intervention.
6DEVELOP ENGAGING, CONCISE 
CONTENT: The content you develop 
should command attention and encourage 
users to engage with it. For this, it needs to 
be appealing and concise. Use an eye-catching 
headline of no more than eight words 
(suggested number of words for highest 
click-rate) and pre-package your content so 
that it is easily sharable. When using images 
remember that low-end devices have a low 
screen resolution and digital images should 
therefore not include text in them. Text should 
be formatted around the images. This will also 
increase the application opportunities of 
content across platforms.The use of 
trusted and 
credible 
influencers, 
spokespersons 
and champions is a 
well-established 
practice in the 
field of social and 
behaviour change, 
including within 
the digital sphere. BOX 3: ENGAGING MEN FOR THE ELIMINATION OF HARMFUL PRACTICES
In Senegal, UNICEF’s supported programme, used a 
combination of education and social mobilization to 
empower women and communities to reduce FGM 
and child marriage. The strategic approach involved 
seeking the buy-in of male village leaders, employ local 
facilitators to teach education sessions, tap into local 
communication channels and use community dialogue 
with both men and women. The programme purposely 
targeted men to enlist their support and mobilized male community and religious leaders, as well as 
engaging women and girls, in an effort to ensure that 
abandoning FGM was a collective and explicit decision, 
involving a whole-community approach. Evaluation 
results from the male engagement component of this 
work showed positive changes in knowledge, attitudes 
and behaviours, which ultimately led to a public 
declaration against FGM and early marriage, as well as 
a slight reduction in child marriages.
COVID-19: DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE87PRE-TEST YOUR CONCEPTS: Factor in 
time and money to pre-test your concepts 
with your intended audiences to ensure they 
resonate and are received and understood the 
way you expect them to be. For guidance on 
pre-testing, you can refer to this pre-testing 
guide  developed by UNICEF during the 
COVID-19 pandemic . Try to personalize data 
and feeds based on your users’ characteristics 
generated from click-data research that indicate 
the type of content they are more likely to 
engage with.
(To learn more about this, see this story from 
UNICEF Senegal on rural outreach on health 
and human rights: https://www.unicef.org/
infobycountry/senegal_53695.html ) 
8THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT LANGUAGE 
AND LITERACY: Assess the level of 
literacy of your intended audiences to 
determine how to engage with them digitally 
and what language and terms to use. Where 
literacy levels are low, IVR and audiovisuals 
may be more appropriate. Ensure that your 
content is available in relevant languages and 
remember that language can also be a 
politicizing factor in some contexts. 9FACTOR IN COSTS AND DATA 
LIMITATIONS:  For greater and more 
equitable reach and utilization of your digital 
platforms, explore how to minimize data 
consumption. Your programmes should be 
cognizant that a portion of your audience 
(sometimes the majority) will have limited 
minutes, data and text message allowances. 
Consider also that smartphones often come 
equipped with pre-installed applications (for 
example Facebook Lite), and with free minutes 
available for specific platforms. Knowing the 
common, standard, free applications supported 
by data packages will help you select digital 
channels that are more likely to be accessed by 
your intended users. Web-based solutions 
often have greater potential to reach remote or 
low-income communities than application-
based solutions, as many low-end devices do 
not have access to an application store but 
come with built-in web browsers. 
10BUDGET FOR MODERATION AND 
MANAGEMENT OF CONTENT AND 
COMMENTS:  If your platforms include an 
interactive component (discussion groups, virtual 
sessions, questions and answers etc.), allocate 
the required resources to respond to and 
moderate those activities. Moreover, in recent 
years, online platforms such as Facebook and 
WhatsApp have been increasingly used to spread 
false and misleading information, including during 
the current COVID-19 pandemic. Women and 
girls are especially likely to face harassment 
online, in particular when they speak out on 
gender discrimination or against deep-seated 
cultural and social norms. It is recommended that 
you budget sufficient resources to monitor, 
moderate and manage content within your digital 
communication platforms, looking out for and 
removing any harmful content and comments. If 
your country benefits from U-Report, consider 
engaging existing U-Partners for content 
moderation. Often, these partners are trained in 
comment moderation.
11AVAIL CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO 
ADDITIONAL DEMAND GENERATED:  It is 
likely that your digital activities will generate 
increased demand for services and information. 
Indicate clearly in your online communication 
where users can go and/or call for support, and 
ensure you have the capacity in place to 
respond. Inability to respond to increased 
demand for services will frustrate your 
participants, reduce their trust in your activities © UNICEF/UNI353143/MAWA
COVID-19: DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE 9and drive them away, ultimately making 
behaviour change less likely in the future and 
impacting negatively on your programme goals.
12PUT DIGITAL SAFEGUARDING 
PRACTICES IN PLACE : Digital 
safeguarding covers important dimensions such 
as data privacy and protection, data security and 
how to keep people safe when using digital 
devices and platforms. Determine appropriate 
safeguarding measures for your context and 
chosen platforms. You can find more information 
on this in the Safeguarding Tips and Guidance  
and the UNICEF-supported  Guidance on 
Responsible Data for Children  documents.
13CONSIDER HOW TO ENGAGE WITH 
OFF-LINE USERS THROUGH MOBILE 
TECHNOLOGY: IVR and RapidPro systems allow 
you to engage with off-line users using low-end 
mobile phones. IVR for example, allows people 
to call and leave messages, or to listen to 
pre-recorded messages left by other users. 
Such a system enables information sharing and 
collection of feedback and opinions by 
encouraging intended audiences to call and 
leave a message. These messages can then be 
used to inform mass-media programming (for 
example radio or TV), which in turn encourage 
audiences to call-in and answer or ask 
questions, or provide comments, thus 
generating a continuous dialogue with intended 
audiences. For an example on how IVR 
technology can be used, please refer to Box 4. 14MAKE A PLAN FOR FEEDBACK:  As your 
digital solution inquiries about users’ 
preferences and opinions inform your activities 
and services, make a plan to share feedback 
with your users as often as possible. Inform 
them about how improved information sharing 
services are available to them or how what 
they share will be used. This creates a virtuous 
data cycle, incentivizing your users to share 
more information, more frequently, with greater 
honesty and accuracy.
USING COMPLEMENTARY CHANNELS 
FOR GREATER IMPACT
Despite the extensive reach of digital 
approaches, and their flexible options for 
various degrees of engagement, there is little 
evidence that they will succeed in changing 
behaviours and social and gender norms if used 
in isolation. For effective engagement, digital 
approaches need to be complemented by 
other channels and reinforced through multiple 
media. Even in times of physical distancing, 
interventions should continue to operate across 
levels of the socio-ecological model (SEM). 
Table 3 provides some examples for engaging 
remotely with intended audiences across 
the SEM. Many of the examples listed are 
digital, however some non-digital, remote 
engagement channels are also suggested for 
message reinforcement.
BOX 4:  MESSAGING FOR MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH: 
THE APONJON EXAMPLE FROM BANGLADESH
Aponjon, meaning “dear one” in Bangla, is the Mobile 
Alliance for Maternal Action’s (MAMA) programme 
in Bangladesh aimed at reducing maternal and child 
mortality through mobile communication technology. 
Adaptable, time-sensitive and stage-based information on 
maternal and infant health issues is delivered directly to 
expectant and new mothers through SMS or interactive 
voice response (IVR). Almost 80% of users from rural areas 
selected to receive messages through IVR, indicating the 
popularity of this approach among rural populations. 
Aponjon delivers twice weekly messages that are 
entertaining and educational, formatted in ‘mini-skits’ with 
actors playing out real life scenarios as characters such 
as pregnant women, doctors, husbands and mothers-in-
law. MAMA Bangladesh also created a unique messaging 
service specifically for husbands, to reinforce messages provided to their wives, and encourage their involvement 
in decision-making on pregnancy, birth and infant care.
An evaluation of Aponjon indicated that women 
reporting at least 6 months use of the service were 
approximately 3 times more likely than non-users to 
score high on both maternal healthcare knowledge and 
related practices, such as attending ante-natal care 
visits, taking iron-folic acid during pregnancy, or taking 
vitamin A after delivery. Further, women reporting 
receiving and listening to at least 3 messages per month, 
were almost twice as likely to have a higher knowledge 
score and better related practices for maternal health 
compared to non-users.
(For more information on Aponjon, please refer to this brief by 
the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action (MAMA) .)

marriage.
• Allow for callers to ask or type questions when they reach out to 
hotlines and IVRs.
• Access or develop video games that mimic real life situations 
around the topic of interest where the user must determine the best 
course of action.
• If you use avatars in your games, select them carefully as avatars 
chosen by young people especially have been shown to inspire and 
influence their behaviour and identity offline.
• If you develop an application for your programme, build-in 
engagement opportunities such as quizzes, discussion groups, 
and peer-to-peer support. Encourage continued engagement by 
exploring opportunities to partner with the private sector to provide 
gifts, prizes, vouchers or free data as users interact with the 
activities in the application.Family Choices  is a game that aims 
to enhance the perception of a girl’s 
place in and value to her family, with

Community • Communication 
applications such as 
WhatsApp, Viber or 
Facebook messenger 
groups
• Videos and leaflets at 
places that continue 
to be accessed by 
community members 
such as essential 
shops and services
• Live chats and 
virtual meetings 
with community/
faith leaders and 
other influential 
stakeholders
• Radio and TV 
shows with call-in 
opportunities• Closed groups such as WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook messenger 
can enable two-way communication with key stakeholders such 
as community and religious leaders, women’s groups and other 
relevant civil society organizations. The groups can be used to 
exchange information, continue promoting key messages, organize 
virtual calls to debate issues arising in the community, and 
monitoring if and how the situation is evolving.
• Radio and TV shows can have extensive reach. Build in 
opportunities for interaction with the audience by providing a call-
in number that people can use to ask questions or comment on a 
topic to generate debate and discussion. Where a local radio exists, 
people who do not have access to a phone can be encouraged to 
write their comments and questions and leave them at the radio 
station.
• Megaphones only provide one-way communication; however, they 
can be helpful in informing community members of opportunities to 
engage in activities.
• Videos, leaflets and information boards can be placed strategically 
in places that people continue to access even with confinement 
restrictions. Again, these do not provide two-way communication 
opportunities, but they can help reinforce key messages and desired 
actions, as determined by your initial assessments.Shujaaz  is a multi-media platform

APPROACHESTIPS & CONSIDERATIONS EXAMPLES
Services • Virtual counselling
• Videos and leaflets at 
points of services• You can integrate opportunities in your digital platform for virtual 
one-to-one discussion and counselling with users. This will afford 
deeper discussion to address barriers to change.
• Some essential services will continue to operate even during the 
pandemic. Medical facilities, maternal and child health services, 
the police and other social services are likely to be open. Explore 
opportunities to integrate messages and materials at these points of 
service.
• Some service providers may benefit from learning more about FGM 
and child marriage and may be well placed to advocate for the 
elimination of these practices among their service users. Consider 
options for virtual training to equip them with the necessary skills to 
discuss key messages with their service users. Radio can also be used 
for remote training.Flying Youthhood  was an entirely 
web-based sex education programme

04 MONITORING AND 
EVALUATION
Even in the realm of digital engagement, it 
is important to put in place key metrics that 
allow you to monitor if and how your digital 
engagement activities are contributing to the 
programme goals. Many social media platforms, 
such as Facebook and Twitter, come with 
built-in analytic dashboards. Third-party software 
platforms also exist that can help you monitor 
social media analytics. Both the in-built and 
third-party platforms can track metrics such as 
clicks, likes, tags, shares and reposts. In most 
cases, these metrics give information about 
reach, with little insight into uptake, interest or 
actual changes in attitudes or behaviours. 
Social media sentiment analysis metrics 
go beyond reach to measure user interest 
by grouping together different actions by 
users, such as comments and engagement 
with content and categorizing them as 
negative, neutral or positive. In social norms 
programming this can give a sense of the 
users’ attitudes and feelings about the topic. 
When choosing the metrics for your digital 
activities, consider the following tips:
	nUse few, carefully selected core 
metrics. Define key metrics that can 
help you measure your intervention. 
Understand the user journey and how 
metrics along the way (engagement with 
particular content, journey completion) can 
provide insights into their experience with 
and response to your digital content.
	nMeasure quickly and often.  Digital 
technologies are iterative and fast-
changing, with users accessing and 
interacting with them in constantly evolving 
ways. Short, iterative evaluations at 
regular intervals help you monitor the user 
experience and make prompt, required 
adjustments to your digital content. 
	nExplore ways to investigate impact.  
Find ways to explore how online 
engagement translates into offline 
behaviour. Online surveys, comment 
analysis, and analysis of user-generated 
content can help understand feelings, 
intention, and impact among users. If 
you are conducting regular assessments 
as described at the start of this note, 
add some questions on respondents’ 
engagement with your digital content (for example utilization and recall). 
Coupled with the other questions in 
your assessment, information about 
respondents’ engagement with your 
digital activities can give an indication 
of its contribution towards any changes 
in other metrics measured by the 
assessments (attitude, intention, beliefs, 
feelings). In Nepal, the Rupantaran  
empowerment programme for example, 
has been adapted to run through the radio 
and changes in girls’ knowledge are being 
assessed through random SMS messages 
after each show. 
	nOffline measurement is still important. 
Where possible, supplement your digital 
data with offline approaches such as 
case studies, focus group discussions, 
observations, and other qualitative 
methods. Such assessments help explore 
why and how users engage with your 
digital approaches, and if and how they 
apply what they have learned offline. 
When lockdown measures prevent face-
to-face meetings, and where connectivity 
allows, you can conduct these qualitative 
assessments remotely using online media, 
such as zoom calls, Facebook Messenger, 
and other communication applications.  
RISK COMMUNICATION AND COMMUNITY 
ENGAGEMENT INDICATORS 
As part of its Global Risk Communication and 
Community Engagement (RCCE) response for 
COVID-19, UNICEF has developed three key 
indicators pertaining to digital and traditional 
media that are also included in the global 
Humanitarian Action of Children (HAC) appeal 
and the global Situation Report (SitRep) on 
COVID-19. To align approaches, the three 
RCCE indicators listed below can also help 
in obtaining a sense of how activities around 
harmful practices are progressing:
	nReach: The number of people 
reached through one-way channels of 
communication
	nEngagement: The number of people 
involved in participatory actions
	nFeedback:  The number of people sharing 
their concerns and asking questions/
clarifications for available support services 
to address their needs through established 
feedback mechanisms
For a breakdown on each indicator and how it 
can be adapted to harmful practices, please 
refer to Appendix 2.Media 
analytics 
is the 
practice of analysing 
digital interactions 
on social media 
platforms using 
various forms of 
data.  It can be 
used to track your 
intended audience’s 
opinions and needs 
in relation to your 
topic or practice 
of interest. COVID-19: DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE 13
05 CONSIDERATIONS FOR 
GOING DIGITAL
While digital channels offer potential for 
increased reach and engagement, there are 
also important challenges around equitable 
access. Gender, disability, income, education 
and geography can all affect if and how your 
intended users engage with your digital 
activities. The following questions will help 
you assess the feasibility of including digital 
approaches in your social norms interventions, 
reflect on potential risks, and consider ways 
to reduce exclusion and exacerbation of pre-
existing power imbalances. 
	nCost: Consider the cost of your digital 
programme and assess whether your 
intended audience is able to afford 
engaging with your content. 
	nLiteracy and language: Ensure that 
the digital channel you choose uses the 
language of your intended audience and is in 
an accessible format. Lower literacy levels 
will require more visual and audio content. 
Remember that in some settings, women 
and girls have lower literacy levels than men 
and boys. 
	nTechnology skills: Assess whether your 
intended audience has the technology 
skills and confidence required to 
interact with your content. Consider any 
differences in skills between audience 
segments, for example rural versus urban 
populations, girls/women versus boys/
men, young versus older people, or 
wealthy versus poor. 
	nCultural norms: Reflect on any local 
customs that may limit or prohibit access 
to digital technology and mobile devices. 
In some cases, there may be negative 
cultural reactions to some audience 
segments, particularly girls and women, 
using mobile phones and the internet.  
	nGender digital divide: The gender digital 
divide is rooted in discriminatory social 
and gender norms which affect the ability 
of girls to access and engage with digital 
technologies. In some contexts, girls 
do not have the same access to digital 
technologies or to devices as boys, or 
they may only be able to access a mobile 
device through a male household member. Often, girls and women have limited 
time for media consumption due to high 
volumes of chores. They may also have 
limited opportunities for learning and 
development, which impacts their skills 
and confidence to interact with digital 
content, denying them a voice for sharing 
experiences and speaking out against 
harmful practices. Programmes need 
to reflect on whether including a digital 
component may exclude girls and women 
and further exacerbate gender imbalances.
	nDisability: Consider how accessible 
your digital content is to people with 
impairments. Assess what assistive 
technology is available to make your 
content inclusive. 
	nPhone lines, internet connection 
and electricity supply: Consider the 
available infrastructure, phone lines, and 
connectivity, as well as electricity supply. 
Disparate infrastructure may mean that 
a segment of your audience is unable to 
access your digital programme. 
	nEthical considerations:  The digital age 
has amplified existing risks and, in some 
cases, created new ones. Child abuse, 
exploitation and trafficking online still 
occur, and children are increasingly facing 
a range of other online risks such as 
cyberbullying, hate speech, harassment 
and exposure to unsuitable content. 
It is essential that children are able to 
participate in a safe online environment, 
benefit from safe devices, applications 
and platforms, and have the ability to use 
the internet safely. Ethical considerations 
need to be at the heart of any digital 
engagement strategy to ensure protection 
of young users. Please refer to UNICEF’s 
Policy guide on children and digital 
connectivity . © UNICEF/UNI319830/KANOBANA

A1 DESCRIPTION OF DIGITAL 
PLATFORMS AND TECHNOLOGIES 
AND POTENTIAL USES3
With increased mobile penetration, digital 
engagement is steadily increasing reach  
across the globe. In light of this, country 
programmes will need to revise, strengthen or 
update their strategies to include digital modes 
of communication. Below is a brief menu of 
the main mobile and digital platforms and 
technologies that can be used to support remote 
and virtual engagement with intended audiences. 
Chatbots  are computer programmes designed 
to simulate conversation with human users at 
scale. Programmes can design chatbots, or 
messaging experiences, and deploy them over many communication channels, including  
SMS, Facebook Messenger, U-Report, 
WhatsApp and Viber. 
GeoPoll  is a mobile-based platform that can 
administer remote, mobile-based surveys all over 
the world. Using SMS and voice calls to target 
specific populations it can be used to conduct 
surveys to gather insights into communities’ 
knowledge, perceptions, beliefs, expectations 
and behaviours around harmful practices. 
Google One Box vetted sites (for example 
National Ministries of Gender, Social Welfare, 
Health or Education) can update their website’s 
code base to include an algorithm that, once 
enabled, allows relevant content to appear in a 
featured box during relevant searches. Google 
One Box, through its partnership with UNICEF 
and the Internet of Good Things (IOGT), offers ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
OTHER RCCE RESOURCES AND HARMFUL PRACTICES
Global RCCE efforts have included the development of a 
range of resources and tools to support communication 
and community engagement even with physical distancing 
measures. Many of these resources contain helpful 
information that is also applicable to harmful practices. 
Appendix 3 provides a list of these resources with key 
considerations for FGM and child marriage programming.

source of trusted information for communities 
of interest.
Internet of Good Things (IOGT)  is a 
community engagement and system 
strengthening tool that offers free access 
to mobile-ready, web-based resources 
and applications configured for low-end 
mobile devices. It provides access to free 
educational and life-saving information. 
Currently, the topics and issues available 
on IOGT include harmful practices, such as 
child marriage and FGM, maternal health, 
hygiene, diseases such as Ebola, Polio, 
Cholera and COVID-19, sexual health advice 
for adolescents, Internet safety, positive 
parenting techniques and more. Content 
is delivered to three distinct user groups: 
parents and caregivers, adolescents and 
young people, and frontline workers and 
educators. It includes engagement tools 
such as surveys and polls. In the context of 
physical distancing, IOGT provides access 
to information in hard to reach communities. 
Country programmes interested in using this 
platform should explore whether it is already 
functioning in the country and add relevant 
content on harmful practices.  
MagicBox is UNICEF’s big data platform 
which is involved in measuring the secondary 
effects of COVID-19 to understand the impacts 
on social behaviour, education, sentiment, 
opinion and vulnerable populations. In addition, 
it provides guidance on how to pinpoint and 
combat misinformation about COVID-19. 
While not strictly related to harmful practices, 
having an awareness of how communities 
are responding can help shape programming 
around harmful practices as well.
RapidPro  is a digital messaging platform that 
powers programmes such as the Internet of 
Good Things, U-Report and Chatbots. It allows 
programmes to develop messages that can 
be disseminated to specific groups, while also 
collecting data via SMS and other channels 
such a voice or social media, to enable real-
time data collection and mass communication 
with intended audiences. RapidPro has 
traditionally been used to support immunization 
campaigns, conditional cash transfer 
programmes and monitoring of public services. 
Messaging can be adapted to address barriers 
and enablers around harmful practices.U-Report  is a digital mobile messaging 
solution that is built on the RapidPro platform. 
It is a social messaging tool and data collection 
system developed by UNICEF to improve 
citizen engagement, inform and foster positive 
change. The programme sends SMS polls and 
alters messaging to its participants, collecting 
real-time responses and subsequently 
publishes the data gathered. 
Viamo  is a simple, low-cost technology 
for data collection and for the provision of 
public information via mobile phones. In 
countries where Viamo is present, it can 
provide information to the general population 
or selected audiences, provide training to 
mobilizers, leaders
 and others, and conduct survey and polls 
to monitor general sentiment, attitudes and 
expectations around harmful practices. 
A2 GLOBAL RCCE INDICATORS 
ADAPTED TO HARMFUL 
PRACTICES
UNICEF’s global RCCE response efforts 
include the development of RCCE indicators 
to promote consistency in global, regional and 
country level reporting on RCCE indicators 
pertaining to digital and traditional media. 
These indicators are included in the global 
Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal 
and the global Situation Report (SitRep)  
on COVID-19. The three following indicators 
are proposed: 
	nReach:  the number of people 
reached through one-way channels of 
communication
	nEngagement:  the number of people 
involved in participatory actions
	nFeedback: the number of people sharing 
their concerns and asking questions/
clarifications for available support services 
to address their needs through established 
feedback mechanisms.
To promote alignment with these global 
indicators, the tables below provides the 
breakdown and description of each indicator. 
It is a slightly revised version of the ‘UNICEF 
Guidance for Country Offices on RCCE 
Indicators for COVID-19 Global Response’ to 
indicate application of indicators in the context 
of harmful practices programming.MagicBox 
is UNICEF’s 
big data 
platform which

and vulnerable 
populations.COVID-19: DIGITAL AND REMOTE APPROACHES IN ELIMINATING FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION AND CHILD MARRIAGE 16TABLE 4: INDICATOR 1: NUMBER OF PEOPLE REACHED
SUPPORTING 
PLATFORMINDICATORS, DEFINITION AND RATIONAL TOOLS
Social media Indicator:  The number of impressions per post (on content relating harmful 
practices).
Definition:  While the exact definition of an impression varies among different 
social media platforms it can be defined as the number of times your content 
enters a person’s screen.
• Facebook:  organic impressions  are the number of times any content from your 
page or about your page entered a person’s screen. Facebook paid impressions  
measure how often your ads were on screen for your target audience.
• Instagram: Impressions measure the total number of times users saw your 
post or story.
• Twitter:  Impressions are defined as any time a Twitter user sees one of your 
tweets.
• LinkedIn:  Impressions are the number of times the updates were shown to 
members.
• For any other social media networks, please refer to their specific definitions.
Calculation:  Select your top performing social media channel (e.g. Facebook) and 
identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the reporting period. For these 
posts, take the total number of impressions and divide by the number of posts.
Rationale: On social media, reach and impressions are related concepts that can 
indicate exposure to messaging. Prioritizing impressions is recommended as this 
is a standard, easily accessible metric across most major social media platforms.Native analytics for 
each social media 
platform (e.g. Facebook, 
Twitter Analytics, 
Instagram Insights etc.)
Web Indicator: The number of unique pageviews for content related to harmful practices.
Definition: Aggregate number of unique views to the programme’s harmful 
practices web pages generated by the same user in the same session during the 
reporting period, i.e. the number of sessions during which the page was viewed, 
one or more times, within a 24 hour period.
Rationale: The number of unique pageviews is an indication of how many 
times messages related to harmful practices on UNICEF or partner webpages 
are viewed. It also helps to identify which posts/pages are most popular to help 
shape future content strategies. This is an easily available metric that can be 
aggregated across relevant web pages relating to harmful practices.
Considerations: The number of unique pageviews is a simple approach that is 
easily accessible to most country offices across different skill levels and capacity 
using Google Analytics. Alternatively, countries can choose to report on ‘# of 
users for specific harmful practices pages’ if they have the capacity to configure 
Google Analytics to limit this data to specific pages.Google Analytics
TV and radio Indicator: The number of people reached through TV and/or radio.
Definition:  Maximum potential reach from radio and TV content on harmful 
practices (e.g. spots, news broadcasts, radio shows).
Rationale: This aligns with the broader RCCE guidance on mass media channels.Use data provided on 
viewership,
listenership, etc. by the 
broadcaster, a media 
monitoring agency, or 
similar sources.
Print and online 
newsIndicator:  The number of people reached through print/online news.
Definition: Maximum potential reach for print/online news. Use the highest 
number of:
• print publications:  use the circulation number
• online news:  use the average number of monthly visitors
Rationale:  This aligns with the broader RCCE guidance on using audience size.Media monitoring

RapidPro-
enabled 
programmes 
(includes 
U-Report, 1000 
days, chatbots,

practices
Definition:  An aggregation of
• Total number of times users were sent at least one message in a RapidPro 
flow on harmful practices, and
• Total number of times users’ questions were answered via Case-Pro/U-Partners, and
• Total number of users reached/times users were reached through other 
RapidPro activities (e.g. via RapidPro API).
Rationale: The number of messages sent by RapidPro-enabled programmes 
gives a reasonably accurate representation of receipt of content. Measuring 
unique users that receive messages in a specific time period is a more difficult 
metric to collect manually.
Considerations: Not all outgoing messages are viewed, and for some channels 
there is no reporting on message delivery (e.g. SMS). This is the best possible 
indicator at this time given current data access. A RapidPro “user” is a single 
contact record, which in most cases represents a single SMS number, Facebook 
account, WhatsApp number, etc. A single person may create more than one 
“user” in RapidPro, but analysis showed this to be infrequent (3% of users).Rapid-Pro, Case-Pro/U-

Internet of 
Good ThingsIndicator: The number of site visitors who access relevant content on IOGT
Definition: Number of users accessing pages tagged for harmful practices and 
related content.
Rationale:  A “site visitor” represents a single person that may access multiple 
articles or messages on harmful practices on the IOGT site. This indicator, is 
defined by Google Analytics as “user,” tracks “site visitors” by IP address, that 
ensures no double-counting occurs of the same person visiting multiple sites.Google Data Studio 
Dashboard
Other digital 
toolsIndicator:  Can be adapted from some of the suggested indicators above.
Rationale:  Offices may employ additional digital tools, such as Viamo or 
CommCare, to reach target populations with information and messages. When 
measuring the reach of messages with these tools, reporting should focus on 
capturing the number of unique  users reached.
Ignored prompts do not qualify for reach reporting but can be used to inform 
programmatic decision making around priority messages and audience 
preferences. Effort should be made, where possible, to disaggregate reach by 
audience type (i.e. gender, age, location, profession).TABLE 4: INDICATOR 1: NUMBER OF PEOPLE REACHED  (continued)

SUPPORTING 
PLATFORMINDICATORS, DEFINITION & RATIONAL TOOLS
Social media Indicator: The number of engagements per relevant post on your top 
performing channel.
Definition: Publicly visible engagements including likes, reactions, 
comments, replies and shares/retweets.
Calculation: Select your top performing social media channel (e.g. 
Facebook) and identify all posts relating to harmful practices during the 
reporting period. For these posts, take the total number of engagements 
and divide by the number of posts.
Rationale:  Due to the limitations of existing tools, there is no simple, 
accurate way to convert the number of engagements to the number of 
people engaged. Accordingly, this metric aims to give an indication of 
the number of people engaged through social media while reducing the 
potential for double counting. Public engagements indicate support and 
interest in your content, and they are also more easily comparable across 
different platforms. Dividing the total number of engagements by the 
number of posts reduces the risk of double counting. Focusing on your top 
performing channel simplifies this process.
Considerations: To simplify data collection across different platforms, 
country offices can use tools that aggregate engagements into a single 
dashboard.Native analytics (e.g. Facebook 
Insights, Twitter Analytics, etc.)
Country offices can use tools 
that aggregate results across 
accounts such as: Talkwalker, 
Social Bakers, Hootsuite, Fan 
Page Karma, or similar.
Web Indicator: Average time on page for relevant content relating to harmful 
practices.
Definition: Average amount of time all users spend on pages relating to 
harmful practices.
Rationale: Average time on page is an indication of how long users 
spend on a webpage before clicking to another page. A longer duration 
can indicate that users are finding the content interesting or informative. 
Please note that using ‘% of returning visitors’ is not recommended as the 
Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) may affect the accuracy of data.Google Analytics
TV and radio Indicator: The number of people engaged through interactive radio and 
TV platforms/programmes (especially community radio).
Definition: The number of people who call-in via interactive TV/radio 
programmes.Varies by platform. May 
be reported by the station, 
broadcaster or digital tools.
Print and online 
newsN/A – not likely relevant N/A
RapidPro-
enabled 
programmes 
(includes 
U-Report, 1000 
days, chatbots,

that have incorporated content on harmful practices.
Definition:
• The number of messages received from users on RapidPro flows on 
harmful practices
• The number of messages received from users on CasePro/U-Partners 
platforms
• The number of messages received from users through other RapidPro 
activities (e.g. via RapidPro API).
Rationale: The number of messages received from a user in a message 
service relating to harmful practices is the strongest indicator of the 
level of engagement with your content. This is also comparable across 
different messaging platforms and accounts for the digital messaging 
channel modality, where due to length restrictions (e.g. length of SMS) 
content is often broken up across a series of messages.RapidPro, CasePro/U-

PLATFORMINDICATORS, DEFINITION & RATIONAL TOOLS
Internet of 
Good ThingsIndicator:  The number of poll, survey and question responses and 
comments posted relating to harmful practices.
Definition:  Responses or comments represent the engagement with 
a single user. Aggregate the number of polls, survey and open-ended 
question responses relating to harmful practices that are submitted on 
the IOGT site, added with the total number of comments  posted across 
articles relating to harmful practices that do not violate community terms 
and conditions.
Rationale:  IOGT has four opportunities for users to engage with  
the platform:
1. Polls
2. Surveys
3. Open-ended questions
4. Comments on the page
Considerations: Poll participation requires the user to login to the 
website, and is therefore infrequently used, but represents the most 
engaged response a user can initiate. Comments, surveys, and open-ended 
questions can be configured to allow anonymous responses and therefore 
tend to have more engagement. This data cannot be successfully pulled 
from Google Analytics and requires login to the Content Management 
System of your IOGT site in order to access and aggregate total reporting.Google Data Studio Dashboard
Other digital 
toolsIndicator Guidance: Can be adapted from some of the suggested 
indicators above.
Rationale: Offices may employ additional digital tools, such as Viamo or 
CommCare, to engage target populations on actions relating to harmful 
practices. When measuring engagement through these tools, reporting 
should capture the number of unique, two-way user engagements 
completed  (without regard to the number of unique users).
Consideration: Two-way communication through a digital tool is 
defined as any time user feedback is solicited by the tool and responded 
to by the user.

you may report relevant results here. Otherwise, you may consider other 
available mechanisms such as hotlines, radio call-in shows or U-Report.U-Report, hotlines, radio call-

Other digital 
toolsIndicators: These can be adapted from the suggested indicators above.
Rationale: Offices may employ additional digital tools, such as Viamo or 
other established platforms deployed specifically as feedback mechanisms. 
When reporting on additional digital tools, this indicator should capture the 
number of unique users who share personal stories and opinions relating 
to harmful practices or who request, via a workflow-based engagement or 
open-ended response, information or support on harmful practices.
Consideration: Two-way communication through a digital tool is 
defined as any time user feedback is solicited by the tool and responded 
to by the user.TABLE 5:  INDICATOR 2: NUMBER OF PEOPLE INVOL VED

 Highlights  
 This is the first study to prospectively examine the associations between digital media use 
and subsequent self -harm in a large sample of Chinese adolescents.  
 Our findings demonstrate that excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be a 
significant risk factor of self -harm.  
 Watching TV at baseline was not independently associated with subsequent self -harm.  
 Our study suggests that  limiting adolescent use of digital media  may be beneficial to 
reduce risk of self -harm.

 Abstract  
Background : Excessive digital media use is prevalent and has a negative impact on sleep, 
daytime functioning, and mental health in adolescents. We examine d the prospective 
associations  between digital media use and subsequent suicidal and non -suicidal self -harm . 
Methods:  Shandong Adolescent B ehavior & Health Cohort  (SABHC)  is a longitudinal study of 
adolescent behavior and health in Shandong, China . Participants included for the analysis were 
7,072  SABHC adolescents  who were initially assessed in 2015 and were reassessed in 2016. A  
self-administered structured questionnaire was used to measure digital media use  (i.e., television 
watching, internet use, and mobile phone use ) on weekdays and at the weekend , mental heal th, 
and self -harm.   
Results : Multi variable  logistic regression analyses s howed that daily internet use ≥ 2 hours on 
weekdays ( odd ratio ( OR)=1.86, 95%  confidence interval (CI)=1.25 -2.76)  and ≥3 hours at the 
weekend (OR= 1.46, 95%CI =1.06 -2.00) and daily mobile phone use 2-4 hours at the weekend 
(OR=1.46, 95%CI =1.02 -2.10) were associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm . Daily 
internet use ≥ 2 hours on weekdays (OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.20 -2.74) and ≥3 hours at the weekend 
(OR=1.55, 95%CI=1.12 -2.15), daily mobile phone use 1 -2 hours on weekdays (OR=1.47, 
95%CI =1.02 -2.12) and ≥4 hours at the weekend (OR=1.93, 95%CI =1.31 -2.85) were  associated 
with increased risk of recurrent non-suicidal self -injury .  
Limitations:  All data were  self-reported  and had no information about  digital media 
consumption.   
Conclusions : Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be a significant risk factor of 
self-harm , suggesting that  limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be beneficial 
to reduce risk of self -harm.

 1. Introduction  
Self-harm refers to intentional self -poisoning or self -injury, irrespective of type of motive 
or the extent of suicidal intent  (Hawton et al.,  2003 ), including suicide  attempt  and non-suicidal 
self-injury  (NSSI) . Self-harm among you th is prevalent , with  2% to 15% of adolescents having 
attempted suicide or afflicted self-harm (Hawton et al, 2012, Kann  et al., 2016, Liu et al., 201 9). 
Although most self-harms  are low in lethality, they are associated with clinical and functional 
impairment s and are a significant predictor of future s elf-harm and suicide  (Gould  et al., 2003 , 
Hawton et al., 2012) . It is therefore essential to identify modifiable risk factors  to develop 
effective intervention programs for youth self -harm prevention.  
In the modern society, digital media transmitted over the internet, computer network , 
mobile/ smart phone, tablet , and /or television ( TV) has become an essential source f or 
communication, socialization and education. Internet use in the world has increased considerably 
over the past few decades , especially among youth  (Kaess  et al., 2014) . According to Per 
Research Center, 92% of teens in the U.S. report going  online daily - including 24% who say 
they go online ―almost constantly ‖ (Lenhart  et al., 2010) . Digital media use has a mixed effect on 
pediatric population ’s well -being, with evidence of increased self -esteem and perceived social 
support alongside harmful effects such as increased exposure to graphic content, cyber -bullying, 
and risk of developing online addictive behaviors  (Best et al., 2014 ; Kaess  et al., 2014, Tonioni  
et al., 2012) . Excessive digital media use may have a detrimental impact on adolescents’ 
psychosocial development  and mental health  (Kaess  et al., 2014) , school performance (Liu et al., 
2020), sleep disturbances, and multiple risk -taking behaviors such as disordered eating  and 
substance abuse  (Levenson  et al., 2016, Park et al., 2018) . High profile cases of cyber -bullying 
and suicide over the past decade (L ester et al., 2013) and reports of suicide clusters facilitated by 
         
         8 
 social media ( Robertson et al., 2012)  have caused an increas ed attention to  better understand  the 
association  between internet use and self -harm /suicide.  
Recent studies have demonstrated significant associations between pathological internet 
use or i nternet addition and self -injury (Lam et al., 2009)  and suicidal behaviors  (Kaess  et al., 
2014, Lin et al., 2014, Marchant  et al., 2017) . It has also been reported that rates of internet use 
were higher among adolescents who self -harm than their peers  who d o not use the internet as 
much  (Daine  et al., 2013) . A study examined the social dynamics surrounding media reporting 
on suicide in a suicide -prone community  (Poplar Grove, USA)  with an enduring adolescent 
suicide  problem  and found that suicide deaths that were covered by digital media triggered 
significant  cognitive dissonance , which may generate opportunities  for peer role modeling of 
suicide  (Mueller , 2017) . Celebrity suicides that generate a large reaction from users on Twitter 
can also increase suicide r isk (Ueda , 2017).  
These findings  suggest that  excessive digital media use may be a significant risk factor of 
self-harm . A recent review  of the association between  social media, internet us e, and suicide 
attempts in adolescent  includes  nine cross -sectional studies published between 2012 and 2018 , 
and concludes  an independent association between problem atic use of social media/internet and 
suicide attempts in young people ( Sedgwick  et al., 2019).  However, to our best knowledge, most 
previous studies are cross -sectional  so that the direction of causality, if any, remains unclear , as 
such further evaluation through longitudinal studies is warranted ; and they have  been focused on 
pathological internet use or internet addiction  (Lam et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2017, Park et al., 
2013) , and their findings are not consisten t. To address th ese limitations , we conducted a 
longitudinal study w ith a large community sample of adolescents in China (n=7,072)  to examine  
the prospective association  between digital media use (television watching, internet use, and 
         
         9 
 mobile phone use ) and subsequent self-harm, including  suicid e attempt  and NSSI over a 1-year 
follow -up. 
 
2. Method  
2.1. Parti cipants and procedure  
Shandong Adolescent Behavior & Health Cohort (SABHC) is a  longitudinal study of 
adolescent behavior and health in Shandong, China. A total of 11,83 1 adolescent students 
participated in SABHC baseline survey . Detailed sampling and data collection have been  
published  elsewhere  (Liu et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2019 ). In brief, participants were sampled from 
5 middle and 3 high schools  in 3 counties of Shan dong  province , with consideration s of 
representativeness of the schools across the counties , prior study collaboration, convenience, and 
budget for at least 3 waves of data collection. The study was approved by the research ethics 
committee of School of Public Health at Shandong University , China . We obtained permission to 
conduct the study from all the target schools  and informed consent from participants before 
baseline survey.  
Figure 1 shows SABHC study flow chart. The b aseline survey was conducted amongst  7-
11th graders in Nov ember -December  of 2015  (n=11,831 ) (Liu et al, 2017, Liu et al., 2018 , Liu et 
al., 2019 ). A self-administered, structured adolescent health questionnaire (AHQ)  was used to  
assess suicid e attempt , NSSI, mental health, digital media use, and psychosocial factors  (Chen  et 
al., 2017, Liu, 2004, Liu and Tein, 2005, Liu et al., 2008). Trained public health workers  or 
master  public health  students administered AHQ to participants in their classrooms during 
regular school hours. Before filling out the questionnaire, participants were instructed to read the 
instructions carefully and were informed that the survey was anonymous, their responses were 
         
         10 
 blind to teachers , and their participation was voluntary without any penalties for nonparticipation.  
It took about 45minutes to complete the survey. All 9th and 11th graders were not followed up 
(n=3,202) because they were preparing for high school and college entrance exams, respectively.  
According to our study design, 7th, 8th, and 10th graders at baseline (n = 8,629) were resurveyed 
one year later in 2016. The final analysis included 7,072 participants who were initially assessed 
in 2015 and were reassessed in 2016.   
 
2.2. Measures  
2.2.1 Self-harm  
Self-harm was assessed using questions about suicide attempt and NSSI. Suicide attempt 
was measured with the question: ―Have you ever tried to kill yourself  in your whole life ?‖ for 
lifetime suicide attempt and ―Did you try to kill yourself  during the past year ?‖ for last -year 
suicide attempt. NSSI was measured with the question: ―Have you ever tried to hurt yourself 
deliberately without intention to kill yourself in your whole life? ‖ for lifetime NSSI and ―Did 
you ever try to hurt yourself deliberately without intention to kill yourself during the past year?‖ 
for last -year NSSI. If a respondent answered ―yes‖ on the question, he or she was considered to 
have the behavior. These questions have been used in our studie s to assess suicidal behav ior and 
NSSI  in Chinese adolescents  (Liu, 2004, Liu et al., 2017).  
  
         
         11 
  
 
2.2.2 Digital media use  
Three types of digital media exposure at baseline were surveyed, including  TV watching, 
internet  use for entertainment or v ideo game playing, and mobile phone use.  Respondents were 
asked the number of  hours per day on weekdays and at the weekend that they had spent using 
each media in the past month , which should be very different in weekdays ( at school) and 
weekdays ( at home ) and may have diff erent effects on sleep  and mental health (Liu et al., 2019).  
The following questions were specifically asked :1)―On an average school day, how many hours 
do you watch TV? ‖, 2)―On an average school day, how many hours do you use the internet  for 
entertainment or video game  playing ?‖, 3)―On an average school day, how many hou rs do you 
use mobile /smart  phone? ‖, 4) ―On an average weekend day, how many hou rs do you watch 
TV?‖, 5) ―On an average weekend day, how many hours do you use the i nternet  for 
entertainment or video game playing ?‖, and 6) ―On an average weekend day, how many  hours 
do you use mobile /smart  phone?‖.  
 
2.2.3 Covariates  
The following covariates were selected in the current study based on  literature  (Hawton 
et al., 2012, Kaess et al., 2014, Liu and Buysse , 2006, Liu et al., 2019) and/or if p-values were 
less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis  for the a ssociation between  digital media use and self -
harm  (Lauw et al., 2018) .  
Anxio us/depressive symptoms. The Chinese Youth Self -Report (YSR)  of Achenbach’s 
Child Behavior Checklist was  used to measure anxious/depressive symptoms  (Achenbach , 1991, 
         
         12 
 Liu et al., 1997) . The YSR anxious/depressed subscale consists of 16 items that are rated on a 3 -
point scale: ―0‖ = not true, ―1‖  = somewhat or sometimes true, and ―2‖ = very true or often true. 
The Cronbach alpha  with the present sample was 0.8 8 for the subscale. For the  present  study, 2 
items concerning s elf-harm were dropped when calculating the subscale  score . 
Impulsiveness . The Eysenck I7 impulsiveness scale was used to assess adolescent’s 
impulsivity  (Eysenck  et al., 1984) . The scale is composed of 19 items with a modified response 
format from 1 = never or rarely , 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, to 4 = always. Example items are ―Do 
you often get into trouble because you do things without thinking?‖ and ―Are you an impulsive 
person?‖ The Cronbach alpha was 0.92 with the current sample.  
Other a dolescent covariates  were age, gender , chronic disease, insomnia symptoms, 
cigarette  smoking , and alcohol  use. 
Family factors included father  education  (primary school, middle school, high school, 
professional school, or college or above) , family history of suicide or attempt, self-reported 
family economic status  (excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor) , and interparental relationship  
(excellent , good, fair, poor, or separated/divorced /died ). 
 
2.3. Statistical analysis  
Based on the history of self-harm at baseline and at 1-year follow -up, participants were 
categorized into 4 groups: never self -harm, baseline self -harm only, recurrent self -harm, and new 
self-harm. Chi-square tests were used to examine the differences in self -harm across digital 
media use (TV, internet , and mobile phone) on weekdays and at the weekend. Univariate and 
multi ple logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the associations between 
individual media use on weekdays and at the weekend and recurrent self -harm and new self -
         
         13 
 harm, respec tively. In the multivaria ble models, covariates were adolescent factors 
(anxious/depressive symptoms, impulsiveness, age, gender, chronic disease, insomnia symptoms, 
cigarette smoking, and alcohol use) and family factors (father education, family history o f 
suicide or attempt, self -reported family economic status and inter -parental relationship).   Primary 
statistical analyses were performed f or self-harm . Secondary analyses were performed for suicide 
attempt and NSSI, respectively . All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics for Windows, Version 2 2.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) .  
 
3. Results  
3.1. Sample characteristics  
Of the 8,629 7th-8th graders and 10th graders  who participated in the baseline survey, 
7,072 (82.0%)  were re survey ed at the 1-year follow -up and were included for the analysis . The 
primary reason for loss to follow -up was that some participants  went to different classes/schools.  
However, b aseline adolescent and family demographic characteristics (including age, gender , 
smoking, drinking, family history of suicid e, father ’s education  and occupation, and family 
economic status ) were similar between participants who were re survey ed and those who were 
expected to be re survey ed (all P> .05) . Of the 7,072 participants, mean age was 14.59 years (SD 
= 1.45) at baseline and half were males.  Table 1 presents detailed sample characteristics at 
baseline.  
 
3.2. Digital media use in Chinese adolescents  
On weekdays, the mean time of digital media use at baseline was 0.45 hours (27 min) /day 
for watching TV, 0.38 hours (23 min) for internet use, and 0.50 hours (30 min) for mobile phone 
         
         14 
 use, respectively. At the weekend, the time of digital media use at baseline substantially 
increased: 2.6 hours (156 min) /day for watching TV, 2.1 hours (126 min) for internet use, and 
2.6 hours (156 min) for mobile phone use. In other words, 20% watch ed TV, 17% used i nternet, 
and used mobile phone  for at least 1 hour /day on weekdays; 64% watch ed TV, 48% used internet, 
and 52% used mobile at least 2 hours/day at the weekend  (Table 1) . 
 
3.3. Self-harm at 1 -year follow -up 
At 1-year follow -up, 10.2% participants engaged in self -harm , with 4.2% for new self -
harm and 6.0% for recurrent self -harm . As shown in Figure 2, the incidence  rates  of new NSSI 
and suicide attempt w ere 3.5% and 2.1%, respectively; and the incidence  rates  of recurrent NSSI 
and suicide attempt w ere 5.2% and 0.6%, respectively.  
 
3.4. Associations between digital media use and self -harm  
Table 2 shows baseline digital media use on weekdays and at the weekend by self-harm. 
On weekday s, internet use and mobile phone use were positively  associated with self -harm (both 
P<0.001). At the weekend, watching TV, internet use, and mobile phone use were all positi vely 
associated with self -harm (all P<0.001).  
Table 3 shows crude and adjusted odds ratios of self-harm at 1-year follow -up associated 
with each digital media use. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that internet use ≥ 2 
hours/day on weekdays (OR=1.86, 95%CI=1.25 -2.76)  and ≥3 hours /day at the weekend (OR 
=1.46, 95%CI =1.06 -2.00), mobile phone use 2 -4 hours /day on weekends (OR =1.46, 95%CI 
=1.02 -2.10) and ≥4 hours/day  at the weekend (OR =1.74, 95%CI =1.20 -2.51) were significantly 
         
         15 
 associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm after adjusting for adolescent and family 
covariates.   
For NSSI, baseline internet use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekdays (OR=1.81, 95%CI=1.20 -2.74)  
and ≥3 hours /day at the weekend (OR = 1.55, 95%CI =1.12 -2.15), mobile phone use 1 -2 
hours /day on weekdays (OR =1.47, 95%CI =1.02 -2.12) and 2 -4 hours /day (OR=1.49, 
95%CI=1.01 -2.19) and ≥4 hours/day  at the weekend (OR =1.93, 95%CI =1.31 -2.85) were 
significantly as sociated with increased risk of recurrent NSSI after adjusting for adolescent and 
family covariates (Table  4).   
For suicide attempt, baseline internet use 1 -2 hours/day on weekdays and 2-3 hours/day 
at the weekend were significantly associated with 1.8-fold increase in risk of new suicide attempt 
(OR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.07 - 3.03) and an approximately  6-fold increase in risk of recurrent 
suicide attempt (OR = 6.26, 95%CI=1.31 -29.88), respectively.  
Watching TV at baseline was not independently associated with either subsequent NSSI 
or suicide attempt . 
 
4. Discussion  
To our knowledge, this is the first study to prospectively examine the association s 
between  digital media use and subsequent  self-harm in a large sample of Chinese adolescents. 
Our major findings are 1) internet use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekdays and ≥ 3 hours at the weekend 
were associated with an increase d risk of recurrent self -harm at 1-year follow -up after adjusting 
for adolescent and family covariates ; 2) mobile phone use ≥ 2 hours/day on weekends were 
associated with increased risk of recurrent self -harm; 3) f or suicide attempt, internet use ≥ 1 
         
         16 
 hours /day on weekdays and ≥ 2 hours/day at the weekend  were associated with increase d risks 
for new suicide attempt  and  recurrent suicide attempt , respectively . 
On average  in 2015,  American  8-12-year-olds spent  4 hours  36 minutes  per day on a 
screen  whilst  13-18-year-olds spent  6 hours  40 minutes  per day on a screen  (Rideout,  2015 ). 
According  to the Royal  College  of Paediatrics  and Child  Health  (2018),  children  and young  
people  from  the UK aged  11-24 years  old on average  spent  2.5 hours  on a computer/  laptop/  
tablet,  3 hours  on their phone , and 2 hours  watching  TV on a typical  day (Viner  and Firth,  2019 ). 
Compared  to Western  adolescents,  the averages  of minutes  of TV, internet  use, and mobile  
phone  use are lower in adolescents  in China , possibly  due to authoritarian  parenting,  health  
homework,  restriction  or limited  permit  of using  mobile  phone  at school  and at home .  
Despite relatively shorter time of digital media use in Chinese adolescents than Western 
peers, our findings support the positive association of self -harm/suicidal behavior with internet 
use, particularly with internet addiction, high levels of internet use, and websites with self -harm 
or suicide content  (Marchant  et al., 2017) . Although the mechanis m between digital media use 
and self -harm is not yet clear, there are several potential explanations. First, excessive digital 
media use and/or internet addiction are associated with mental health problems, such as 
depression, hostility, aggressive behaviors, and ADHD symptoms  (Ko et al., 2009, Lin et al., 
2016, Yen et al., 2007 , Liu et al., 2019 ), all of which can increase risk of self-harm  (Liu et al., 
2005, Liu et al., 201 9). Second, internet use or s ocial media  exposure may cause cyber -bullying  
or peer harassment , leading to depression , decreased self -worth, hopelessness, and loneliness —
all of which are precursors to suicidal behavio r (Hinduja  et al., 2010, John et al., 2018, O'Keeffe  
et al., 2011) . For example, a recent study of cyber -victimizat ion across seven European countries 
found that cyberbullying is linked to higher use of social network sites in adolescents aged 14 -17 
         
         17 
 years (Athanasiou  et al., 2018). In addition, the feeling of lack and dissatisfaction when scrolling 
through newsfeed often results from constant life/success comparisons, e.g., comparing 
individuals’ true reality to their peers idealized (e.g., perfectly Wechat or Instagr amed 
realities).These may result in having devastating consequences including self -harm.   
Third , sleep insufficiency and sleep disturbance have been demonstrated to be associated 
with self -harm  (Liu, 2004, Liu and Buysse, 2006, Liu et al., 2017).  Excessive digital media 
exposure may cause sleep loss and sleep and circadian rhythms disturbance s (Cain and Gradisar, 
2010, Chang et al., 2015, Higuchi et al., 2005).  Fourth , many adolescents may use the internet to 
look for information about sensitive top ics, such as mental health and behavioral problems, safe 
sexual practices, or contraception  and seek help online  (Collins et al., 2011 ; Srivastava et al., 
2018 ). For example, results suggest that there is a substantial amount of sexual content in teen 
chat rooms, both constructed  by teens (names, utterances) and present for teen users to be 
exposed to as observers . Internet sites and activities that resemble chats may include  discussions 
among participants in online video games, posted comments on YouTube, and comments on 
social networking sites  (Collins et al.,  2011) . Research  has shown  that having a sexual screen 
name or talking with peo ple known only online about sex  and using chat rooms were asso ciated 
with higher likelihood of self-harm (Mitchell and Ybarra, 2007).  The content  and veracity of 
information found online can be harmful ( such as information about pain/stress release via self -
harm and how to injure self or suicide)  (Belfort  et al., 2018) . Viewing images and reading 
information about self -harm in digital media can normalize self -harming behavior and 
discourage seeking professional help (Daine  et al., 2013) and lead to physical self -harm and 
suicidal ideation  (Patchin and Hinduja , 2017).  Fifth, recurrent self -harm or new suicide attempts 
can be prompted by viewing self-harm related stories in digital media  (Zahl and Hawton , 2004) .  
         
         18 
 Furthermore, excessive digital media use may cause fatigue and cognitive functioning 
impairment, poor judgement and impulsive behavior , all of which in turn can lead to suicidal and 
non-suicidal self -harm  (de Cates  et al., 2017, Liu et al., 2017).  Further research is warranted to 
examine the psychosocial pathways and biological mechanisms including mediators and 
moderators between digital media use and self -ham in adolescents.  
It is interesting to note that w atching TV was not independently associated with 
subsequent self -harm . This difference may be due to the inherent nature of watching TV  versus 
the use of  internet or smart phones. Watching TV does not require interacting with others, 
whereas using the internet and smart phon es does  (e.g., cyber  bullying,  constant  life/success  
comparisons) . On the other hand, TV programs may be more educational, entertain ing, enjoyable , 
and less violent and sexual  than contents in the internet or website.  
 
4.1 Clinical and public health implications  
In the technologically -driven digital era, the use of digital media will undoubtedly 
continue to rise. In the U .S., 84% of adults and 93% of teens ages 12 -17 have access to the 
Internet, and Facebook is currently the most commonly -used online social network  (Lenhart  et 
al., 2010, Perrin , 2015) . According to the 40th Statistical Report on Internet Development in 
China, the number of Chinese netize ns reached 751 million, mobile Internet users reached 721 
million, and the percentage of Internet surfing via mobile was as high as 96.3%  (CNNIC , 2017). 
Thus, mobile phone is not only used for phone call, but it is more likely used for internet and 
social communication. Although digital media can provide a wealth of information and resources 
that teens  can use to learn, socialize and communicate with peers and maintain their own health, 
digital media also has  a negative impact on teen’s psychosocial development and health  
         
         19 
 (O'Keeffe  et al., 2011).  Our study demonstrates that excessive digital media use w as associated 
with subsequent self -harm. Preventive strategies for self -harm and comprehensive intervention 
programs at school, family, clinical practice, and society levels are warranted. Intervention 
programs should be designed to prevent excessive digit al media use and internet addiction and to 
educate adolescents to avoid unhealthy, violent and sexual information when surfing the internet 
to improve adolescents’ mental health and reduce risk of self -harm. In the pediatric/adolescent 
medicine practice se tting, clinicians should engage in assessment and discussion about internet 
use, especially for adolescents who have engaged in suicidal and non -suicidal self -harm or have 
mental health issues  (Marchant  et al., 2017) . 
 
4.2. Strengths  and limitations  
This study has several strengths. First, this is a longitudinal study to examine the 
prospective association s between digital media use and self-harm  in a large sample of 
adolescents. Second, participants were  sampled from multiple counties and schools (n=8 ) to be 
representative of adolescent student s in the region. Third, the response rate of 82% was 
acceptably high. Fourth, weekday and weekend use of digital media was examined , separately. 
Fifth, multiple adolescent and family variables were statistically controlled for when examining 
the association s between digital media use and self -harm . Furthermore, it is particular ly 
important to examine suicide attempt and NSSI , respectively . 
Despite the strengths of the study, t hese findings need to be interpreted with considering 
the following limitations . First, all data were collected by self -report, which may have led to 
biased reporting of self-harm and digital media use. However, given that many individuals who 
have suicid e attempt s or self -injury may never seek medical help or result in hospitalization, self -
         
         20 
 report ed measures remain a valuable source of information about s elf-harm  (Hawton  et al., 2002, 
Owens  et al., 2015).  Objective measures of digital media use or diary are desirable, but self -
reports remain as the  typical method  in large -scale epidemiologic al studies . Second , data on the 
content of digital media consumption  were not collected . It is not possible to distinguish the 
effects of the contents , such as  cyberbullying, sexting, and self-injury encouraging  that may lead 
to self -harm. Third, internet addiction or pathological internet use is prevalent and is associated 
with mental health problems and suicidal behavior  in adolescents  (Lin et al., 2014, Marchant  et 
al., 2017, Tonioni  et al., 2012).  Although excessive digital media use is a symptom of internet 
addiction, the impact of excessive digital media use and internet addiction on mental health and 
self-harm may be different.  Fourth, although this sample is large , it may not be powerful enough 
for examining the association between digital media use and suicide attempt because the 
incidence of suicide attempt was low. 
 
4.3. Conclusions  
            Excessive use of internet or mobile phone appears to be a significant risk factor of self -
harm. Our study suggests that  limiting adolescent use of internet and mobile phone may be 
beneficial to reduce risk of self -harm.

Background. Advances in information and communication technologies facilitate opportunities for sexual exploitation 
and abuse of children online (SEACO). Despite the presence of laws against child pornography, trafficking, and 
cybercrime, the Philippines has become known as a key hub of the billion-dollar global child cybersex industry. 
Objective. The objective of this study was to provide insight on SEACO in the Philippines.Methods. The methodology consisted of a review of readily available news articles and reports. The search term 
“Philippines cybersex” was used in Advanced Search in Google News (https:/ /news.google.com.ph) for English 
language reports from 1995 to 2015 to describe the geographic distribution of media reported cases of SEACO, the profile of victims and offenders, and how offenders and victims became involved in SEACO.
Results. The review found 55 reports and articles from 2011 to 2015. Cases were reported from 9 regions in the 
country with victims ranging from 18 months to 17 years in age. Three types of SEACO were identified: live streaming 
of child sexual abuse, child sexual abuse material (child pornography), and sextortion using minors. 
Conclusion. Cases of SEACO were found to be present throughout the country. National policies and preventive 
measures are needed to stem this crime.Key Words: child sexual abuse, live-stream child abuse, Philippines, sexual exploitation

Accessibility to information and communication 
technologies (ICTs) has become widespread worldwide. 
At the same time, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation are increasingly taking place through the use of ICTs. While the internet presents opportunities for knowledge and development in children, online risks such as sexual exploitation and abuse of children online (SEACO) also occur. A pilot study conducted 2016 in the Philippines identified exposure to exploitative strangers and cybersex as some of the risks that Filipino children are prone to when they go online. In the study, 114 children aged 9 to 17 years disclosed that all of them have been exposed to cybersex, sexual messages/materials, and sexual grooming in different forms and modes through Facebook, porn websites, group chats, pop up menu, sexual tweets, sexual games, and sexual images sent as a joke. Children also disclosed that they have

305experienced receiving and sending sexual messages in words, 
pictures or videos, commonly known as “sexting.”1 As seen 
in the study, ICTs enable rapid and widespread production, exchange, and distribution of potential child sexual abuse material through social media, newsgroups, email, and/or instant messaging systems. In addition, a UNICEF study revealed that 8 in 10 Filipino children and adolescents are in danger of being bullied or being sexually abused online.
2 
Aside from cyber bullying and sexting, other ICT-facilitated threats to children in the Philippines include exposure to pornography or sexually explicit content; online grooming and sexual solicitation; offline sexual abuse facilitated by the internet and social media; child abuse material (child pornography), and online commercial sexual exploitation of children.
3
The Philippines has become known as a top global 
source of materials on child sexual abuse. More than 20,000 child pornographic images are uploaded to the internet everyweek.
4 In 2005, a random search made by a research 
team found photos of individuals appearing to be aged between 11 and 17 years in various nude poses and sexual acts. They were recognized as Filipinos because of their build, clothing and facial structure.
5 In the same year, a 
paper on cyber trafficking of Filipino girls found evidence of commercial sexual exploitation of Filipino children online.
6
The 2016 Terminology Guidelines for the Protection 
of Children from Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse defines online child sexual abuse in two ways: “sexual abuse of children that is facilitated by ICTs (online-facilitated child sexual abuse)” and “sexual abuse of children that is committed elsewhere and then repeated by sharing it online through, for instance, images and videos.
7 It is also important 
to note that online child sexual exploitation is not a distinct type of sexual exploitation. In this case, the internet is used to exploit children hence online child sexual exploitation is an umbrella term to indicate sexual exploitation with an online component. The online manifestations of child sexual exploitation include: a) child pornography or child abuse material, b) live online child sexual abuse, and c) solicitation of children for sexual purposes.
7
Live streaming of child sexual abuse is a new form of 
child abuse and exploitation enabled by ICTs.8 Currently, 
many live stream child sexual abuse cases have been noted to be on the rise. Live stream child sexual abuse is conducted in a private place (usually a house) organized by an ‘operator’ where children undress and perform sexual acts on each other following instructions from a remote pedophile through a webcam. Money is sent to the ‘operator’ through an international wire transfer as payment for the ‘show’ which lasts from 15 to 30 minutes.
9 Money is sent 
through Western Union or local money-transfer agencies like Cebuana Lhuiller and GCash.
These money transfer methods help identify and trace 
online child sex abusers. Recently, alternative ways like prepaid debit cards and Bitcoins have been used including online money transfer sites such as Xoom and Azimo. These alternative ways of money transfer offer anonymity or false identities for financial transactions and can hinder prosecution of individuals involved.
10 
Poverty is seen to be a key driving force for children 
in becoming victims of online child sexual abuse; other driving forces include a good grasp of the English language, affordable and widespread internet access, the “easy money” perception of webcam sex, and a cultural norm of “family first” that promotes choosing the needs of the family over the child’s welfare.
3 In addition, consumerism among youth 
may drive involvement in online sexual exploitation where money is spent on food, internet access, clothes, cell phone load, alcohol, and drugs.
11
In 2013, an exploratory study on the nature and extent 
of livestream sexual abuse in the Philippines conducted by Terre des Hommes found three main categories according to scale of operation: individual operations, family-run operations, and large-scale, organized operations called “dens.”
11 Individual operations are run from private homes, 
internet cafes or a ““Pisonet”” (computers that will provide internet access for 5 minutes for every PhP 1.00). Children involved in online sexual abuse are also commonly involved in street prostitution. Family-run operations are common in very crowded and poor neighborhoods where children are coerced by parents and other family members. Dens are larger-scale operations involving whole neighborhoods or organized criminal group operations where children are hired or trafficked.
Locally published studies on the topic are few and 
most of the information comes from gray literature (i.e., organization research reports, student theses, and government reports and documents). News stories and articles are alternative sources of information. While the facts presented in media reports are not based on a systematic investigation of materials and resources as in published research, these can still provide contextual background and preliminary data for further investigation.
This review aimed to present preliminary information 
on SEACO in the Philippines using online news reports and media articles and provide insight into the geographic distribution of media reported cases of SEACO, the profile of victims and offenders and how offenders and victims become involved in SEACO. 
MEthods
To present preliminary information on SEACO in the 
Philippines, a review using online news reports and media articles was conducted. The search term employed “Philippines cybersex” using Advanced Search in Google News (https://news.google.com.ph) including articles from 1995 to 2015 and only those published in English. “Cybersex” was used as a search term to obtain the earliest articles published on this topic online as reported in studies published in 2005.

Sexual Exploitation of ChildrenGoogle News groups together similar reports from 
different sources. When multiple articles covered the same 
case, the article with the most comprehensive information was included. Information was extracted and entered in a spreadsheet independently by two authors (SH and AL). A third author ( JA) resolved discrepancies (i.e., inconsistent information). Duplicate articles and those that did not include information on details of the occurrence of SEACO in the Philippines were discarded (i.e., articles reporting on legislation, policies or programs; feature or opinion articles; columns and editorials); and articles where payment or subscription was needed were also not included.
rESuLTS
A total of 546 unique articles of potential relevance were 
identified from which 72 articles were selected and assessed for eligibility. Eventually, 55 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis (Figure 1).
The majority of news reports came from local online 
news sources (75%) and consisted of reports on the arrest or conviction of an offender (84%). The rest of the articles were features on victims or offenders. There were 3, 5, 10, 16, and 16 reports identified in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, 
respectively. The earliest article recovered was published by 
an international news agency on March 3, 2011 and featured the raid of a cybersex den in Olongapo City, where six minors aged 13 years and above were rescued. The most recent article was locally published on December 5, 2015 which reported the rescue of five minors from a cybersex operation run by their aunt in Cordova, Cebu.Forms of SEACO
Table 1 presents descriptions of actions involving 
child victims, offenders, and the form of ICT used. The reviewed articles revealed three main forms of online sexual exploitation of children: (1) live streaming of child sexual abuse, (2) child abuse material (child pornography), and (3) sextortion using minors.
Geographic distribution of SEACO cases
Since the news reports and feature articles may overlap 
and cover the same SEACO case, information on the identity of offender, location of arrest or conviction and date of publication were extracted and consolidated to determine the actual number of cases. Out of 55 articles, 43 unique cases of SEACO were identified. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of SEACO cases by region.
Victims
The victims’ age and sex were not given in almost half 
of the articles. In 26 news reports that provided information on the sex of victims, the children rescued were female only (72%), male and female (24%), and male only (4%). In 25 news reports that provided information on the age of victims, the age ranged from 18 months to 17 years.
Offenders
Table 2 lists the different types of offenders based on 
offender descriptions derived from the news reports and the number of offenders under each type. More than half of the identified offenders were reported to be operators (58%). The rest were operator-perpetrators (14%), pimps (14%), clients (10%), and recruiters (4%). There were slightly more male offenders (56%) than female offenders (44%). All the clients were male. One third of the offenders were foreigners.

Sexual Exploitation of ChildrenTable 3 shows the characteristics of the foreign offenders 
reported to be involved in SEACO in the Philippines. Out 
of 14 offenders, six were out of the country. Several clients in the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom had been charged or convicted in relation to SEACO in the Philippines. A number of foreigners in possession of child pornography and/or operating cybersex dens had also been arrested, along with local partners in Manila, Bulacan, Olongapo City, province of Cebu, General Santos City, and Cagayan de Oro City. There were no reports of convicted local offenders. Among the local offenders, there were 11 (30%) who were biologically related to the victims (Table 4). The family members involved were in their 30s and consisted mostly of mothers.Table 2. Number and types of offenders according to acts described in the news reports

Sexual Exploitation of ChildrenType of operation
Table 5 shows the distribution of cases according 
to type of operation. There were five cases of family-run 
operations of SEACO where children were exposed to cyber pornography by parents or other family members, typically mothers. Three of the reported cases were located in Barangay Cogon, Cordova, Cebu. The family members’ involvement included being the pimp of their daughters, guiding the sexual performances on- and off-camera and sexual abuse of a child on-camera. There were two mothers involved in cybersex who exposed their daughters when their clients asked for children.
There were 20 cases that involved cybersex dens, hidden 
in two- or three-story houses and rented apartments, several in slum areas. There was one encounter that occurred in a hotel room. Minors were initially recruited as a babysitter or domestic helper, or for work in internet cafés in the city and later forced into cybersex. Cybersex operations involved uploading sexually explicit images of children, nudity in front of a webcam, and live sexual performances with children or among children. In one operation, snapshots of naked children cost USD50, nudity in front of the webcam cost USD100, and a live sex show among children cost as high as USD500. The children, or parents, got USD10-USD18 per show. Sudden show of increased wealth would arouse suspicion in the community but did not always prompt reporting. The cybersex dens were discovered through disclosure from child victims, tips from foreign agencies, through information arising from investigations (i.e., arrest of a client in another country), and through local surveillance based on tips from neighbors and informants. The increased fortune of operators also leads to the proliferation of operations within communities, giving rise to a “cottage industry” in some towns. In raids conducted of cybersex dens, authorities confiscated cell phones, computers, laptops, and tablets containing sexually explicit images of children as well as receipts for money transfer remittances from foreigners.
In eight cases, cybersex operations masqueraded as 
fake call centers or business establishments that sold child pornography. One of the operations rented a building within a school compound. The staff of the cybersex operations would chat online with foreigners, enticing them to subscribe to pornographic websites that contain images of Filipino Table 4.

Sexual Exploitation of Childrenchildren. Compared to cybersex dens, cybersex centers did 
not appear to involve actual children, but they operated as venues for sextortion or the online sale of child sexual abuse material. In sextortion, victims are found through social media, such as Facebook, and lured into cybersex using video call services such as Skype. The sexually explicit exchange is recorded by the suspects and is used to blackmail the victim in exchange for money.
DiSCuSSiON
Despite the Philippines having a reputation as a global 
hub for cybercrime, including child sexual exploitation, not much is known about this topic. Our review of media reports aimed to provide a picture of SEACO, however, our study was limited due to the following constraints. First, we included only online news reports as these are readily available. In trying to get more in-depth reports, we tried to obtain data from law enforcement agencies and child protection services, however, information was deemed confidential and classified. Conversely, a journalistic investigation published in 2016 revealed that in 2013, 57 live-streaming criminal cases have been reported in the Philippines which rose to 80 cases in 2014. In 2015, 167 ongoing, live-streaming criminal cases were reported in the Philippines.
12 
Second, while the earliest news report obtained was 
from 2011, earlier studies have documented raids of cybersex dens and the rescue of minors as early as 2005
5,6. Thus, the 
article from 2011 was an inaccurate marker of the emergence of SEACO in the Philippines and only reflected the point at which news reports became available online.
Third, we aimed to gain more insight into the 
characteristics and circumstances of SEACO victims because of the challenges in gaining access to and collecting information from this vulnerable population; however, the news reports revealed very little information about SEACO victims. Fourth, details of SEACO operations that could be gathered from the news reports were limited by the amount of information contained in the news reports. However, we think this review has contributed new and important information on the forms of SEACO and characteristics of offenders that have not been previously documented by other studies.
In this review, incidents of SEACO were first reported 
in Olongapo City, Cordova (a municipality in Cebu), Cagayan de Oro, and Davao City. In the succeeding years, cases were reported from contiguous provinces and cities, suggesting that physical proximity may be a factor in the spread of SEACO to other areas (Figure 3). Webcam child prostitution has been observed to be more prevalent in areas known for sex tourism, although a geographical link requires further investigation.
13 The areas identified in this review also 
coincided with research focus areas selected for the incidence of livestream child sexual abuse: Angeles City, Taguig City, Cebu City, and the municipality of Cordova in the province of Cebu.
11 As expected, there was very little and vague 
information on victims due to confidentiality. Since there were no consistent reports of the age and sex distribution of victims, this review provided limited information on the characteristics of victims other than that of the youngest age of a victim involved in SEACO, which was reported to be 18 months old.
The offender categories provided more information 
on the range of offenders involved in cybersex operations, including consumers of child sexual abuse material and operators of cybersex operations. Research suggests that offender motives vary according to type of offender: most child sexual abuse material consumers are motivated by sexual gratification while other offenders are interested in profit alone.
10 Although studies typically describe consumers 
of SEACO as white men, this study found foreigners not only as clients overseas but as partners of local operators. The foreign offenders were mostly in their mid-50s, older than the average age of 40 years seen in other studies.
3 Both 
men and women have been found to be involved as offenders in SEACO but females are reportedly involved to a limited extent. Their offenses are usually related to the possession, production, and distribution of child sexual abuse material.
14 
In commercial sexual exploitation, women are typically involved in running business operations and recruitment.
8 
Women are rarely the primary offender in child sexual abuse.
14 However, this review found that almost half of the 
offenders were women (44%) and that they played active roles in SEACO. Their active participation ranged from recruitment, trafficking and operating cybersex operations to the sexual abuse of a child during webcam performances. This review also highlighted the involvement of mothers in live streaming of child sexual abuse.
Individual operations involving children in webcam 
sexual performances from private residences, Internet cafés or “Pisonet” were not covered by the news reports. These operations lack an adult operator; inability to conduct money transfer payments and poor English skills may make it difficult for children to receive payments.
11 The absence 
of an organized operation possibly allows this type of live stream sexual abuse to escape police surveillance.
Livestream child sexual abuse constitutes a violation 
of several Philippine laws. A suspect may be charged with three different offenses, namely, child trafficking, child pornography, and child abuse.
12 In August 2015, 
the Philippines Department of Justice issued an advisory including the following laws as applicable on the issue of online child sexual abuse: UN Declaration on the Rights of the Child, Lanzarote Convention, Republic Act No. 7610 or the “Special Protection of Children against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act,” Republic Act No. 9775 or the “Anti-Child Pornography Act of 2009,” Republic Act No. 9262 or the “Anti-Violence against Women and their Children Act of 2004,” and Republic Act No. 10175 or “Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012.”
12 Despite having

Sexual Exploitation of Childrenthese laws in place, reporting and prosecution of suspects 
is hindered by a shortage of personnel to implement the laws, Philippine privacy laws, delay in prosecution due to authentication of foreign evidence, lack of knowledge among legal practitioners, low age of consent, and lack of support for victims.

CONCL uSiON AND rECOMMENDATiONS
Cases of SEACO have increasingly been reported in 
news and feature articles from almost every region in the country over the past ten years. The national legal framework for responding to SEACO is comprehensive and in compliance with international standards. However, grappling with the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse of children online requires measures to prevent the proliferation of this “industry” in the country. Identifying factors and addressing issues that encourage proliferation will be essential to impede its spread. More information on victims and the circumstances that lead them to become involved in SEACO is needed. The other players in SEACO also need to be looked into, including law enforcement authorities, telecommunications companies and money transfer agencies. Our review is the first step in confronting this problem.

Sexual Exploitation of Children"
ChildProtection,1005.txt,"COVID-19 and its implications 
for protecting children online
April 2020
COVID-19 has prompted widespread school closures and physical distancing measures and made online 
platforms and communities essential to maintaining a sense of normalcy. Children and their families are 
turning to digital solutions more than ever to support children’s learning, socialization and play. While digital 
solutions provide huge opportunities for sustaining and promoting children’s rights, these same tools may 
also increase children’s exposure to online risks. This technical note sets out some of the key priorities and 
recommendations on how to mitigate those risks and promote positive online experiences for children.
COVID-19 has abruptly pushed children’s daily lives online 
As of 3 April 2020, COVID-19 has led to at least 188 country-wide school closures , impacting more than 
90% of the world’s student population.
In places where there is wide access to digital technology, more and more aspects of people’s daily 
lives are moving online, as people choose or are asked to stay home. Internet usage is up 50%  in some 
parts of the world following the spread of COVID-19.
Similarly, many children’s learning experiences are being reshaped by the sudden introduction of 
remote learning, including – where available – technology and virtual platforms as a substitute for the 
classroom and schoolyard.   
Online games, social media and video chat programs are  providing opportunities  for children to 
connect with and play with their friends, parents and relatives while in isolation.
While children aged 13 and older  may already be familiar with social media, the pandemic has 
introduced younger children to social networking tools that may not be designed for them and for 
which they may have limited preparation. 
Parents and caregivers, meanwhile, are being asked to navigate their children’s shift to online learning 
and recreation while balancing work and other uncertainties related to the pandemic.
Increased online activity supports children’s learning, socialization and 
play, but also puts them at heightened risk
Increased internet use can put children at greater risk of online harms such as sexual exploitation and 
cyberbullying. Not all risks will translate into actual harm, but children facing other issues in their lives may 
be more vulnerable. It is important that measures to mitigate risks should be balanced with children’s rights 
to freedom of expression, access to information, and privacy. Keeping children informed and engaged and 
empowering them with the skills to use the internet safely is a critical line of defence.  
Online sexual exploitation. The most recent Global Threat Assessment  by WePROTECT Global Alliance 
and groundbreaking investigative reporting by New York Times  set out the scale and impact of online 
sexual exploitation. It is highly likely that COVID-19 will heighten this risk to children, as highlighted  by 
national law enforcement agencies and civil society organisations around the world. Spending more 
time online may increase the likelihood that children come into contact with  online predators. Physical 
distancing measures are likely to increase children’s outreach to new contacts and groups online, which 
could be exploited by predators to groom children for sexual exploitation. With more adults isolated at 
home, there may also be additional demand for child sexual abuse material, leading to more commercial 
sexual exploitation of children. The livestreaming of sexual abuse by family members is already a well-
documented phenomenon in certain communities. Stay-at-home orders will also mean that families are 
forced to remain in close quarters, which, for children living with abusers, could result in an escalation of 
sexual abuse, both offline and online.
11For example  COPPA  and GDPR-K .Cyberbullying. It is well-established  that cyberbullying is a major concern  among teenagers and has wide-
ranging, negative impacts. With many children suddenly experiencing extended periods of unstructured 
time online and grappling with mounting sources of stress, cyberbullying could proliferate. The COVID-19 
pandemic has also introduced instant messaging, online gaming and chat services to an increasing 
number of young children, who may have limited online experience and be less resilient to hurtful 
behavior. Girls, children with disabilities and those perceived to be different or at greater risk of catching 
or spreading COVID-19 may be at increased risk of online bullying and discrimination.
Online risk-taking behavior. A lack of in-person interaction with friends and partners may lead older 
children to engage in riskier behaviour online, for example, through sexting or the sharing of self-
generated sexualized content , which may expose them to risks of extortion, harassment and humiliation.
Potentially harmful content. Increased online activity may expose children to age-inappropriate and 
potentially harmful content, including content that is violent, misogynistic, xenophobic, promotes political 
or ideological violence or incites suicide and self-harm. Children may also be exposed to a larger quantity 
of targeted online marketing  that promotes unhealthy foods, gender stereotypes or is age-inappropriate. 
They may also be exposed to misinformation  about COVID-19 that could drive additional fear and anxiety.
Inappropriate collection, use and sharing of data. The shift of children’s lives online, including via 
education technology, may result in the added collection and processing of children’s personal data by 
companies, along with increased exposure to digital marketing content and techniques. This may affect 
children under 13 years of age who normally have privacy protection  by law.1
Limited child safeguarding online. With the rush to set up distance learning, schools may not have 
proper child safeguarding policies in place to govern student and teacher conversations via private 
networks and other online tools. Parents and caregivers may not be aware of school district policies, if 
they exist, and may be unfamiliar with new technologies , limiting their ability to engage their children in a 
discussion about keeping safe online.
Governments, companies, schools and parents must work together to 
ensure that children’s online experiences are safe and positive
In the context of COVID-19, keeping children safe online will require concerted, urgent action on the part of 
parents and caregivers, school authorities, digital technology companies, providers, social service workers 
and governments.
1.  Empower children online
Parents and caregivers, school authorities, digital technology companies, media providers, social 
service workers and governments must recognize that children are agents of change and should equip 
them with the knowledge and information they need to navigate their online lives safely during the 
COVID-19 crisis and beyond.
Messages, information and advice on navigating the digital world should be targeted to children in a 
manner and via the channels that most resonate with them. Children should also be informed about 
how to seek out help and support.
2Children should also be encouraged to use their voices online to support others in need of help during 
this crisis.Children’s perspectives should inform improvements to platforms and other changes intended 
to keep them engaged and safe during this quickly moving emergency. Government and social service 
providers should incorporate children’s voices  and actively involve children in policymaking that  
affects them.  
2. Support parents and caregivers to help children stay safe online
Parents and caregivers can help children access the online resources that are vital for learning,  
socializing and playing in the era of COVID-19. At the same time, parents and caregivers need to be 
alert to the online risks  for children. Governments, companies and others should support parents with 
appropriate guidance and tools , including how to respond to and, if needed, report harmful contacts, 
conduct and content.
Parents and caregivers can establish with their children rules for how, when and where the Internet 
can be used. Boundaries should be set to establish a healthy balance between online time and other 
activities. Parents and caregivers should also ensure their children’s device/s have the latest software 
updates and antivirus programmes and ensure that privacy settings are set to ‘high.’  For younger 
children, tools such as parental controls can help mitigate online risks.
Parents and caregivers can discuss openly with their children how and with whom the children are 
communicating online. Children need to know that kind and supportive interactions are expected, and 
that hurtful, discriminatory  or inappropriate contact is never okay. Children should feel confident about 
telling a trusted adult immediately if anything distressing or inappropriate occurs.
Parents and caregivers can also help children differentiate between regular content and 
advertisements and engage in dialogue with their children to seek to counteract any negative 
messages.
Parents and caregivers can be alert to signs of distress that may emerge in connection with children’s 
online activity. For example, if a child is experiencing cyberbullying, they may give off warning signs, 
such as using their device more or less frequently, or becoming withdrawn or depressed. Governments, 
companies and school administrators should make parents and caregivers familiar with relevant 
policies, as well as online and offline reporting mechanisms. Parents should have the numbers of 
support helplines and hotlines handy and contact the police if their children’s distress is related to 
threats, potential crimes or other illegal behaviors.
3. Provide a safe online learning experience for students
Schools should create or update their current safeguarding policies  to reflect the new realities for 
children learning from home. One-on-one online interactions between school staff and students 
should be transparent and regulated. Specific safeguards may include requiring schools to share 
online schedules; advising children to wear appropriate clothing when in front of webcams and not 
to connect with their teachers or virtual classrooms from bedrooms; and refraining from using private 
instant messaging services in teacher-student communications or asking for consent from parents for 
such sessions. Schools should also seek digital security mechanisms to ensure that only authorized 
individuals are able to access online learning platforms and that those platforms do not record and 
store the virtual learning sessions by default.
Schools should clearly communicate online safety policies and provide resources  and information on 
digital safety to support parents and caregivers in creating a positive online learning experience e.g. 
Interland , internetmatters.org , NSPCC  and Childnet International .
3Schools should clearly communicate with all learners the expected code of conduct on digital platforms 
and communications, just as would be expected for ‘in person’ behavior.  They should promote and 
monitor good online behavior among students. Schools should be aware that younger children in 
particular may not have developed or practiced these skills before and could unintentionally hurt 
others. Schoolyard bullying among classmates may easily morph into cyberbullying, and school 
authorities need to adapt anti-bullying rules and policies to online spaces and make them clear to 
students and parents
Schools should ensure that children have uninterrupted access to school-based counseling services. 
In the absence of in-person contact with counselors, children in distress must have safe, confidential 
means of securing support online or by phone. There may be increased need for counselling services 
in the context of COVID-19, where children may be experiencing family problems, domestic violence or 
heightened feelings of insecurity and anxiety. Girls, children with disabilities and those perceived to be 
different or at greater risk of catching or spreading COVID-19 may be experiencing increased anxieties 
requiring additional support. Schools should promote country-specific helplines  or online counselling 
platforms. Schools should also update guidance for teachers on identifying and reporting child abuse or 
neglect via their virtual communications.
4. Make online platforms safe and accessible for children
In order to avoid exacerbating inequalities during the pandemic, technology companies should work 
with governments to improve access to digital devices and internet connectivity for disadvantaged 
children, including those who are affected by poverty, separated, on the move, disabled, in domestic 
and family violence settings, conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary 
caregivers to the pandemic. ITU’s new Global Network Resiliency Platform ( #REG4COVID ) is a place for 
regulators, government authorities and industry to share and pool experiences, ongoing initiatives and 
innovative policy and regulatory measures designed to help ensure communities (and children) remain 
connected. Technology companies should also make online learning resources available for free or 
at significantly reduced cost to educators and students. Mobile operators should consider providing 
online learning resources and COVID-19 health information for free.
It is imperative that increased safety features are incorporated into all devices, including those being 
made available at low or no cost, and that parents and caregivers are instructed how to activate  
these features.
Companies that are developing and deploying virtual classrooms and other education-specific 
platforms should make sure that safety features are integrated and enhanced  and clearly accessible to 
educators, parents and students. Data collection and other commercial practices should be transparent, 
responsible and reflective of national/international laws and regulations. Social networking platforms 
used for teacher-student interactions should employ built-in protection measures for children while 
giving adult teachers appropriate permissions to carry out their functions. Furthermore, online platforms 
using video conferencing services, which are increasingly being used for online interactive sessions, 
should ensure that relevant security and privacy protections are in place.
Companies should use their platforms to promote and facilitate child safety referral services and 
helplines for the estimated 1.5 billion children  and youth currently out of school, some of whom may be 
at increased risk of psychosocial stress, violence and exploitation. This includes sharing information on 
referral and other support services available for youth, such as national Child Helplines. Companies can 
seek to increase child helpline capacity with cloud-based infrastructure and by leveraging Interactive 
Voice Response (IVR)/bot systems to automate helpline queries. Mobile operators should enable short-
codes or free-of-cost calls, waving interconnect charges and promoting referral and helpline resources 
to children.
4Given that the pandemic is bringing younger children onto education and social networks (some for the 
first time), companies should make significant efforts to help them, and their parents and caregivers, 
learn to use online resources safely . This includes: 
Adapting online safety resources to different age groups and making these resources more 
accessible on their platforms to inform children, parents and caregivers of online risks and provide 
access to support services.
Offering clearly signposted and easy to use technical tools and solutions (e.g. ‘parental controls’) 
which can empower parents and caregivers to help their children experience digital technology in an 
age-appropriate way.
Amplifying messaging on safe and responsible behaviour online and supporting children to develop 
‘digital resilience’ skills – in other words, knowledge of how to navigate and respond to risks.
5. Strengthening national prevention, response and support services. 
Governments should actively monitor how restricted movement and lockdowns may exacerbate 
different forms of violence, both offline and online, using the latest data and existing models  to inform 
policy. Governments should enforce existing regulations and strengthen law enforcement to help 
monitor and respond to increased online risks.
Governments should allocate sufficient resources to bolster, train and equip core child protection 
workers to ensure that they can continue to keep children safe throughout the pandemic. Wherever 
possible, countries should maintain center-based supports and home visiting for those severely 
affected or adapt and deliver social services virtually.
Governments should train health, education and social service workers on the impacts that COVID-19 
may have on child well-being, including increased online risks. Those providing front line mental 
health/psychosocial support will need skills in talking to children about COVID-19 and addressing their 
anxiety and insecurity.  Special attention should be paid to the most vulnerable children including those 
separated, on the move, disabled, in conflict settings and those who may have lost parents or primary 
caregivers to the pandemic.
Government should be aware of the potential increased online risks to children during the pandemic 
and seek to address them through increased monitoring and enforcement of existing regulations.  Law 
enforcement should be supported to monitor a potential increase in online offending behavior and 
have their units functional to respond to this.
Governments should make sure social service providers, schools, parents, caregivers and children are 
aware of local reporting mechanisms, and that they have the support numbers of local helplines and 
hotlines. If they do not already exist, local helplines and hotlines should be installed to support children 
in distress. The major international reporting networks include INHOPE Hotlines  and IWF portals . 
Children can find direct support through the nationally-based Child Helpline . The public should be 
directed to contact the police when there is imminent danger. 
To complement efforts to connect children to resources for online learning, socialization and play, 
governments should step up educational initiatives on child online safety. These should include raising 
awareness about online risks and resources, using media and other communications channels to 
spread key messages.

ABSTRACT
Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in
children and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors
associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the impor-
tance of their identi ﬁcation for intervention purposes. It stands to
reason that parents can in ﬂuence child MTSD use, via their attitudes,
beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the
associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD
use and whether parenting styles speci ﬁcally with regard to child
MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents ( N= 1283) were surveyed about
their children ’s digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regard-
ing the child ’s MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of
mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct “digital par-
enting styles ”were identi ﬁed and these resembled general parenting
styles. Findings further suggeste d that children spent more time with
MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative
and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater
attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes
towards, and attributed less harm and more bene ﬁts to, early device
use. These results are the ﬁrst evidence for existence of digital parent-
ing styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential pre-
vention and treatment targets.ARTICLE HISTORY

1. Introduction
Mobile touch screen device (MTSD) use is becoming increasingly widespread among
children (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ). Children can use touchscreen devices, even before
they develop advanced motor skills, as they do not need to use controllers as they do with
personal computers or videogames. Consequently, children can begin MTSD use at an
increasingly early age. According to a US survey, the average daily time children spend with
mobile device use is almost an hour for 2 –4-year-olds and 7 minutes for children under the
age of 2 (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ). Comparable trends are apparent in Hungary (Pintér,
2016 ; where access to internet and use of digital technologies is comparable to the
European average; Hungarian Central Statistical O ﬃce,2017 ). Yet, relatively little research

TV) has (mainly negative) e ﬀects on child development (Chonchaiya & Pruksananonda,
2008 ; Zimmerman & Christakis, 2005 ). Arguably, early MTSD use (i.e., in infancy, toddlerhood
and preschool years) is likely similarly important from a developmental perspective, with
potentially both negative and positive e ﬀects (e.g., Bedford, Saez de Urabain, Celeste,
Karmilo ﬀ-Smith, & Smith, 2016 ; Li, Subrahmanyam, Bai, Xie, & Liu, 2018 ). As such, better
understanding of the characteristics and factors that are associated with earlier or more
intensive use may have implications for psychoeducation as well as prevention and inter-
vention e ﬀorts.
1.1. Direct and indirect links between parenting and child behavior
Children ’s behavior, development, and sociali zation are supposed to be directly in ﬂuenced by
their microsystem (i.e., family, p eers, and school; Bronfenbrenner, 1979 ). Especially during
early developmental stages (e.g., prior to start ing school), the family, and in particular the
parents have perhaps the greatest in ﬂuence on child behavior, relative to later developmental
stages (e.g., adolescence) which are characterized by increased peer in ﬂu e n c e( L a i b l e ,C a r l o ,&
Raﬀaelli, 2000 ). It has been hypothesized that parents directly in ﬂuence child behavior via rule
setting (Steinberg & Darling, 2017 ) and also indirectly via various other means. For example,
parents play a large role in creating a home environment and di ﬀerent aspects of that
environment promote certain behaviors and not others (e.g., whether or not there is a TV
or a PC at home, if there is one in the child ’s bedroom). Parental attitudes and behaviors
(including role-modelling) are also related to c hild habits and lifestyle, such as with regard to
amount of physical activity (Arredondo et al., 2006 ) or sedentary behavior, including as a result
of screen time (Xu, Wen, & Rissel, 2015 ). Beyond shaping and reinforcing speci ﬁc behaviors,
parenting also involves creation of a socioemotional environment through speci ﬁcparenting
styles that may a ﬀect child behavior (Rhee, 2008 ).
1.1.1. Parenting styles in the context of MTSD use
Parenting styles are strongly related to child development and outcomes (e.g., Kordi &
Baharudin, 2010 ). Parenting styles correspond to the emotional climate in which parents
raise their children (Steinberg & Darling, 2017 ) and can be characterized by dimensions of
responsiveness/warmth (responding to the child ’s needs in a supportive, accepting, nurtur-
ing and involved manner) and demandingness/control (setting demands, rules, control,
expectations, boundaries to integrate the child into the society; Baumrind, 1991 ; Spera,
2005 ). Four parenting styles can be formulated along these dimensions: authoritative (high
warmth, high demand), permissive (high warmth, low demand), laissez-faire (low warmth,
low demand) and authoritarian (low warmth, high demand).
Authoritative parenting involves high warmth, sensitivity, responsiveness and involve-
ment, as well as high expectations and high demands for maturity and self-control from
the child. Authoritative parents respect the child ’s opinion, but also maintain clear
boundaries. They foster their demands through bidirectional communication (e.g., expla-
nations of rules) and encouragement of independence.
Permissive parenting corresponds with high warmth but low demand. They set few
rules or boundaries and do not have high expectation for maturity. They refrain from
confrontations with their children, and rarely give guidance.92 V. KONOK ET AL.Parents with a laissez-faire parenting style show low warmth, responsiveness and
emotional involvement. and also have low demands. They do not set rules, do not provide
guidance and discipline. They make no demands for maturity, and impose few controls on
their child ’s behavior.
Authoritarian parents are not warm and responsive. They have high maturity demands,
are strict, expect obedience, and assert power. They express their expectations through
orders and do not explain to their children the rationale behind these rules.
Speciﬁc parenting styles in relation to certain areas or domains of parenting may exist
and these may not necessarily be the same across domains or even as general parenting
styles, they may nevertheless a ﬀect children ’s behavior or functioning in that domain (e.g.,
eating behavior; Vereecken, Legtest, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Maes, 2009 ). With regard to
media-related behaviors, parenting styles may also be expressed through levels of warmth
and demandingness. Parental responsiveness/warmth may manifest in parents supporting
their child ’s desired digital activity, e.g., letting the child watch videos or play games, helping
the child engage in certain activities (e.g., launching an application) or teaching the child
how to engage in such activities on their own. Parental demandingness, on the other hand,
may manifest in parents controlling and setting limits over the child ’s digital activities or in
supervising such activity. Indeed, parenting styles related to children ’s internet use were
found to statistically predict that use in school-aged children (Valcke, Bonte, De Wever, &
Rots, 2010 ). Children whose parents had a permissive Internet parenting style used the
internet the most and those whose parents adopted an authoritarian or authoritative
Internet parenting style used it the least. Similarly, stricter parental rules regarding TV
watching were found to be negatively associated with children ’ss c r e e nt i m e( C i l l e r o&
Jago, 2010 ). Neither the presence/nature of parenting styles related to children ’sM T S Du s e
(digital parenting styles) nor the associations of those with children ’s actual use have been
investigated to date. Identifying and better understanding these are timely, given the ever-
growing presence of digital media in the daily lives of families and society and thus its
potential to impact child development.
Digital parenting styles may not only in ﬂuence the time children spend with MTSDs, but
also the way they use it. For example, parents who expect maturity from the child or who are
involved in their child ’s MTSD use may teach the child how to use the MTSD in a functional
way. Alternatively, children whose parents onl y give them the device as a form of engagement
o rw h or e s t r i c tt h eu s em a yu s et h eM T S Df o rs i m pler activities or in a non-functional way.
The importance of parents for children ’s media use has been addressed in several
studies on parental mediation. Parental mediation includes a set of strategies used by
parents “to control, supervise or interpret media content for children ”(Warren, 2001 ,
p. 212). Previous research has suggested th at use of parental mediation is associated
with less overall time spent with, and less negative outcomes of media use (Gentile,
Nathanson, Rasmussen, Reimer, & Walsh, 2012 ; Kalmus, Blinka, & Olafsson, 2015 ).
However, the concept of a digital parenting style is broader than parental mediation
as it includes amount of guidance and inv olvement with child digital device use.
Additionally, the parenting style concept o ﬀers a dimensional view in which parental
behavior can be placed along the dimensions of warmth and demandingness. This also
emphasizes the emotional nature of these parenting styles rather than focusing solely
on parental behavior (as in case of parental mediation).JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 931.1.2. Role-modelling in the context of MTSD use
Children learn observationally (social learning theory; Bandura, 1977 ) by attending to and
imitating people in their surroundings. They identify with the model and take on
observed behaviors, values, beliefs, and attitudes of the person. People in the immediate
surrounding of the child, especially parents, can more easily become role-models for the
child and role-modelling is an important aspect of parental in ﬂuence (e.g., on child eating
habits and obesity; Brown & Ogden, 2004 ). This is applicable to media consumption, as
parental media use has been shown to predict child media habits (Bleakley, Jordan, &
Hennessy, 2013 ; Lauricella, Wartella, & Rideout, 2015 ) especially in case of heavy parental
use (Rideout, Foehr, & Roberts, 2010 ; Woodard & Gridina, 2000 ). Examples include asso-
ciations between family TV time and child TV time (Cillero & Jago, 2010 ; Duch, Fisher,
Ensari, & Harrington, 2013 ) or parental smartphone or tablet-use and child device use
(Lauricella et al., 2015 ). Of note, it is not only overt parental behavior (i.e., digital device
use) but also attitudes and emotions that can be modelled for children to imitate. Yet, no
study focused on whether parental attachment to these devices is associated with child
MTSD use to date. Furthermore, beyond role-modelling, parental media use can also
inﬂuence child behavior insofar as it corresponds to less parental attention and other
resources allocated to the child. For example, parents who watch more TV (Kirkorian,
Pempek, Murphy, Schmidt, & Anderson, 2009 ) and who are heavy mobile users (Radesky,
Schumacher, & Zuckerman, 2015 ) engage in less parent –child interaction.
1.1.3. Other parental factors in ﬂuencing child MTSD use
1.1.3.1. Parental attitudes. Parents ’attitudes toward certain activities or habits predict
whether/to what extent/how their children will engage in those activities (e.g., eating
behavior; Scaglioni, Salvioni, & Galimberti, 2008 ). Parental role-modelling, practices, rules
and parenting style may all be in ﬂuenced by parental attitudes (as attitudes predict
behavior; Fishbein, & Ajzen, 1974 ). Parental attitudes toward child media use are mixed
and largely depend on media type (Rideout et al., 2010 ): while parental attitudes toward TV
use are mixed, they are more positive toward computer use (Rideout & Hamel, 2006 ). In
turn, more positive parental attitudes toward media are associated with longer child time
with those media (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ; Vandewater et al., 2007 ). However, to our knowl-
edge, only two studies examined this association in case of MTSDs (Lauricella et al., 2015 ;
Nikken & Schols, 2015 ;s e eb e l o wi nt h e “Parental Beliefs ”section). Furthermore, there is
disproportionate focus on cognitive aspects of attitudes, i.e., opinions about MTSD use at
the expense of focus on emotional aspects of those (Pooley & O ’Connor, 2000 ).
1.1.3.2. Parental beliefs. Beliefs are the cognitive source of attitudes (Fishbein, & Ajzen,
1975). Parental beliefs regarding child media use (traditional and digital) –such as whether
and at what age the media have negative or positive e ﬀects on the child –may in ﬂuence
the degree to which parents allow or encourage their children ’s media use, which in turn,
can in ﬂuence how much the child uses these devices. For example, parents who attribute
positive e ﬀects to digital media engage in co-use and active mediation, whereas parents
who are concerned about negative e ﬀects are more likely to restrict their child ’sm e d i au s e
(Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ; Nikken & Schols, 2015 ). In support, parents ’belief that TV can be
helpful is associated with increased child screen time (Vandewater et al., 2007 ) and parents
who think that media provide a source of entertainment/relaxation and who think that it94 V. KONOK ET AL.has positive e ﬀects tend to have children who spend more time with MTSD use (Lauricella
et al., 2015 ; Nikken & Schols, 2015 ). In addition to these aspects of parental attitudes and
behaviors, other aspects of the microsystem within which youth function, such as socio-
economic status (SES) and parental education, can also impact child habits, including
screen time or MTSD use. For example, higher SES and parental education are related to
less time child spent with mobile media (Common Sense Inc., 2017 ; though others did not
ﬁnd such association in a much less representative sample; Kabali et al., 2015 ).
Taken together, some data on the associations between parental attitudes, beliefs, and
role-modelling and child media use (including MTSD use) are available, but no studies to
date have focused on the existence of digital parenting styles or the associations thereof
with child media use. In addition, in most studies, children ’s media use was measured only
in terms of amount of use. However, the type of use, e.g., what kind of activities children
are doing on these devices is also comparably important, as di ﬀerent activities (e.g.,
watching videos, taking photos, playing games) could have di ﬀerent e ﬀects on cognitive
development. Additionally, the relationship between parental factors and these speci ﬁc
activities is also important to explore, e.g., whether certain parental attitudes are related
to more advanced activities.
1.2. Aims and hypothesis
Our main aim was to reveal whether parents ’digital parenting style, general attitude , and
beliefs regarding early MTSD use and role-modelling as indicated by their own mobile
attachment and use are associated with child digital activity indexed by the amount of
time and type of activity children engage in MTSD use.
1.2.1. Exploratory research questions
To this end, we ﬁrst identi ﬁed types of MTSD use (and user types) in children (Exploratory
Research Question 1 a, b) and investigated (Exploratory Research Question 2) whether
digital parenting styles can be identi ﬁed (and conceptually determine whether these
correspond to general parenting styles as described by Baumrind, 1991 ). Following an
explorative design, we relied on a data-driven analytic approach involving principal
component analysis (PCA) using items selected based on high-frequency responses in
an open-ended questionnaire survey.
Also exploratorily, we aimed to identify di ﬀerent kinds of parental beliefs regarding the
potential bene ﬁcial and harmful e ﬀects of early MTSD use (Exploratory Research Question 3).
1.2.2. Hypotheses
We hypothesized that children engage in MTSD use for a greater amount of time and in
a more active/advanced manner, if their parents: ( H1) have a permissive digital parenting
style, ( H2) have a more positive general attitude toward early MTSD use, ( H3) have more
positive cognitive concepts or beliefs (i.e., they attribute more bene ﬁcial and less harmful
eﬀects to early use), ( H4) also use their own mobile phone for greater amounts of time,
and ( H5) are more attached to their phone.
Variables that may have confounding e ﬀects on child MTSD use, such as parental
educational level and child age and sex (Kabali et al., 2015 ; Lauricella et al., 2015 ) were
accounted for.JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 95Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no data are available about how the age of
onset of MTSD use changed over the past years and it was our aim to investigate the
existence of such trends. Parents were asked to retrospectively report on when their child
ﬁrst engaged in MTSD use. We hypothesized (H6) that the age of onset of MTSD use has
been becoming earlier, and thus that younger children are more likely to be an MTSD user
by a given age than older children.
2. Method
2.1. Participants and procedure
Participants were recruited online, through F acebook and the website of a Hungarian online
magazine, where the study questionnaire ( Digital Kids Questionnaire ; see below) was adver-
tised. Parents were included if they had a child aged between 0 and 7 years. This age group
was chosen because we were interested in MTSD use in early childhood (Nores & Barnett,
2010 ): in this age, the e ﬀects of MTSD use on development could be bigger and more long-
lasting (Schoenmaker et al., 2015 )a n dt h ei n ﬂuence of parents on their child behavior is
relatively greater (Laible et al., 2000 ) than during later ages. Additionally, based on results of
our open-ended survey (see below), we assumed that in children older than 7 years, there
would be less variability in experience with MTSD use. A total of 1283 parents completed the
Digital Kids Questionnaire ;1 3w e r ee x c l u d e dd u et oi n c o n s i s t e n tr e s p o n d i n g .T h e ﬁnal sample
thus consisted of 1270 parents who reported on 680 boys and 590 girls (see Table 1 for
descriptive statistics). Parents with more than one child in this age group were asked to
c h o o s et h ec h i l dw h o s es u r n a m e ’sﬁrst letter was earlier in the alphabet.
Parents who completed the questionnaire were entered into a lottery involving two
drugstore vouchers (5000 HUF).
The study sample was di ﬀerent from the average Hungarian population ( http://www.ksh.
hu) insofar as female respondents (82.8%), thos e with at least a college degree (74.3%) and
those living in the capital city (55.2%) were overrepresented.
Completing the questionnaire took approximately 20 –30 minutes. Data collection took
place between May and August of 2016.
2.2. Measure: Digital Kids Questionnaire
This questionnaire was based on the earlier open-ended survey completed by parents
(N= 96) of children aged between 0 and 10 years. Based on open-ended survey responses,
an inductive content analysis (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008 ) was conducted, via compilation of a code
book from each unique response and creation of higher-order categories from these (if ≥5%
of the respondents gave the respective answers, a category was created). The obtained
categories were then used in the Digital Kids Questionnaire as forced-choice (yes/no) items of
the digital parenting style and parental beliefs questions.
Theﬁnal version1was comproed of questions about the following (variable names
indicated with italics).
Demographics: We asked about age and sex of the child ( child age, child sex) , age and
sex of the child ’s parent who completed study questionnaires (parental age and parental
sex)and the highest level of education of the child ’s both parents (parental education).96 V. KONOK ET AL.Table 1. Independent and dependent variables: de ﬁnitions, measurements, and descriptive statistics, where applicable/interpretable.

Parental education Variable with 6 levels: 1 = elementary school; 2 = technical school; 3 = high school; 4 = bachelor ’s
degree/college; 5 = master ’s degree/university; 6 = doctoral degree/postgraduate. A mean
score was computed from the two parents ’educational levels, when available.1 6 4.25 0.83
Digital Parenting Styles Variable with 16 response choices2(based on the obtained categories of the open-ended version
of the questionnaire) and an “other ”option. A principal component analysis was carried out,
and PCA scores were used for subsequent analyses.N/A (principal component scores)
Parental Mobile Use Activities of interest were: web-browsing, listening to music, watching movies or videos, reading
books, editing/reading documents, reading/sending e-mails, accessing social networking sites,
camera, games, chat. Parents had to rate on a 5-grade scale how frequently (from “never ”to
“daily ”) they use their phone for the activity.
A total Parental mobile use score ( α= 0.802; good) was computed and used in analyses.1 5 2.98 0.89
Parental Mobile Attachment Variable included four items from the Mobile Attachment Questionnaire (Konok et al., 2017 ), one
from each subscale3. Parents had to rate each statement on a 5-grade –scale, based on how
characteristic it was for them.
A total Parental mobile attachment score ( α= 0.742; acceptable) was computed and used for
analysis.1 5 2.35 0.95
Parental Attitude Variable expressed as agreement with either that it is better for a child to start MTSD use “as late
as possible ”(negative attitude, 1 point) or “as early as possible ”(positive attitude, 3 point), or
with neither (neutral/mixed attitude, 2 point). This three-level ordinal variable was used in
analyses.NNegative attitude = 408
NNeutral/Mixed Attitude = 589
NPositive Attitued = 273
Beliefs about harms Parents were asked whether there are any harmful/bene ﬁcial consequences of early MTSD use
and, if yes, what those are (with 194and 135response options, respectively, based on the
obtained categories of the open-ended version of the questionnaire). For the analyses, a total
Beliefs about harms (α= 0.803; good) and Beliefs about bene ﬁts(α= 0.774; acceptable) score
was computed (but a PCA was also carried out). Responses indicating that early MTSD use has
no potential harmful/bene ﬁcial consequences corresponded to a score of zero on Beliefs about
harms/Beliefs about bene ﬁtssubscale.0 16 6.13 4.23
Beliefs about bene ﬁts 0 13 4.70 3.74
Dependent variables Amount of MTSD use Parents were asked about the frequency (with 8 levels) and duration (with 7 levels) of the child ’s
MTSD use. The combination of these two data was used as a dependent variable in the
analyses6(minutes/day).0 360 13.01 30.84
Type of user Parents were asked about the activities their child engages in on the device/s (hereafter labelled
“Activities ”): with 33 response choices, e.g., “uses touchscreen ”,“plays with games ”,“watches
movies ”and an “other ”option). We ran a PCA on these items, and a cluster analysis based on
the PCA scores. Cluster membership was used as dependent variable in analyses.See Supplemental Material 3 for
cluster frequenciesJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 97Characteristics of the Child MTSD Use : Parents were asked whether their child uses
a tablet/smartphone regularly, and if yes, about the frequency and duration of the child ’s
MTSD use (amount of MTSD use) , and the typical activities the child engages in on the
MTSD (activities).
Digital Parenting Styles: Parents were asked how they react to situations wherein the
child showed interest in an MTSD device (digital parenting style).
Parental Role-Modelling: Questions were asked about the frequency of parental mobile
use for various activities (based on Konok, Gigler, Bereczky, & Miklósi, 2016 ; Konok, Pogány, &
Miklósi, 2017 ;parental mobile use) , and about parental behavior and feeling characteristics of
attachment to their mobile phones (based on Konok et al., 2017 ;parental mobile attachment).
Parental Attitude: We assessed parents ’general attitude toward early MTSD use
(parental attitude) .
Parental Beliefs: We asked parents about their opinions about possible harmful and
beneﬁcial consequences of early MTSD use (beliefs about harms, Beliefs about bene ﬁts).
For the exact measurements of these questions (presented according to whether they
were used as dependent or independent variables in the analyses) see Table 1 .
2.3. Statistical analyses
Assumptions of statistical tests were considered prior to analyses (SPSS 22.0.0.).
Four principal component analyses (PCAs) with Varimax rotation were conducted on
the Activities (Q6), Parenting styles (Q8), Beliefs about harms (Q11) and Beliefs about
beneﬁts (Q13) items, separately. Although PCA is generally suggested for continuous
data, it is considered appropriate for binary data as well (Gower, 1966 ; Jolliﬀe,2002 ; Vyas &
Kumaranayake, 2006 ).
Items with a 0.4 or greater loading on a particular component were retained
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2001 ). Items with a 0.4 or greater loading on more than one
component were considered to cross-load and removed. The number of ﬁnal components
was determined based on both the eigenvalues (greater than 1) and the scree plot.
A two-step cluster analysis (distance: log-likelihood, clustering: BIC) was carried out to
classify children into groups on the basis of their activity types (Activities principal
component scores) and amount of MTSD use. The validity of the clusters was checked
using discriminant function analysis with leave-one-out cross-validation. Clusters were
also compared on each predictor variable using Kruskal –Wallis tests to see what level of
these variables characterise the clusters.
The association between Parenting styles principal component scores (independent vari-
ables; IVs) and children ’sAmount of use (dependent variable; DV) was examined using
a General Linear Model (GLM) ( n= 535; as parenting styles questions were only asked of
parents of regular MTSD users). A separa te GLM was carried out on the total sample ( N= 1270)
with parents ’scores on the Parental attitude, Beliefs about harms total score, Beliefs about
bene ﬁtstotal score, Mobile use ,a n d Mobile attachment total scores, parental education, child
age and sex as IVs and children ’sAmount of use as the DV (see Table 1 for list of IVs and DVs).
For those who responded that their child do es not regularly use MTSDs, the value for Amount
of use was set to zero.
To determine the extent to which parent variables ( Parental attitude, Parenting styles
principal component scores, Beliefs about harms, Beliefs about bene ﬁts, Mobile use, Mobile98 V. KONOK ET AL.attachment total scores and parental education) and child variables (age and sex) as IVs are
associated with child cluster membership ( Activities , DV), an ordinal logistic Generalized
Linear Model (GzLM) was estimated for the regular MTSD user subsample ( n=5 3 5 ) .
All GLM and GzLM initial models included main e ﬀects but not interactions. Stepwise
model selection with backwards elimination was used based on p-values.
To test whether children start using MTSDs earlier today than a few years ago, the ratio
of children who had and who had not started MTSD use before their 3rd birthday (Q5)
were compared between age groups using Chi-square tests (age group and MTSD use
before the 3rd birthday were the categorical variables, and Chi-square tests were ran
separately for mobile and tablet use). Only data of children at least 3 years old were used
in the analysis. The third birthday was chosen because setting this limit at an older age
(e.g., age 4), there would have been too few groups to compare (i.e., 4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-year-
olds), but setting it at a younger age (e.g., 2), there would have been too few children who
started MTSD use before their second birthday.
2.4. Ethical statement
This study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and national and
international guidelines (i.e., the Hungarian and the American Psychological Association)
with written informed consent obtained from all parents (and assent from children). The
study was approved by the United Ethical Review Committee for Research in Psychology
(EPKEB) (reference #: 06/2017).
3. Results
3.1. Identifying types of MTSD use/users
3.1.1. Types of use (exploratory research question 1a)
For descriptive statistics on the ratio of regular MTSD users to nonusers, and regular users ’
average time spent with MTSD use across di ﬀerent age groups, see Supplemental Material 1.
The PCA of the Activities items indicated three components (Supplemental Material 2).
Items 8, 13, 21, 26, 16, 29, 6, 15, and 28 were removed iteratively (in the listed order) due to
poor or to cross-loading. The three components were interpreted as Non-functional use (the
child uses the MTSD not for its designated functions, but as a toy or object generally, e.g.,
chews it or randomly pushes the buttons), Functional-active use (the child uses the MTSD for
its designated functions, autonomously and ac tively, e.g., launches applications or makes
calls) and Functional-passive use (the child uses the MTSD for its designated functions, but in
a passive way, i.e., participates in an activity tha t is typically initiated by someone, e.g., watches
videos but does not launch them). The three components together explained 45.5% of the
total variance.
3.1.2. Types of users (exploratory research question 1b)
The cluster analysis indicated three clusters (Supplemental Material 3): Beginners (children
who use the MTSD for short amounts of time and mainly for non-functional activities),
Passive/light users (who use the MTSD for moderate amounts of time, and mainly for
functional-passive activities), and Active/heavy users (who use the MTSD for long amountsJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 99of time and mainly for functional-active activities). The three clusters were well distin-
guishable (discriminant analysis with cross-validation: 98.8% success rate) from each other
based on the types of use (principal component scores) and amount of use. The three
clusters di ﬀered from each other on Activities principal component scores and amount of
MTSD use variables (Kruskal –Wallis tests, all ps<0.01). Pairwise di ﬀerences are indicated in
Supplemental Material 3.
3.2. Parents ’behavior and attitudes toward their child ’s MTSD use
3.2.1. Digital parenting styles (exploratory research question 2)
The PCA of the Parenting styles items indicated four components (Supplemental
Material 4). Items 11, 12, 16 were removed iteratively (in the listed order) due to cross-
loading. The four components corresponded to established parenting styles and were
thus interpreted as Permissive (the parent not only permits the child to use the MTSD, but
also shows how to use it or gives information), Authoritative (the parent permits the use
but with some limitations/conditions), Authoritarian (the parent restricts/prohibits the
usage or permits it only sometimes), and Laissez-faire (the parent permits the child to use
the MTSD in order to engage him/her). The four components together explained 48.3% of
the total variance.
3.2.2. Parental beliefs about potential harms and bene ﬁts of early MTSD use
(exploratory research question 3)
The majority (66%) of parents agreed both with the statement that MTSD use has
negative e ﬀects and the statement that it has positive e ﬀects on children.
Parents who agreed that using a tablet/smartphone in early childhood can have harmful
consequences (82%, n= 1041), were asked in what way they believed MTSD use can
potentially harm their children (see Table 1 for descriptives). The PCA on Beliefs about harms
items indicated three components (Supplemental Material 5). Items 17, 6, and 15 were
removed iteratively (in the listed order) due t o cross-loading. The three components were:
Disturbs development (early MTSD use disturbs/does not improve normal development/can
cause problems in development), Takes time from other things (early MTSD use takes time and
inclination away from other areas of life and/o r reduces interest or motivation to engage in
other developmentally typical activities) and Danger/addiction (early MTSD use is dangerous or
can be addictive). The three components toget her explained 40.7% of the total variance.
Parents who agreed that using a tablet/smartphone in early childhood can have
beneﬁcial consequences (77%, n= 981), were asked in what way they believed MTSD
use can potentially bene ﬁt their children (see Table 1 for descriptives). The PCA of Beliefs
about bene ﬁts items indicated four components (Supplemental Material 6): Openness/
entertainment (MTSD use makes the child more open to the world/new things and
provides an opportunity for entertainment), Skill-improvement (MTSD use improves gen-
eral skills), Information/learning (MTSD use aids learning new things/obtaining informa-
tion about the world) and Digital skills (MTSD use improves digital skills/aids learning
informatics). The four components together explained 53% of the total variance.100 V. KONOK ET AL.3.3. Associations of child and parent variables with the extent and type of child
MTSD use
3.3.1. Associations of child and parent variables with amount of use
Theﬁrst GLM supported H1: children of parents who have a permissive (parameter
estimate = 4.407; SE = 1.61; Wald χ2₁= 7.490; p= 0.006) or authoritative (parameter
estimate = 3.848; SE = 1.61; Wald χ2₁=5 . 7 1 2 ; p= 0.017) digital parenting style, engages
in more MTSD use whereas children of pare nts who have an authoritarian digital
parenting style (parameter estimate = −8.812; SE = 1.61; χ2₁= 29.947; p< 0.001) engage
in less MTSD use.
The second GLM supported H2-H5 except for H4: if the parent has a more positive
attitude toward early MTSD use ( H2), considers early MTSD use less harmful and more
beneﬁcial ( H3), has higher mobile attachment ( H5), then the child spends more time with
MTSD use. Contrary to hypotheses, parental mobile use was not associated with child
Amount of use in ( H4). Regarding the confounding variables, older children and children
of less-educated parents spend more time with MTSD use, but child sex was not asso-
ciated with Amount of use (Supplemental Material 7).
3.3.2. Associations of child and parent variables with types of users (clusters)
Findings suggested that if the parent is higher on permissive or the authoritative digital
parenting style and lower score on the authoritarian style ( H1), if (s)he attributes more

tablets ( χ2= 52.78; Φ= 0.26; p< 0.001) before their 3rd birthday depended on age groups:
in support of H6, younger children were more likely an MTSD user by their third birthday
than older children ( Figure 1 ).
4. Discussion
4.1. Digital parenting styles and their associations with children ’s MTSD use
To our knowledge, the current study is the ﬁrst to provide evidence for the existence of
digital parenting styles and for the association between such styles and amount and type
of child MTSD use. Taking an explorative approach, we identi ﬁed comparable parenting
styles in relation to children ’s MTSD use as those identi ﬁed in case of internet (Valcke et al.,
2010 ) and general (Baumrind, 1971 ) parenting styles.
Parents displaying a permissive digital parenting style allow their children to engage in
MTSD use, but they are also nurturing and inter active. For example, parents with this style
show their child how to use the application/device and answer the child ’s questions. As such,
permissive digital parenting is associated with low levels of demandingness and high levels ofJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 101involvement/warmth. From the perspective of a parental mediation framework, permissive
parents likely engage in active/interactive mediation (Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Conversely, authoritative digital parenting refers to a parenting style where MTSD use is
permitted but only under certain conditions (e.g., only after the child has attended to his/her
chores and obligations) and/or with certain limitations (e.g., time limits). Authoritative
digital parenting is thus characterized by high levels of demandingness and high levels of
involvement/warmth. Additionally, consistent with authoritative parenting involving
encouragement of child autonomy (Baumrind, 1971 ), parents with an authoritative digital
parenting style tend to not lock the device screen when they give it to the child or strictly
supervise use. Authoritative parents use some mixture of restrictive and active/interactive
mediation (setting limits and conditions; Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Parents exhibiting an authoritarian digital parenting style restrict/prohibit child MTSD
use and this parenting style is thus associated with high levels of demandingness and low
levels of involvement/warmth. Only one item that loaded strongly onto this component
describes some level of parental involvement, but even this item is a combination of
statements re ﬂecting di ﬀerent degrees of involvement ( “We do not give it to her/him, we
only show it/we watch the pictures/videos together ”). Therefore, authoritarian parents
use restrictive mediation and supervision (Nikken & Jansz, 2006 ).
Parents who adopt a laissez-faire digital parenting style allow their children to use the
device in order to engage him/her, suggesting that –at least in this context –they are not
nurturing or interactive. This digital parenting style is thus characterized by low demand-
ingness and low involvement/warmth. Laissez-faire parents do not engage in mediation.
Parenting styles are related to child development and outcomes (e.g., Kordi & Baharudin,
2010 ) yet little is known about the associations between digital parenting styles and child
digital device use. Consistent with our hypotheses, parents ’digital parenting style is
associated with amount and type of child MTSD use. Furthermore, it appears that this
association is driven primarily not by degree of parental demandingness, but by parental
Figure 1. Ratio of children who had and had not used mobile phone/tablet before their 3rd birthday in
diﬀerent age groups, reported by Hungarian parents. The ratios were calculated retrospectively from
parents ’reports about the age when their child started to use the devices.102 V. KONOK ET AL.involvement/warmth. Permissive and authoritative parenting was associated with longer
durations of MTSD use and more active or advanced use in children. In case of authoritarian
digital parenting, children use MTSDs for shorter durations of time and in a rather passive or
non-functional way. The degree to which parents exhibited a laissez-faire style was not
associated with amount of child MTSD use. This is in contrast with ﬁndings on school-aged
children ’s internet use, whose parental demandingness (permissive and laissez-faire styles)
was shown to be negatively associated with increased internet use (Özgür, 2016 ). However,
in contrast with older children and adolescents who possess the necessary skills and
knowledge to use Internet or digital devices (including MTSDs), and only need parental
permission to do so, young children may need guidance and support to learn MTSD use
and, as such, use them more if their parents have a warmer parenting style.
4.2. Associations of parental attitudes, beliefs, and role-modelling with children ’s
MTSD use
As expected, the more positive attitude the parents have regarding early MTSD use, the
more time the child spends engaging in such use. This result is consistent with earlier
ﬁndings indicating that positive attitudes toward media were related to higher rates of
child media consumption (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ).
Parental attitudes may be in ﬂuenced by parents ’beliefs about potential bene ﬁts and
harm of early MTSD use. In the current study, the positive and negative e ﬀects parents
attributed to early MTSD use were similar to those reported by Nikken and Schols ( 2015 ): it
improves the child ’s knowledge and skills, is an entertainment opportunity, but it can also
be dangerous (e.g., inappropriate content or inappropriate use, abuse by others) and
developmentally inappropriate. Parents in the current sample additionally reported that
a disadvantage of MTSDs is that they take time away from other activities.
In line with our hypotheses, we found t hat parents who attribute more bene ﬁts and less
harm to early MTSD use have children who spen dm o r et i m ew i t hM T S Du s e .T h i sc o r r e s p o n d s
to prior data on TV and media, which suggest th at parents who believe TV can be helpful have
children who watch more TV (Vandewater et al., 2007 ) and also that parental worries about
media are negatively related to chi ld TV consumption (Cingel & Krcmar, 2013 ). The majority
(66%) of our participants reported that they believed early MTSD use has both positive and
negative e ﬀects which are also consistent with earlier ﬁndings (Radesky et al., 2016 ).
Additionally, we found that parents who are less educated have children who spend
more time with MTSD use, consistent with what has been found with regard to child TV
screen time (Hesketh, Ball, Crawford, Campbell, & Salmon, 2007 ). Better educated parents
may be more aware of the problematic aspects of (TV or) mobile phone use and thus
consider these in their parenting (Roser, Schoeni, Foerster, & Röösli, 2016 ). Thus, educa-
tional background may in ﬂuence child MTSD use through in ﬂuencing beliefs and atti-
tudes with regard to early MTSD use.
Contrary to hypotheses and the ﬁndings of Lauricella et al. ( 2015 )a n dP e m p e ka n d
McDaniel ( 2016 ), amount of parental mobile use was not, but degree of parental mobile
attachment was, associated with amount of child MTSD use. This may be because it is not only
through their behavior but also through their attitudes and emotions that parents can be
role-models for their child. Parents ’higher mobile attachment may contribute to children
developing positive attitudes toward MTSDs and, as their parents are also more likely to allowJOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 103device use, to children using MTSDs more freque ntly. From another perspective, parents who
are highly emotionally involved in digital media may have less attentional resources to interact
with their child, resulting in the child engaging him/herself via some other means (e.g., with
MTSD use). Investigating these and other putative mediating mechanisms (e.g., role-
modelling, parenting styles and practices, h ome environment) between parental mobile
attachment and child MTSD use are important nex t steps for future research. Additionally,
some parents may refrain from using the smartph one in front of the child, while others do not,
and this may depend on their mobile attachme nt: those who have high mobile attachment
may not be able or willing to control their mobile use in front of the child. This can explain why
only parental mobile attachment, and not mobil e use is associated with child MTSD use. In the
future, parental mobile use should be investig ated separately based on whether it occurs in
front of the child or not.
4.3. Age of onset of MTSD use
Our results support the hypothesis that chil dren are starting to use MTSDs at a younger age
than was the case earlier (insofar as older children were less likely to have started MTSD use
b e f o r et h ea g eo f3t h a ny o u n g e rc h i l d r e n ) .I nc o n trast to the professional recommendations
to discourage or prohibit digital media use in c hildren under the age of 2 (American Academy
of Pediatrics, 2016 ;2018 ), more than one-third of the chil dren between the ages of 1 and 2 in
our sample were reported to have started MTSD use. Given signi ﬁcant neural plasticity at this
age (Schoenmaker et al., 2015 ), the observed trend calls for increased empirical study of the
various e ﬀects of early MTSD use.
4.4. Association of children ’s age with their MTSD use
Results show that as children get older, they spend more time with MTSD use (as in Kabali
et al., 2015 ; Lauricella et al., 2015 ; Roser et al., 2016 ). The proportion of regular MTSD users
also considerably increased with age, perhaps because MTSDs o ﬀer more opportunities
for older children who have more advanced cognitive and motor capabilities: the results
show that they typically use the MTSDs in a more advanced way.
4.5. Limitations and future directions
Although our ﬁndings establish important associations, our research design is not suitable for
causal inferences. Of note, we cannot rule ou tt h a ts o m ev a r i a b l e s ,s u c ha sc h i l dM T S Du s e
aﬀects parenting style, parental attitude/bel ief or parental mobile attachment and not the
other way around (or that there is a bidirectional e ﬀect). For example, it is possible that if the
child uses MTSDs more, parents develop more positive attitude and beliefs, either because
they experience positive/no negative consequ ences of the MTSD use or because of cognitive
dissonance reduction (Festinger, 1957 ). Similarly, not only can parenting style in ﬂuence child
characteristics, but the reverse is also possible (P adilla-Walker, Carlo, Christensen, & Yorgason,
2012 ). Additionally, it is also possible t hat parent variables indirectly a ﬀect children ’sM T S D
use. We referred to the possibility of di ﬀerent mediating and moder ating mechanisms. These
alternatives are hardly observable as experim ental studies in this topic are not possible to
carry out, but longitudinal studies may clarify some of these questions.104 V. KONOK ET AL.Another limitation to our study is that we observed digital parenting styles (parental
reactions to child MTSD use) only in parents who reported that their child shows interest
toward MTSDs. However, parents may o ﬀer MTSDs to the child even if he/she does not show
interest toward it, so parents can be proactive, not only reactive in their behaviors regarding
child MTSD use. This experimental consideration should be addressed in the future.
One of the strength of our study is its data-driven approach. Instead of pre-selected
questions (i.e., a theory-driven approach), we explored parents ’attitudes and behaviors
exerting as little in ﬂuence on those as possible. Nevertheless, the questionnaire will need
further validation in the future.
Although a recent study showed that when people are asked about how often they use
their mobile phone, the correlations are quite high between self-report and objective log-
data (Boase, & Ling, 2013 ), parents might have distorted their responses regarding their
mobile use and mobile attachment, especially given that these questions were asked after
parents described their opinions, attitudes and parenting behaviors related to child MTSD
use. Therefore, the order of questions may be bene ﬁcial to reverse in future studies.
Variables not assessed in this study may also be linked to child MTSD use. For example,
although we measured how much the parent uses their mobile phone and to what extent
they are attached to it, it would be also important to measure how much time the parent
uses their mobile phone (or other devices) in front of the children.
Parental mediation techniques could be also investigated in relation to digital parent-
ing styles, e.g., are digital parenting styles involve certain speci ﬁc mediation techniques as
we hypothesize above? To what extent are the two phenomena overlapping?
Additionally, a possible contribution in future studies could be to investigate whether
parents ’general parenting style and digital parenting style correspond or diverge. For
example, is it possible that a parent has a permissive digital parenting style, but an author-
itative general parenting style?
4.6. Conclusions
In conclusion, results suggest that parents may in ﬂuence their children ’sM T S Du s e ,t h r o u g h
modelling behavior, digital parenting style, attitudes and beliefs about early MTSD use, and
their educational level. Future studies should clarify how these variables are related, includ-
ing by assessing potential mediating and moderating mechanisms, and examining whether
digital parenting styles explain child MTSD use above and beyond other parental factors.
As children start to use MTSDs at an increasingly early age, and for increasing amounts
of time as they get older, it is predictable that MTSD use will further intensify in children
during the upcoming years. Adults exhibit attachment to their mobile devices (Konok
et al., 2017 ) and this attachment is not only also observable but may be more pronounced
in youth and this may potentially result in youth spending less time spent with other
(developmentally appropriate and important) activities and toys. Thus, there is urgent
need to examine possible e ﬀects of MTSD use on development. If ﬁndings indicate that
early MTSD use has some negative consequences on child development, in combination
with the current results, the data may suggest that a reduction in child MTSD use can be
achieved via changes in their parents ’attitudes and knowledge, i.e., parental education
(Hinkley, Cli ﬀ, & Okely, 2015 ).JOURNAL OF CHILDREN AND MEDIA 105Notes

Background : This study examined the cyberbullying experience and coping manners of 
adolescents in urban Vietnam and explored the mediating effect of different support to 
the associations between cyberbullying and mental health issues.
Methods : A cross-sectional study was performed on 484 students at four secondary 
schools. Cyberbullying experience, coping strategies, psychological problems, and family, 
peer, and teacher support were obtained. Structural equation modeling was utilized to 
determine the mediating effects of different support on associations between cyberbullying 
and psychological problems.
Results : There were 11.6 and 28.3% of students who reported that they experienced 
and observed at least one cyberbullying act in the last 3 months, respectively. Among the 
victims, only 48.2% tried to stop the perpetrators. Meanwhile, the majority of observers 
belonged to the “Intervene” group who tried to report cyberbullying acts or help victims. 
Family support was found to partially mediate associations between cyberbullying 
experience and observation with levels of psychological problems among adolescents.
Conclusion : The 3-month rate of cyberbullying experience and observation among urban 
adolescents aged 11–14 was low. However, current coping strategies against cyberbullying 
were not sufficient. Family support is an important factor that should be considered for 
designing interventions to mitigating the impacts of cyberbullying on the mental health 
of adolescents.

Cyberbullying has been well-documented as a global public 
health problem. Cyberbullying includes acts such as posting 
publicly available information on the Internet, being called or 
receiving messages that threaten or being harassed on the Internet, 
and others ( Patchin and Hinduja, 2006 ). Compared with traditional 
bullying, cyberbullying can occur every time and everywhere, 
and the identity of the perpetrator may not be disclosed ( Patchin 
and Hinduja, 2006 ). Therefore, cyberbullying may be  more 
frequent and have more serious consequences for the victim. 
Studies show that cyberbullying significantly affects adolescents, 
such as increasing the risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal 
ideation ( Klomek et  al., 2010 ; Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 
2014 ; Fahy et  al., 2016 ; Pabian and Vandebosch, 2016 ; Yuchang 
et  al., 2019 ), as well as causing physical and psychosomatic 
problems such as difficulty sleeping, headache, and loss of appetite 
(Beckman et al., 2012 ; Schneider et al., 2012 ; Schultze-Krumbholz 
et  al., 2012 ; Kowalski and Limber, 2013 ). Cyberbullying is also 
associated with the onset of substance use, traditional and 
cyberbullying perpetration, and delinquency ( Mitchell et  al., 
2007 ; Wong et  al., 2014 ; Chan and Wong, 2020 ; Estévez et  al., 
2020 ). These consequences have been observed in all perpetrators, 
victims, and observers of cyberbullying ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; 
Wong et  al., 2014 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ).
Cyberbullying among adolescents is a prevalent phenomenon 
across nations. A prior systematic review showed that 20 to 
40% of adolescents experienced cyberbullying at least once in 
their lifetime ( Aboujaoude et  al., 2015 ), and this rate tends to 
increase with increasing Internet and social media accessibility 
(Hamm et al., 2015 ). In the United States, the rate of adolescents 
who were victims of cyberbullying was from 3 to 72% ( Selkie 
et  al., 2016 ). A study conducted in seven European countries 
showed that 13.3–37.3% of adolescents aged 14–17  years were 
victims of cyberbullying ( Athanasiou et  al., 2018 ). In the Asian 
region, a review in Chinese populations revealed different 
prevalence of cyberbullying victimization in adolescents, ranging 
at 14–57% in mainland China, 13–35% in Taiwan, and 12–72% 
in Hong Kong ( Chan and Wong, 2015 ). In Korea, 14.6% adolescents 
were cyberbullying victims ( Lee and Shin, 2017 ). Coping strategies 
when having cyberbullying experience may vary and can 
be  classified into four groups: (1) directly reacting against 
cyberbullying acts (such as retaliation or constructive feedback); 
(2) ignoring the cyberbullying behaviors (such as avoidance or 
doing nothing), (3) seeking support from other sources (such 
as parents, friends, or teachers), and (4) utilizing technological 
solutions (such as blocking senders; Perren et al., 2012 ). A study 
in Hong Kong indicated that older male adolescents were more 
likely to have an active approach to cope with cyberbullying 
such as informing to adults, parents, or teachers; while adolescents, 
having limited experience with their schools, tended to have 
avoid (e.g., ignore the cyberbullying behaviors) approaches ( Chan 
and Wong, 2017 ). Another study in Czech adolescents found 
that technological strategies were the most common, following 
by avoidance and finding support ( Machackova et  al., 2013 ).
The proliferation of cyberbullying requires accelerating efforts 
to explore approaches to prevent and mitigate its consequences. Global studies showed that social support is an essential component 
in protecting adolescents from the consequences of traditional 
bullying ( Kochenderfer-Ladd and Skinner, 2002 ; Davidson and 
Demaray, 2007 ; Rothon et  al., 2011 ). Social support refers to 
instrumental support (such as providing the victim with helpful 
solutions or resources) or emotional support (such as spiritual 
encouragement, belongingness, or value recognition; House et al., 
1988 ; Kerres Malecki and Kilpatrick Demaray, 2002 ). In literature, 
many studies have shown that family and friends support can 
play an important role in protecting adolescents from becoming 
victims of cyberbullying ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ; Fanti et  al., 
2012 ; Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). In addition, adolescents who are 
of school age can get help from teachers. Previous research has 
shown that victims and perpetrators of cyber-violence possibly 
knew each other at school, and parents, friends, and teachers 
are important sources of information and support for teens 
dealing with cyberbullying ( Slonje and Smith, 2008 ).
Although many studies showed that social support helps 
to prevent cyberbullying among adolescents, its effectiveness 
in minimizing the psychological consequences of cyberbullying 
among victims or observers has been in debate. An earlier 
study found that support from friends alone was effective in 
reducing psychological problems among victims of cyberbullying 
(Holt and Espelage, 2007 ). Another research found that both 
support from family and friends played an important role in 
preventing victims from the mental consequences of cyberbullying 
(Rothon et al., 2011 ). These results concluded that social support 
held the potential for minimizing the cyberbullying-related 
psychological problems in youths. However, the evidence for 
this effect in different population groups (such as victims, 
perpetrators, or observers) is limited.
In Vietnam, evidence about cyberbullying among adolescents 
as well as the impact of social support on cyberbullying is 
currently limited. Only one previous study was conducted on 
215 adolescents and youths aged 13–18  in Hanoi, Vietnam, to 
measure the cyberbullying experience in these groups ( Chi et al., 
2020 ). By using the modified Patchin and Hinduja’s scale, this 
study found that 45.1% of sample had experienced cyberbullying 
at least once, with being called by names as the most typical 
form ( Chi et  al., 2020 ). The common responses to cyberbullies 
included ignoring cyberbullying behaviors and not telling family 
or teacher ( Chi et  al., 2020 ). To date, none of the studies were 
conducted about the mediation effect of social support on mental 
disorders in adolescents who were victims or observers of 
cyberbullying. Therefore, our study was conducted to examine 
the experience of adolescents aged 11–14  in urban Vietnam, 
determine how they coped with this issue, and explore the 
preventive mediation effect of social support to the associations 
between cyberbullying and mental health issues.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Theoretical Framework
In this study, we  employed stress buffering hypothesis  
(Cohen and Wills, 1985 ), which perceived social support that could  
mediate the relationship between stressors (i.e., cyberbullying in  Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  3 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919this case) and their negative consequences (i.e., mental 
problems). In other words, a higher level of social support 
could more weaken this relationship. Cohen and Wills in 
their study suggested that social support could diminish 
people’s perceptions about the threat of given stressors, or 
offer coping options or other necessary resources to individuals 
against the stressors ( Cohen and Wills, 1985 ). Via literature 
review, we  hypothesized that support from family, peers, 
and teachers might play a buffering role in mediating the 
effect of cyberbullying experience on the mental health of 
adolescents ( Holt and Espelage, 2007 ; Rothon et  al., 2011 ). 
Therefore, we  examined the direct effect of cyberbullying 
experience on adolescents’ mental health, as well as the 
indirect effect of social support in buffering relationships 
between cyberbullying and mental health.
Study Design
Data of this paper were collected through a cross-sectional study 
conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam, from January to September 2020. 
Four secondary schools were randomly selected in this study 
from a list of secondary schools in Hanoi. The school principal 
and teachers were approached by the research team and informed 
of the research content. The questionnaire used in this study was 
submitted to them for approval before implementing data collection.
Participants included students aged 11–14  years, attending 
four selected secondary schools; and they, as well as their 
parents and teachers, agreed to be  enrolled in the study. This 
study used a formula to estimate a population proportion with 
specified relative precision to calculate the essential sample, 
with p = 0.45 (according to previous research in Hanoi, Vietnam; 
Chi et  al., 2020 ); confidence level α  =  0.05; relative precision 
ɛ  =  0.2. The sample size needed for a school was 118 students 
or 472 students/4 schools. An additional 10% sample size was 
added to prevent participants from dropout or nonresponse, 
resulting in 520 students (or 130 students per school) being 
invited to respond to questions about cyberbullying.
A multi-stage sampling method was applied. First, the 
research team randomly selected two classes in each grade of 
each school, resulting in 32 classes being selected for the 
sample. Next, in these 32 classes, 520 students were randomly 
selected to participate in the cyberbullying survey. There were 
36 students who did not agree to participate, leading to a 
total of 484 students (response rate of 93.1%). These students, 
along with their parents or guardians, were provided written 
informed consent with brief information about research 
objectives, eligible criteria, research process, and benefits and 
requirements during study participation. This research protocol 
has been approved by the institutional review board of Hanoi 
Medical University (Code 22NCS17/HDDDDHYHN).
Data Collection and Measurement
Students participating in this study were asked to complete 
an anonymous survey questionnaire. The research team 
directly distributed the questionnaires to students. During 
the survey, parents, teachers, and unselected students did 
not present at the site of the survey to avoid their influence on the participants’ responses. Each student spent 15–20 min 
completing the questionnaire. A structured questionnaire 
was used for this study. The content of the questionnaire 
was developed under the guidance of child violence experts. 
The questionnaires were pretested on 10 adolescents to 
ensure understandability, expression, and logic, which aimed 
to avoid misunderstanding or confusion to study participants.
Variables
Cyberbullying Experience/Bystander and Coping 
Strategies
In this study, we  used the Cyberbullying Test instrument to 
identify the individual’s experience and observation of 
cyberbullying ( Garaigordobil, 2017 ). Originally, this tool asked 
participants to answer 45 items about 15 cyberbullying acts in 
three roles (15 items per role): perpetrators, victims, and observers. 
Examples of items in the instrument included the following: 
“Have they ever sent you  offensive and insulting messages by 
cellphone or Internet?” “Have you  ever received offensive and 
insulting calls on your cellphone or by Internet (Skype …)?” 
“Have you  ever been assaulted to tape the assault and hang it 
on the Internet?” Each question had four options about from 
0 “never” to 3 “always. ” In this study, we  used only two parts 
of the instrument: for victims and observers (or bystanders). 
Moreover, in the pilot, we  observed that it was difficult for our 
participants (i.e., secondary school students) to respond to the 
questions with these four options. Thus, we decided to ask them 
a series of yes/no questions to determine whether they experienced 
cyberbullying acts as victims and observers in the last 3 months. 
This recall duration was applied to minimize the potential recall 
bias. Participants were categorized into “Cyberbullying experience” 
or “Cyberbullying observation” if they reported “yes” for at least 
one cyberbullying act. The Cronbach alpha values of “Cyberbullying 
experience” and “Cyberbullying observation” items were 0.8830 
and 0.8993, respectively.
In this study, for people experiencing cyberbullying, we asked 
them to recall the impacts of these cyberbullying acts, coping 
strategies against cyberbullying, supporters when facing 
cyberbullying, and reasons for not reporting cyberbullying 
experience. Meanwhile, for those ever observing cyberbullying 
acts, participants were asked to report their reactions toward 
these behaviors. These reactions were classified into three groups: 
“Intervene, ” “Ignore, ” and “Join in. ”
- “Intervene” included (1) “oppose acts of cyberbullying, ” (2) 
“try to help or comfort the victim, ” and (3) “report online 
violence to people able to help the victim (e.g., teachers 
and parents). ”
- “Ignore” included “leaving cyberspace. ”
- “Join in” included “Encouraging cyberbullying behaviors” and 
“Enjoys cyberbullying acts, and wants to learn more, but 
does not participate or promote publicly. ”
In addition, we  asked them to explain the reasons if they 
did not report the observed cyberbullying acts. We  also asked 
all participants to express their attitude toward cyberbullying 
by asking them a question: “What extend do you  agree or Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  4 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919disagree with cyberbullying?” The students rated their attitude 
with an 11-point Likert scale from 0 “Totally agree” to 10 
“Total disagree. ”
Psychological Problems
To evaluate the psychological problems, the Depression, Anxiety, 
and Stress Scale—21 Items (DASS-21) was utilized. This 
instrument included 21 items regarding depression (seven items, 
range score 0–21), anxiety (seven items, range score 0–21), 
and stress symptoms (seven items, range score 0–21) in the 
last 7 days ( Le et al., 2017 ). Examples of items in the instrument 
included the following: “I found it hard to wind down” (stress 
domain), “I was aware of dryness of my mouth” (anxiety 
domain), and “I could not seem to experience any positive 
feeling at all” (depression domain; Lovibond and Lovibond, 
1996 ). Participants responded to each item on a four-point 
Likert scale from 0 “Did not apply to me at all” to 3 “ Applied 
to me very much or most of the time” ( Le et  al., 2017 ). A 
higher score in each part indicated a higher severity of this 
psychological problem. The Vietnamese version of this instrument 
had been validated elsewhere ( Le et  al., 2017 ). The Cronbach 
alpha of this instrument was 0.8523.
Social Support
Support from family (two items), peer (two items), and teacher 
(three items) was measured by using seven items, as below:
 1. My parents do not understand me or care about my feelings.
 2. My parents do not listen to me or do not pay attention 
to the problems I  have.
 3. My classmates are very friendly.
 4. My classmates respect me and listen to my opinion.
 5. My teachers help me when I’m sad or having problems.
 6. My teachers take care of me and support me in achieving 
the best results.
 7. My teachers respect me and listen to me.
Students rated each item on a five-point Likert scale from 
1 “Totally disagree” to 5 “Totally agree. ” The score of each 
domain was computed by dividing the total scores of items 
in this domain by the number of items. Scores of questions 
1 and 2 were reversed before computing the score of parental 
support. The score of each domain was from 1 to 5, with a 
greater score meaning a higher level of support. The Cronbach 
alpha of this instrument was 0.8205.
Sociodemographic Characteristics
In this part, we collected data about age, gender (male/female), 
and type of family (nuclear/multi-generations/others).
Statistical Analysis
A p-value of <0.05 was used to detect a statistical significance. 
Stata 16.0 software was used for analyzing data. A listwise 
deletion approach was applied to handle missing data. 
Descriptive statistics were performed for all variables of interest. 
Statistical tests including chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests were used to examine the difference between sociodemographic 
characteristics, social support, cyberbullying attitude, and 
psychological problems between cyberbullying experience/
non-experience and cyberbullying observation/non-observation. 
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify 
the factors associated with cyberbullying experience (yes = 1/
no  =  0, model 1) and cyberbullying observation (yes  =  1/
no  =  0, model 2). Independent variables included 
sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and types of 
the family), support from family/peer/teachers, cyberbullying 
attitude, cyberbullying experience (for model 2), and 
cyberbullying observation (for model 1). Moreover, among 
those ever observing cyberbullying acts in the last 3  months 
(n  =  136), we  performed the multivariate logistic regression 
models to determine factors that were related to “Intervene” 
(yes  =  1/no  =  0, model 3) or “Ignore” (yes  =  1/no  =  0, 
model 4) behaviors. Independent variables for models 3 and 
4 included sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, and 
types of the family), support from family/peer/teachers, 
cyberbullying attitude, and cyberbullying experience. We  did 
not perform the regression analysis for the “Join in” outcome 
because only nine students had these behaviors, which might 
not be  a large enough sample size for the analysis.
Finally, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to 
examine the mediation effects of family, peer, and teacher 
support on the relationships between cyberbullying experience/
observation and psychological problems. The roles of 
cyberbullying (cyberbullying experience and observation) were 
coded as binary variables (yes = 1, no = 0), while the depression, 
anxiety, and stress variables were treated as continuous variables. 
The mean- and variance-adjusted maximum likelihood test 
statistic (MLMV) was performed for the SEM, given its robustness 
for data with non-normal distribution ( Maydeu-Olivares, 2017 ). 
Multiple goodness-of-fit indices, including the root-mean-square 
error of approximation (RMSEA), the comparative fit index 
(CFI), and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) 
were examined. RMSEA lower than 0.08, SRMR lower than 
0.08, and CFI higher than 0.09 were considered acceptable 
model fits ( Kline, 2015 ).
Ethical Approval
Given highly sensitive information collected from adolescents, 
we  performed the following actions to ensure the rights and 
benefits of participants. First, we  provided an information 
package to students and their parents/guardians before the 
survey implementation. This package had detailed information 
about the purposes of the study, study designs, eligible criteria, 
rights, and benefits of study participants. It was also emphasized 
in the information package that the participation of students 
was voluntary and that relationships between the students and 
teachers/schools would not be  affected in any way if they did 
not participate in the survey. No individual data were collected 
to protect students’ privacy; thus, it was impossible to re-identify 
the participants based on the current dataset. Students and 
their caregivers were also informed that they could skip any 
questions that they felt uncomfortable or they could withdraw 
from the study at any time. We  offered the helpline in the Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  5 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919information package for students who needed help to address 
cyberbullying-related issues. Contacts of the principal 
investigators and coordinators of this study were provided to 
answer all questions raised about the study.
RESULTS
The characteristics of participants are presented in Table  1 . 
Among 484 secondary school students, the mean age was 
12.6 ( SD  =  1.2) years. There were 11.6 and 28.3% of students 
reporting that they experienced and observed at least one 
cyberbullying act in the last 3  months, respectively. No 
difference was observed regarding gender, age, and type of 
family between those with and without cyberbullying experience 
(p > 0.05). Meanwhile, the rate of females in the cyberbullying 
observation group (68.6%) was significantly higher than that 
in the non-cyberbullying observation (56.2%). A significant 
age difference was also found between these two groups 
(p  <  0.001).
Table  1  also reveals that people who experienced 
cyberbullying showed significantly lower levels of attitude 
against cyberbullying ( p = 0.022) and lower levels of perceived 
family ( p  <  0.001) and teachers support ( p  =  0.007), but a 
higher level of perceived peer support ( p = 0.005) and higher depression ( p  <  0.001), anxiety ( p  <  0.001), and stress scores 
(p  <  0.001) than did those not experiencing cyberbullying. 
These differences were also observed between participants 
with and without cyberbullying observation ( p < 0.05), except 
for the level of cyberbullying attitude.
Figure  1  illustrates the 3-month rate of each cyberbullying 
behavior in terms of experience and observation. “Stole password 
to prevent access to blog/email” was the most common behavior 
when 6.6 and 18.4% of participants ever experienced and 
observed this behavior, respectively. “Received offensive & 
insulting messages on cellphone/by Internet” and “Slandered 
through the Internet, telling lies or spread rumors” were the 
second and third most common acts.
Among participants experiencing cyberbullying as victims, 
Table  2  indicates that 26.8% of students felt anxiety and fear 
and did not want to be  close to anyone. Over 21% of victims 
had reduced study performance, 12.5% had suicidal ideation, 
and even 10.7% had suicidal attempts. However, only 48.2% 
tried to stop the perpetrators, and 35.7% told this experience 
to their friends. None of them told teachers, parents, or relatives. 
“Try to cope by myself, ” “I think my parents, teachers or 
adults do not understand or believe me, ” and “I think there’s 
nothing my parents, teachers or adults can do to help me” 
were the three most common reasons for not reporting 
cyberbullying acts among victims.

grouped into the “Intervene” category; 56 students (40.9%) 
and nine students (6.6%) were classified into “Ignore” and 
“Join in” categories, respectively (one student could do more 
than one act toward cyberbullying observation). Being afraid 
of having limited use of the Internet if they reported cyberbullying 
behaviors, thinking that adults did not understand or believe, 
and thinking that adults could not do anything for victims 
were the three most popular reasons for not reporting the 
cyberbullying behaviors among observers ( Table  3 ).
Table  4  shows associated factors with cyberbullying 
experience and observation. Cyberbullying experience was 
only found to be  associated with cyberbullying observation 
(OR  =  5.86, 95% CI  =  3.06–11.21). Meanwhile, being female 
and of higher age were positively related to cyberbullying 
observation, whereas having a higher level of support from 
family (OR  =  0.76, 95% CI  =  0.61–0.94) was negatively 
associated with the cyberbullying observation.
In regression analysis, only cyberbullying attitude was found 
to be  associated with “intervene” behaviors (OR  =  1.53, 95% 
CI  =  1.10–2.12). Participants having a higher level of peer 
support were more likely to ignore the cyberbullying acts 
(OR  =  1.78, 95% CI  =  1.08–2.93), while those having a higher 
level of teacher support were less likely to ignore these acts 
(OR  =  0.64, 95% CI  =  0.42–0.98; Table  5 ).
The SEM is illustrated in Figure  2 . The goodness-of-fit 
indices were acceptable with RMSEA  =  0.052, CFI  =  0.983, 
and SRMR  =  0.026. The model shows that only cyberbullying 
experience showed a significantly positive direct effect on 
psychological problems. The cyberbullying experience group 
was significantly related to family and peer support, while the 
cyberbullying observation group was only significantly associated with family support. Only family support showed to be negatively 
associated with psychological problems, whereas peer and teacher 
support showed positive relations with psychological problems.
Table  6  determines the mediation or indirect effects of 
different types of support. For both cyberbullying experience 
and observation, only family support was found to partially 
mediate associations between cyberbullying experience and 
observation with levels of psychological problems among our 
participants. Regarding cyberbullying experience, the indirect 
effect of family support accounted for 18.3% of the total effect 
and 22.4% of the direct effect. Meanwhile, regarding cyberbullying 
observation, this indirect effect accounted for 32.5% of the 
total effect and 48.1% of the direct effect.
DISCUSSION
Our study contributed to the current literature about the 
experience and coping strategies of adolescents toward 
cyberbullying and the potential effects of different support to 
mitigate the psychological consequence of cyberbullying. Our 
study suggested a low rate of cyberbullying experience and 
observation in secondary school students, as well as a high 
risk of psychological problems among those experiencing 
cyberbullying. Moreover, family support was an important 
protective source and helped mediate the relationship between 
cyberbullying and psychological problems.
The rate of adolescents involving in cyberbullying as victims 
over the past 3  months in our study was low, according to 
the self-report information from the participants. This rate 
was much lower than previous research in Hanoi, Vietnam, 
which showed that 45.1% of adolescents aged 13–18 were 
FIGURE 1 |  The 3-month rates of different cyberbullying behaviors in the study population ( n = 484).Ngo et al. Cyberbullying in AdolescentsFrontiers in Psychology  | www.frontiersin.org  7 April 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 661919victims of cyberbullying in the past 12 months ( Chi et al., 2020 ). 
Our result was equivalent to a previous study in the United States 
with 11% of adolescents who studied grades 6 to 8 being 
bullied online in the past 2  months ( Kowalski and Limber, 
2007 ). Overall, the estimated prevalence of cyberbullying varied 
significantly between different studies and countries due to 
the difference of cyberbullying definition, time frame, and 
methods of measurement ( Berne et  al., 2013 ; Selkie et  al., 
2016 ; Brochado et  al., 2017 ), which results in the problematic 
study comparisons. Indeed, using the Cyberbullying Test, which 
was a valid scale to measure cyberbullying ( Garaigordobil, 
2017 ), was advantageous to our study compared with other 
prior research. This measure contains 15 cyberbullying behaviors, 
enabling us to capture more comprehensive aspects that 
participants might suffer or observe during the recall period 
than other previous studies ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ; Livazović 
and Ham, 2019 ; Chi et  al., 2020 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ).
Notably, our results showed that though the impact of 
cyberbullying was significant, the proportion of participants 
taking specific actions against cyberbullying was not high. In 
addition to the impact on academic performance, there was 
a high proportion of individuals who experienced cyberbullying suffering the negative psychological effects such as anxiety, 
fear, and even suicidal thoughts. This was similar to previous 
studies showing the serious consequences of cyberbullying on 
the lives of victims ( Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 2014 ). 
Nonetheless, the findings showed that only nearly 50% of the 
victims tried to stop this act of the perpetration, and 33.9% TABLE 2 |  Impacts, reactions, supporters, and reasons for not reporting

shared with friends about the issue of cyberbullying but did 
not share it with parents or teachers. The most common reasons 
for not sharing with parents or teachers were because the 
adolescents were afraid that the adults did not believe or the 
adults will not be  able to do anything for the adolescents. 
Another reason was that the victims wanted to solve this 
problem themselves. In a previous study in Vietnam, it was 
found that ignoring this behavior and blocking the perpetrator’s 
account were the two most common measures (58.8 and 54.6%, 
respectively; Chi et  al., 2020 ). However, problems caused by 
cyberbullying were not easy to deal with because these behaviors 
can occur at any time and can reach large numbers of audiences in  a short period of time ( Patchin and Hinduja, 2006 ), causing 
a feeling of stigma and isolation among victims ( Bossler et  al., 
2012 ; Burton et  al., 2013 ) and, in turn, worsening the 
consequences of cyberbullying. Therefore, equipping adolescents 
with appropriate coping strategies against cyberbullying is 
essential and should be  prioritized in school and family.
Our study also examined the rate of cyberbullying observers 
among adolescents and identified how they reacted to 
cyberbullying behaviors. As expected, we found that the majority 
of observers were in the group “Intervene” who responded to 
the cyberbullying acts by reporting these behaviors or helping 
victims. This result was similar to the study in Thailand showing 
that most observers belonged to the “Intervene” group 
(Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ). However, our study was different 
from study results in Belgium, where the authors show that 
most adolescents belonged to the “Ignore” group when observing 
cyberbullying behaviors ( Van Cleemput et al., 2014 ). We assumed 
that the cultural factors might be attributable to this difference. 
While the Western culture highlighted individualism, the Asian 
culture emphasized the role of collectivism, which might motivate 
them to help others when they faced problems ( Sittichai and 
Smith, 2015 ). On the other hand, similar to the victim group, 
the main reasons that participants in the observer group did 
not report violent cyber behavior included (1) being afraid of 
limited Internet use and (2) believing that adults were unable 
to address this issue. This result suggested a huge gap in the 
relationships between parent-teacher and adolescents, especially 
among cyberbullying victims or observers. Interestingly, results 
of the multivariate models indicated an opposite trend between 
peer and teacher support, when higher peer and teacher support 
were associated with higher and lower likelihoods of being 
“Ignore” people. This phenomenon could be  justified that 
adolescents’ peers might not perceive this issue as a problem 
as adults did (i.e., parents and teachers; Slonje and Smith, 2008 ). TABLE 5 |  Associated factors with different types of cyberbullying observation.

they could not provide adequate support due to the lack of 
knowledge and resource needed. Therefore, instead of 
recommending interventions on the issue, they were more likely 
to advise to ignore cyberbullying behaviors. It should be  noted 
that the attitude against cyberbullying played an important role 
among adolescents in the “Intervene” group. This finding was 
consistent with previous studies on both cyberbullying and 
traditional bullying ( Y ang and Kim, 2017 ; Panumaporn et  al., 
2020 ). Therefore, campaigns to motivate adolescents to intervene 
in cyberbullying are critical to diminish this behavior and 
its impacts.
The findings of this study echoed previous evidence showing 
that cyberbullying experience was associated with psychological 
problems ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; Schneider et  al., 2012 ; Nixon, 
2014 ; Wong et  al., 2014 ; Panumaporn et  al., 2020 ). Moreover, 
our study underlined the protective mediation effects of family 
support on the association between cyberbullying experience 
and observation with psychological issues. Unlike traditional 
bullying where parent, friend, and teacher support helped to 
mitigate the impact of bullying acts on victims’ lives and mental 
health ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ; Fanti et  al., 2012 ; Hellfeldt 
et  al., 2019 ), in our study, friend and teacher support did not 
buffer against the psychological problems among cyberbullying 
victims and/or observers. In literature, adolescents are concerned 
that sharing their experience with the teacher was an ineffective 
strategy ( Price and Dalgleish, 2010 ), and reporting the problem 
to their parents could hinder their freedom in Internet use (Hoff Dianne and Mitchell Sidney, 2009 ). However, in a previous 
survey in Sweden, parent and teacher support was found to 
buffer against depressive and anxiety symptoms in cyberbullying 
victims and bully victims ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). Another 
longitudinal study found that adolescents who were victims 
of cyberbullying had lower levels of depressive symptoms if 
they had family support ( Machmutow et al., 2012 ). As discussed 
above, we believed that parents could offer appropriate emotional 
support to help adolescents in controlling the psychological 
distress caused by cyberbullying behaviors ( Livazović and Ham, 
2019 ). Moreover, they may be more likely to perceive accurately 
the problem of cyberbullying, while friends might not fully 
recognize the trouble of cyberbullying involvement, resulting 
in the provision of inadequate support ( Slonje and Smith, 
2008 ). This result is critical since most of the victims in our 
study sought help from friends rather than their parents. Thus, 
parents should be  proactive in building a strong bond with 
their children ( Nixon, 2014 ; Slonje et  al., 2017 ). On the other 
hand, our finding partially affirmed that peer support might 
not be  the best focus to address cyberbullying and its 
consequence ( Hellfeldt et  al., 2019 ). However, further 
longitudinal studies should be  performed to test the effect of 
peer support on buffering the relationship between cyberbullying 
and psychological impairment in different contexts.
The current study indicated several implications. First, 
educational campaigns should be performed to raise adolescents, 
parents, and teachers’ awareness and attitude toward 
cyberbullying, motivating them to become involved to intervene 
and prevent cyberbullying behaviors. The contents of these 
interventions should include knowledge and practices on 
cyberbullying, communication and Internet use skills, and 
prosocial behaviors, empathy, and coping strategies with 
cyberbullying ( Hutson et  al., 2018 ). Regular training sessions 
should be  performed to help adolescents in acquiring skills 
and abilities to actively cope with cyberbullying, help other 
victims, and prevent them from joining in cyberbullying. 
Previous studies found that active strategies to cope with 
cyberbullying victimization were effective to address the 
cyberbullying-related issues ( Ybarra et  al., 2007 ; Riebel et  al., 
2009 ; Chan and Wong, 2017 ). Second, according to the study, 
leaders in schools and communities should implement activities 
that increase parents’ roles in addressing cyberbullying and 
its consequences among adolescents. Positive parent-children 
relationships could encourage adolescents to find support when 
dealing with difficult situations ( Chan and Chui, 2015 ; Chan 
and Wong, 2017 ). Finally, given that cyberbullying is an emerging 
problem but school regulations for this issue do not exist in 
Vietnam, current policies should consider this type of bullying 
and its impact, especially among adolescents.
Interpretation of the study results should be done cautiously 
with the following limitations. First, given that cyberbullying 
is a sensitive issue, relying on only self-reports from participants 
may underestimate the actual rates of cyberbullying in 
adolescents. In literature, approaches that used information 
from multiple sources such as peers and teachers would 
be  recommended ( Brochado et  al., 2017 ). Further studies 
that involve multiple reporters to measure the prevalence of TABLE 6 |  Standardized indirect effects of cyberbullying experience and

the cross-sectional design, which limited our ability to establish 
the causal associations. Thus, conclusions about the associations 
and effects in this study cannot be  definitely drawn. Future 
studies should use longitudinal designs to investigate the 
influence of cyberbullying and social support on psychological 
well-being in middle school adolescents. Third, the rate of 
cyberbullying experience and observation was low, resulting 
in a small sample size for statistical tests. Moreover, we  used 
a modified instrument to measure cyberbullying experience 
rather than use the original one, which might underestimate 
or overestimate the rate of cyberbullying victimization and 
observation. Finally, other characteristics such as traditional 
bullying exposure, the Internet or social media use, and 
cyberbullying perpetration were not fully investigated. These 
factors were found to be  associated with cyberbullying 
victimization in previous work ( Beckman et  al., 2012 ; 
Athanasiou et  al., 2018 ; Chi et  al., 2020 ). Hence, further 
studies should be  elucidated to measure these relationships 
between these factors and cyberbullying experience.
CONCLUSION
Our study suggested that the 3-month rate of cyberbullying 
experience and observation among urban adolescents aged 
11–14  in Vietnam was low. However, current coping strategies 
against cyberbullying in this group were not sufficient. Family 
support is an important factor that should be  considered for 
designing interventions to mitigate the impacts of cyberbullying 
on the mental health of adolescents.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

 The purpose of this study was to examine preschool teachers and parents’ attitudes 
and their practices regarding the use of digital technol ogies during preschool 
education. The main research questions the study intended to address focused on 
teachers’ and parents’ attitudes and practices about the role of digital technology 
supplies in young children’s development. The study used a mixed rese arch 
approach, using in -depth interviews and an online questionnaire. The results have 
shown that only one of the eight preschool teachers reported a positive attitude 
regarding the impact of digital technology in children’s development. Most of the 
interv iewed preschool teachers showed preference towards authentic play and 
activities exercising children’s psycho -motor skills. However, most of parents have 
suggested that their children, starting from early years of their development, are 
exposed to differen t digital technologies. In conclusion, there are two contradictory 
findings (progressive and regressive philosophies) among parents and preschool 
teachers regarding their perceptions and practices on the use of digital technologies 
in young children’s lear ning and development. The study advocates for continuous 
cooperation between parents and teachers to ensure prospects of maximizing 
benefits and alleviating potential risks of using digital technologies in early 
childhood education.

International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 INTRODUCTION  
Technology plays a crucial role in children and adults’ everyday lives. There are 
numerous studies showing that the use of digital technology, from different user groups, 
is increasing ev ery day. However, studies also show that there are different perceptions 
regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the use of digital technology children, 
especially during their early ages of development.  
Information and Communications Technology ( hereafter  ICT) can be defined as 
“anything which allows us to get information, to communicate with each other, or to 
have an effect on the environment using electronic or digital equipment” (Bolstad, 2004) 
However, according to Kalas (2010) , in early childh ood education literature ( hereafter  
ECE), the concept of ICT includes computer hardware and software, digital cameras and 
video cameras, the Internet, telecommunication tools, programmable toys, and many 
other devices and resources.   
In many countries, EC E or preschool education is conceptualized differently. This study 
focuses on preschool education, i.e. the years before children attend elementary school. 
In Kosovo, the Law on Pre -university education requires children to enrol in elementary 
school at si x years old. Therefore, the study concentrates on perceptions on the use of 
technology during children development before the age of six, known as preschool age 
as defined by the Kosovo Curriculum Framework (MEST, 2016). In addition, the study 
focuses on t he use of digital technology at early childhood institutions and their home. 
Early childhood education policies and practice itself in Kosovo has been a great 
challenge for the overall educational policies. According to a study report published by 
the “Kos ovo Education and Employment Network – KEEN” project,  the inclusion of 
children in institutionalized pre -school education in Kosovo continues to be a challenge 
given that by 2017, according to data from the Education Management information 
System (EMIS), t here are only 42 public kindergartens and 88 licensed private 
institutions, 5 which are community -based (Gjelaj, Rraci & Bajrami, 2018).  As a result, 
Kosovo remains the country with the lowest inclusion of children in preschool 
education, aged 0 to 4 years  old, in the region, with an inclusion rate of 4.5%. The 
highest inclusion rate is in pre -primary classes (aged 5 to 6), where 76.27% of children 
are involved (Ibid).  
Despite this current situation the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan (KESP), (2017 -2021) 
under the strategic objective ‘teaching and learning’, plans to maximize learning through 
quality teaching, implementing competency -based curricula, and by using high -quality 
teaching resources. The implementation of the new curriculum in all schools is 
understood as central to improving the quality of learning in Kosovo. In addition to 
teacher training, this requires the preparation of textbooks and other teaching and 
learning materials, including electronic teaching materials that are in harmony with the 
Kosovo Curriculum Framework (KCF). This also assumes that special attention should 
be paid to providing schools with ICT equipment, as well as other teaching support.  
However, two important stakeholders in early childhood development, teachers and 
parents, have opposing opinions regarding the use of digital technology in education.  Gjelaj, Buza, Shatri & Zabeli       167 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 The purpose of this study is to analyze teacher and parents’ attitudes and practices about 
the use of digital technologies during early years of education. The study aims to give 
answer to two main research questions:  
1. What are the attitudes and practices of the parents towards the use of digital 
technology during early years of children development at home?  
2. What are the attitudes and practices of preschool teachers toward the use o f 
digital technology during early years of children development in kindergarten 
education?  
LITERATURE REVIEW  
Historically, theorists and researchers have debated whether young children should use 
technology at school (Alper, 2011; Blackwell, 2013; Cordes &  Miller, 2000; Kirkorian, 
Wartella, & Anderson, 2008; House, 2012; Lindahl & Folkesson, 2012; Morgan, 2010, 
Parett, Quesenberry & Blum, 2010; Plowman & McPake, 2013 at Zomer and Kay, 
2016). Various authors have expressed the view that computer/ICT use is n ot 
appropriate for young children’s cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development. 
However, there is no clear evidence to support this claim, and this view has increasingly 
been replaced by the view that, when used appropriately, ICT can be a usef ul tool for 
supporting young children’s learning and development (Bolstad, 2004) . There are 
diverse attitudes presented from different stakeholders when discussing early years of 
children development and the use of digital technology.  
Today, it is common to observe  toddlers and preschool children watching videos, 
playing games on tablets, or exploring on the internet. With such dynamic 
developments, there is a need to establish a better understanding of the process of 
engaging ICT in everyday play and learning activ ities of preschool children. Several 
recent research findings pointed out the extraordinary potential of ICT to enhance the 
learning and other developmental processes of children (Kalas, 2013). According to 
Kalas (2013), studies have shown that digital tec hnologies can provide children with 
new opportunities to engage in attractive and relevant play, learning, communication, 
exploration, and development. Properly integrated digital tools can empower younger 
children by providing them with a voice, especiall y with limited literacy capabilities, at 
their young age (U.S. Department of Education, 2016). Digital technologies as digital 
toys which are properly integrated in learning can empower children by granting them a 
voice they have never had before. In this context, digital technologies also open new 
pathways for alternative social interactions and change the learning relationships 
between children and teachers (UNESCO, 2012) . 
Hayes and Whitbread (2006) examined a holistic development of young children’s 
learning and identified seven different ways that learning could be enhanced by 
integrating ICT, namely, (a) ICT and literacy; (b) ICT and mathematical understanding; 
(c) ICT and science; (d) creativity, problem solving, and playful use of technology; (e) 
visual literacy and painting; (f) media education (digital animation); and (g) learning of 
music. Results of the interviews with teachers and parents as shown by the study of 
Ihmeideh & Alkhawaldeh (2017) have indicated a clear perpetuation of the role of 168                                Digital Technologies in Early Childhood: Attitudes and  … 
 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 technology and digital media in the intellectual, religious, and moral aspects due to the 
contributions of these aspects to children's learning and development. Based on Byron 
(2008), New Zealand Council for Educational Research (2004), and Stephen & 
Plowman ( 2002), most of the concerns fall into one of four categories: (a) harmful 
physical effects; (b) children’s learning, cognitive, social, and emotional development; 
(c) exposure to harmful contents; and (d) new technologies displacing other important 
learnin g and play activities. However, nowadays, it is almost impossible to come across 
an educational institution without an ICT presence.  
In early childhood education, the term ICTs could include computers digital cameras 
and digital video cameras, creativity and communication software and tools, the internet, 
telephones, mobile telephones, tape recorders, interactive stories, computer games, 
programmable toys, videoconferencing technologies and closed -circuit television, data 
projectors, microphones, headphone s electronic whiteboards and more  (Olowe & 
Kutelu, 2014). Early childhood in -service and pre -service teachers’ views are essential 
for ICT integration in early childhood settings and studies have shown that positive 
views are crucial for influencing their decisions to use ICT in their teaching (Sime & 
Priestley, 2005) . Their views and intentions predict the integration (or lack thereof) of 
ICT in the classroom, while the successful integration will also depend on other factors 
such as appropriate skills and  training (Sime & Priestley, 2005) . Inan & Lowther (2009) 
examined the effects of teachers’ individual characteristics and perceptions of contextual 
factors that influence ICT integration in classrooms. One of the independent variables 
included in their st udy was teachers’ beliefs about technology, which was defined as the 
teachers’ perception of the influence of technology on teaching and learning practices. 
Findings showed that teachers’ computer proficiency, teachers’ overall support, 
teachers’ technical  support, and computer availability have a significant influence on 
teachers’ beliefs about technology. Also, teachers’ beliefs had a strong influence on the 
use and integration of ICT in classrooms.  
Regarding pre -service early childhood teachers , Angeli ( 2004)  showed that they are not 
free of personal beliefs about the role of ICT in early childhood settings and that they 
may also have misconceptions about the potential of ICT tools in teaching and learning. 
Although they appropriate technology in their ro le as students (e.g., to prepare lessons 
plans), they resist seeing technology as a part of their relationship with children and 
express little desire to use computers with children, as future teachers (Laffey, 2004) . 
Furthermore,  Kiridis, Tsakiridou, Kask alis, & Golia (2004)  have found that pre -service 
early childhood teachers have positive views about the use of computer in early 
childhood settings. Such views have pointed out that the use of computer enhances 
teaching, thus, computers should be used acro ss all kindergarten activities. Their 
findings have recommended the introduction and use of computers have positive 
outcomes for young children, such as: higher concentration and participation in 
educational process, enhancement of learning outcomes, and f acilitation of 
communication.  
Literature also speaks that in -service teacher training has been of informative nature and 
non-systematic  (Minaidi & Hlapanis, 2005)  and relevant courses mainly aim at the  Gjelaj, Buza, Shatri & Zabeli       169 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 development of teachers’ familiarity with ICT (use of  word processing, spreadsheet, 
presentation programs and internet). According to Gialamas & Nikolopoulou (2010),  the 
positive influence of the computer self -efficacy on views –intentions is statistically 
significant for each population, but it is stronger f or the teachers. This finding is in 
agreement with earlier studies that showed positive relationships between computers 
self-efficacy and in/pre -service early childhood teachers’ views (Chen & Chang, 2006; 
Tsitouridou & Vryzas,  2001, 2004) .  
On the contra ry to teacher’ perceptions and beliefs, parents are more opened to use 
different supplies of digital technologies and most of studies show that there is a strong 
relationship between parent’s different habits and influence to their children. Studies 
show t hat nowadays parents are not spending much quality time with their children 
while the amount of time spent by them on reading to their children is very low (Shin, 
2015; Hesketh, Hinkley & Campbell, 2012). Studies also found that parent technology 
use or at titudes toward media to be positively correlated with their children's use of 
technology . Further analyses indicate that child screen time use appears to be the result 
of an interaction between child and parent factors and is highly influenced by parental 
attitudes (Genc, 2014; McCloskey et al. 2018; Vittrup, Snider, Rose & Rippy, 2014; 
Blackwell, Lauricella & Wartella, 2014). Overall, parents showed positive attitudes 
toward media, to the extent that they believed media exposure to be vital to children’s 
development, and many disagreed with recommendations from expert sources regarding 
age-appropriate screen time (Vittrup, et al. 2014).  
STUDY CONTEXT  
The Republic of Kosovo is the newest state in Europe. It declared its independence on 
February 17th, 2008. T he total population of the Republic of Kosovo is estimated at 1.8 -
2.2 million, with ethnic Albanians comprising 88%, ethnic Serbs 7% and other ethnic 
groups 5% of the total population.  
The current education sector in Republic of Kosovo is undergoing extens ive reform 
efforts in all sub -sectors, addressing key challenges of increasing participation and 
improving equity and quality of education with limited resources. According to the 
Strategic Developing Plan of Education (2017 -2022), despite good progress in  
education reform, there are challenges to be addressed. Regarding preschool education 
system, Kosovo seems to have the lowest rate of inclusion of preschool children in 
institutionalized education. According to the Agency of Statistics in Kosovo (2017), 
there are only 42 public kindergartens in overall state. The capital of Kosovo, Prishtina 
municipality has started implementing new model of community -based kindergartens 
and it seems the best way to expand the inclusion of preschool aged children in 
educat ion.  
The National Development Strategy Plan (201 6-2021) aims at improving the quality of 
education and early childhood education is one of the priorities. The new Kosovo 
Curriculum Framework (KCF) focuses on learner -centeredness, competencies, 
integrated teaching and learning, flexibility, mobility and transparency (MEST, 2016 ).  
Overall, Kosovo is considered to have a very advanced legislation in the field of 
education (pre -primary education for children aged 5 -6 years is expected to become 170                                Digital Technologies in Early Childhood: Attitudes and  … 
 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 mandatory afte r a financial analysis done by 2015 (KOMF, 2014) . Public awareness 
about the importance of ECE has also risen due to initiatives of UNICEF, MEST, and 
numerous partner organizations. MEST has committed itself to providing improved 
access and quality educati on for all children and on all educational levels including 
Early Childhood Education (ECE). Preschool education is now part of the wider Pre -
University Strategy. During 2008, preschool sector started to acquire support by MEST 
in order to develop Early Le arning Development Standards (ELDS) for children from 
birth to 6 -year-old. The goal of the Early Learning Development Standards was to 
increase the quality of education activities in preschool education both in the family 
environment and preschool institut ions (MEST, 2011) .  
However, the Kosovo Education Strategic Plan –KESP (2017 -2021) and the document 
of Kosovo Curriculum Framework underline that in order to become successfully 
integrated into a digital economy, students need to attain digital competencies . 
Therefore, along with basic knowledge of literacy and numeracy, the current and future 
education system should stress the importance of digital awareness and literacy, so that 
full functional literacy is achieved during formal schooling  (MEST, Kosovo Edu cation 
Framework, 2016). Even though educational policies in our country prioritize the 
continuous professional development of educators and the integration of ICT at all 
levels of pre -university education and specifically in preschool institutions. This 
research contributes to enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and 
parents in harmony with Kosovo's strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in 
Early Childhood . 
METHOD  
Participants  
The sample for this study includes 8 preschool teac hers selected randomly from 7 public 
preschool institutions all over Kosovo in order to see if there are differences in 
perceptions regarding the use of digital technologies in early childhood education 
between preschool teachers working in different parts  of Kosovo. The number of 
kindergartens in the cities of Kosovo is very low, (usually there is one kindergarten in 
one city). However, the situation regarding the availability of kindergartens (public, 
private, and community based) is higher in Prishtina, the capital of Kosovo. Teachers 
involved in this study varied also in terms of age and working experience.

According to Creswell (2014), one of the mo st common probability sampling 
approaches used by researchers is random sampling, which allow representatives 
(preschool teachers and parents in this study) an equal chance of getting selected. This 
sampling strategy was purposely chosen by our group of re searchers, considering that 
topics such as the use of digital technologies in early childhood education are limited in 
the context of developing countries, such as Kosovo. Hence, this sampling strategy 
allowed our study to acquire a wide range of perceptio ns from both preschool teachers 
and parents as randomly selected the selected sample representatives, enhancing the 
value of our findings.

Instruments  
The study used both in -depth interviews and an online questionnaire to collect the data.  
In depth interviews with 8 preschool teachers where used to find out what are the 
teacher attitudes and practice s regarding use of digital supplies in preschool education 
settings. A model of in-depth  interview protocol used from Kelly (2014) was used to 
identify four dimensions of teacher attitudes toward use of digital technology, consisted 
from:  
1. Teacher previous  experience with regards to technology use,   
2. Availability of digital technologies in current workplace,  
3. Own believes about technology effects to children learning and development, and  
4. Professional development activities with regard to technology skills  
Questions about the practices of integration of technology during the classes and the 
ones that ask to describe the lessons/ activities with technology where avoided when 
teachers declared that they do not have any kind of digital technology in their 
classro oms.  
In order to collect preschool parents’  attitudes regarding the use of use of digital 
technologies in early childhood education, an open online questionnaire was distributed 
to 100 parents in October, 2017.  
The questionnaire was self -constructed and a djusted to the context. It covered main 
research questions dealing with parental attitudes and practices about:

Data Analysis  
The in -depth interviews were analyzed using content analysis (Kolbe & Burnett, 1991). 
In addition, the four dimensions  from Kelly (2014) model were used as criteria and 
guiding elements to convey many themes and discussions. The content analysis was 
followed by a descriptive statistical analysis of the online questionnaire ( Creswell, 
2014) . 
FINDINGS  
Parents Attitudes and  Practices about use of Digital Technology during Early 
Years  
According to the data, parents’ attitudes and practices about use of digital technology 
during early years can be organized into two groups. One of the groups comprises 
parents that support the idea of enabling their children to use digital technologies, such 
as TV, laptop, tablets, smart devices, computers, gaming technology (see Fig 1). The 
other group of parents represents the opinion of avoiding their children’s exposure to 
digital technologi es during their early stages of development (see Fig. 5)  
 
Figure 1  
Type of Technology Used by Children up to 5, as Reported by Parents  
The questionnaire data showed that most of the parents (66.67 %) declared positive 
towards th e use of digital technologies for their young children (ages 0 to 5). The results 
presented have indicated that most of parents grant access to TV (74.44%), smart 
phones (50.50%), and tablets (30.00%) for their young children (ages 0 to 5). Parents

International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 reporte d that they are satisﬁed with how their young children access and use technology 
at home, referring to the beneﬁts of technology use, including but not limited to a) 
learning of English language, b) acquiring technology skills, and c) general 
development. In fact, around 43 percent of parents declared they are firm believers that 
children using technology will promote their school readiness. However, around 57 
percent of them do not support this relationship.  
 
Figure 2  
Parents Perceived Beneﬁts on School Readiness   
Despite the countless benefits, parents associate technology use with socializing 
problems, too much screen time, sleeping problems, physical development delays while 
they also think that children miss outdoor play with their pe ers and they even develop 
behavioral  problems from the contact with inappropriate content such as violence and 
aggressive games.

Time Children Spend Using Technology Each Day 
The data presented in the pie chart above indicates a variation of children’s time allotted 
in front of screen, from 30 minutes to 4 hours per day, as reported by parents. Most of 
the children (54.44%) use any type of technologies up to 2 hours per day. According to 
Lauricella, Wartella & Rideout (2015), there is scientific evidence to argue that very 
young children spend less time with media than older children. This finding corresponds

International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 with other findings (Lauricella, Wartella & Rideout, 2015), suggesting the general 
assumption that there is less  exposure to technology in educating very young children.  
 
Figure 4  
Parents’ Perceived Beneﬁts  Associated with Technology Use 
While there is evidence to suggest that the use of technology does not nearly support 
children’s social skills development, it is important to recognize that parents are aware 
of the benefits technology brings. The que stionnaire results showed that parents believe 
that by using digital technologies, children improve their language skills (46.15%), early 
learning skills (35.16%), and technology skills (40.66%). Having in mind that there are 
very few applications for youn g children in Albanian language (main language in 
Kosovo), children are using digital platforms in English language and this might be 
considered by their parents as e beneficial modality for their children language 
development. These results complement oth er studies related to the language teaching 
lessons in particular. Such studies emphasize that the use digital stories that promote 
lessons as enjoyable and productive affect the improvement of language skills, interest, 
attitudes, attention and motivation  in a positive way (Girmen & Kaya, 2018).  However 
other fields of development are considered to be rather poorly developed, such as social 
skills (10.99%), psycho - motor development (2.20%), and communication skills 
(29.67%).  
In addition, our findings of this study are consistent with other studies in the field of 
early childhood education and the use of technology. Such studies also support the 
conclusion that parents have positive attitude towards the use of digital technologies in 
early childhood educat ion (see: McCloskey, 2018; Genc, 2014; Vittrup, 2014; 
Blackwell, Lauricella & Wartella, 2014). In addition, they support the process of 
exposing their children to technology supplies arguing in favor of the technology 
benefits on their children development . As reported by Ihmeideh & Alkhawaldeh 
(2017), both parents and teachers expressed a high degree of agreement concerning the 
role of technology digital media in developing child culture.  
Nevertheless, data presented in the Figure 5 indicates parents’ conc erns about the 
negative effects of technology on their children’s development. As our findings present, 
parents’ indicate their concerns by reporting distress that their children: a) are spending 
excessive screen time (51.55%), b) can be exposed to inappro priate content when using

negatively influenced by commercial content (11.34%), e) are engaged in less time 
playing in the yard (51.55%), might develop physical disorders (36. 08%), and f) might 
develop sleeping problems (28.87%). In such cases, while studies (see: Girmen & Kaya, 
2019; McCloskey, 2018; Genc, 2014; Vittrup, 2014; Blackwell, Lauricella & Wartella, 
2014) highlight the importance of the use of digital technologies i n early children’s 
education, our study points towards other imperative aspects in early children education 
that might lack behind due to the use of technology.  
 
Figure 5  
Parent’s Concerns About Negative Effects from Digital Technology Use 
Preschool Teachers Attitudes and Practices about use of Digital Technology during 
Early Years  
Comparing to parents’ attitudes, preschool teachers declared themselves very differently 
regarding the use of digital supplies during early year’s edu cation. Most of the teachers  
believe that young children, during this age, mostly need interaction with their 
surrounding environment and engage with concrete tools (toys).  
Teacher experiences with regards to technology   
As declared by the interviewed tea chers, most of them have been raised and educated in 
an environment without the use of any type of digital technologies. None of them were 
provided with the opportunity to be exposed to an education environment that makes 
uses of digital technologies avail able at their disposal for teaching and learning. Their 
education system did not support any digital technology learning tools. The interview 
results emphasized that the previous education system power students learning through 
making use of physical mater ials as means of demonstration. Back then, the only 
technology related supplies that students were acquainted with were radio and TV. 
Therefore, teachers’ lack of experience with technology related supplies during their 
previous learning experience is a va lid predictor for their current attitudes and 
perceptions regarding the use of technology in early childhood education. The following 
verbatim quote represents this same argument.  
176                                Digital Technologies in Early Childhood: Attitudes and  … 
 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 “Our teachers never used technology in the classroom. We were educated in a  very 
traditional method. We didn’t have computers in school or at home. We even didn’t 
have TV at school. The main source of knowledge was books and teachers. During early 
childhood we didn’t used to go to kindergarten. We went to school for the first tim e 
when we were 7 years old. I saw a computer for the first time on 1999, when we bought 
one for my son” declares a preschool teacher (L.M, age 59).  
It can be seen also from other interviewed teachers that their experience with regard to 
technology was very  poor. The presented lack of experience could have affected 
teachers believes, attitudes, and practices on their present work with young children. 
Only one from eight teachers declared that she was trained to work with computer.  
Available technology suppl ies in current working place  
Most of the teachers declared that they have only one TV in the kindergarten. The TV is 
placed in a joined room where all the children from different groups could have their 
time to go there and watch a movie. During the previo us years, they were asked or 
advised from the educational inspectors not to let children watch TV at all, since they 
are being passive during that time. Based on their experience, they were using TV only 
for calming down the children as they prefer watchin g TV. This indicated experience 
shows that the only technology available in the kindergarten was no used for educational 
proposes. Five from eight kindergartens reported that they only possessed one video - 
projector that is rarely used, since the group is packed and it is logistically inconvenient 
to organize spate projector group uses. Moreover, the interviewed teachers declared that 
they lack any kind of smart devices in the classroom. In addition, children are not 
allowed to bring their own devices at sc hool/ kindergarten. In all the classrooms, they 
declared that they do have a music player. The music player is bought usually by parents. 
There are no computers in the classrooms in none of the seven public kindergartens in 
Kosovo’s main cities.

following:  
“Through imaginary play with these technology supplies, children develop their 
communication skills and creativity, as well as enjoy rol e playing” (I.G, age 41).  
A preschool teacher working in a public kindergarten (F.H. age 45) declared that:  
“We encourage children to play in groups, socialize with each - other through authentic 
play and toys, even if they want to bring their own smart de vices, we don’t allow them 
to do so because the devices are fragile and children can break them and we don’t have 
time to deal with such issues”  
Personal attitudes towards digital technology  
There is a consensus among the majority of the interviewed teach ers that using digital 
technology during early years will only harm children psycho -physical development. 
The results have shown that they ignore any possibility that the use of technology 
devices is beneficial during early childhood education. Teachers ha ve claimed that if 
kindergarten funding would enable them to purchase technology supplies, they would 
only utilize them as didactical materials, serving as means for providing illustration and 
examples. Such technology supplies will not to be used by child ren themselves.  
Most of the kindergarten teachers (seven from eight) believe that children already spend 
a lot of time using digital devices at home so while they are at school or kindergarten, 
they should only play and learn in interaction with the enviro nment, other children, and 
other adults.  
“Children learn best when they explore and discuss with their peers and adults. They 
need to move around, solve authentic problems, think critically and resolve possible 
conflicts from the real -life experiences” (Pr eschool teacher H.M. age 51).  
One of the interviewed teachers (J.M. age 30) declared that she would use smart devices 
such as smart boards or other smart tablets. She said:  
“We miss very essential materials, toys and paper. I don’t know when we will be ab le to 
have smart devices in the classroom. We could only ask from parents to bring their own 
devices at school. Children love exploring and playing with them. They can learn math, 
language or singing.”  
Professional development activities for technology sk ills 
Preschool teachers were asked about their types of professional development activities 
that have helped them acquire technology skills and to what extent did their college 
coursework prompted them to integrate technology in classroom. Teachers that ha ve 
been recently graduated with a bachelor degree in preschool education (Faculty of 
Education) declared that they had only one course dedicated to ICT in preschool 
education. The other teachers that have been studying in so called Pedagogical High 
School (training offered for kindergarten teacher before preschool education was offered 
at University level) they never had a single course that dealt with the integration of 178                                Digital Technologies in Early Childhood: Attitudes and  … 
 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 technology in teaching. Similarly, teachers coming from the faculty of general pedagogy  
were not offered any course during their pre -service teacher training. All of interviewed 
teachers declared that they attended an in -service training of basic ECDL (European 
Computer Driving License) qualification. However, they have never used such train ing 
into their practice due to lack of computers at their disposal at kindergartens where they 
work.  
“It is usually one computer at principal’s office, but none in our classrooms” (I.M. age 
30). 
None of the interviewed teachers feel they are sufficiently prepared to teach early 
childhood content using technology.  
All of them would prefer a training that would prepare them to use different technology 
supplies and also help them change their traditional mindset toward technology use 
during early years.  
“We admit that the world has changed. Children of today are children of technology era. 
They like it and maybe they can learn from it if used properly”, declares one of the 
interviewed teachers (I.M. age 30).  
The findings supported by this study conclude that younger generation teachers that 
have been qualified during recent years have been displayed a more open attitude 
towards the use of technology use and the need to incorporate technology training 
during their professional development plan. However, teacher s who have been educated 
during pre -professional age (Hargreaves, 2000) have the tendency to be more reluctant 
to new teaching methods and changing their perspectives.  
DISCUSSION  AND CONCLUSION  
The purpose of this study was to analyze  preschool teachers an d parents ’ views and 
practices regarding use of digital technologies during early childhood education. Our 
findings have indicated that there are differences between parents and teacher views and 
attitudes regarding the use of digital technologies during e arly years of children or pupil 
development. Most of the parents of children 0 to 5 declared that they provide to their 
children different types of digital technology supplies starting from their first year of 
their development. Regularly, children spend a  lot of time on TV, laptop, and other 
smart technological devices. Children spend screen time from 30 minutes up to more 
than four hours per day. Parents believe that there are some benefits emerging from the 
digital media. They believe that their children  development increases in some of their 
developmental areas including: language development, cognitive, early learning skills, 
and technology skills. Children are using digital supplies in English language and this 
might be considered by their parents as e  beneficial to their language skills development. 
This funding is consistent with other findings in the field of technology use in early 
children education (see: see: Girmen & Kaya, 2018; McCloskey, et al. 2018; Genc, 
2014; Vittrup, 2014; Blackwell, Lauric ella & Wartella, 2014), However, while our 
findings are emerge and support from numerous findings in this field, the novelty of our 
results should be emphasised. That is, while the use of technology use in early children  Gjelaj, Buza, Shatri & Zabeli       179 
International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 education is important, our study s uggests that other fields of development are 
considered weekly developed, such as social skills, psycho - motor development, and 
communication skills.  
Parents believe that the use of technology improves their children’s overall development 
and school readin ess. However, they have also reported some concerns about the 
negative impact technology might have on their children wellbeing such as: lack of 
active play time in opened environment, physical development disorders or sleeping 
problems. Correspondingly, G enc (2014) have showed that parents with negative 
opinions indicate how smartphone usage can cause physical or mental problems in the 
future: they fear that their children will be introverted, have an isolated life, or be 
affected by harmful radiation. Despite this, most of them exposed their children to at 
least one digital supply during the first year of life and the number of supplies increases 
on a yearly basis. This finding is very controversial and points toward further 
discussions in the field of tec hnology use in early children education.  
Despite parent’s views, preschool teachers have very different attitudes about use of 
digital technology supplies during early years of children development. The in -depth 
interviews showed that teacher attitudes ar e mostly affected by four factors as shown in 
the model below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6  
Visualization of Factors Influencing Teacher Attitudes toward Technology Use 
Teachers’ previous experience with regards to technology use, availability of digital 
technology supplies in current working place, own believes about technology effects to 
children learning and development, and  professional development activities with regard 
to technology skills were indicated also very important at Kelly (2014). This study 
reports that teachers’ perceptions were influenced both by the interpersonal level as well 
as the community/institutional level. In addition, our findings are consistent with Kelly 
(2014) suggesting that the capacity building of teachers is important for ef fective use of 
technology tools.  
Teaching experience seems to be correlated to their attitudes toward use of technology. 
Studies show that teachers with more teaching experience have less favourable attitudes 
toward technology and use technology less ofte n than teachers with less experience 
(Blackwell, Lauricella and Wartella, 2014). Our study also depicted a similar situation 
in Kosovo. Teachers’ with more teaching experience where strictly against the 
integration of technology in their lesson plans or ac tivities with preschool children. Inan

International Journal of Instruction, January 2020  ● Vol.13, No. 1 & Lowther (2010) showed that teachers’ perceptions of instructional benefits are an 
influential factor that affects technology integration in classrooms. The interviewed 
teachers in our research also declared their vi ews as negative toward technology. This 
affected their practice as well. The study of Badia et al. (2014) presents that ICT related 
school conditions such as ICT teaching policy and ICT infrastructure show a significant 
but more modest association with tea chers’ perceived effectiveness of digital 
technology. Similarly, put finds have reported that the lack of proper technological tools 
in kindergarten, to a certain extent, have influenced their negative perceptions regarding 
the use of technology. For many years, these poor conditions have influenced teachers’ 
lack of willing to use technology with young children.  
Their professional in service and pre -service development is also poor and their 
previous experience in school was not guided by the use of techn ology. As reported by 
UNICEF (2012), it is imperative that ECCE educators are productively integrated in 
professional development related to technological use. It is important to understand that 
the process of becoming ICT competent for ECCE educator is a long-term 
transformation, which requires continuous support and monitoring. Since its beginning, 
efficient professional development program must focus both on (a) developing ICT 
literacy of the educators, and simultaneously utilizing their emerging new lit eracy for (b) 
building new pedagogies of ICT in favor  of children’s learning and development.  
Findings of the study are debatable, since, on the one hand the majority of parents 
support and utilize the use of technology in their children development, while  preschool 
teachers (later in children education) are stemming children’s exposure to digital 
technologies. This influences children development in many levels, while in this case 
creating two confusing levels of early children education, i.e. using both p rogressive and 
regressive philosophies in children development. This is also relevant to initiate 
discussions at policy level, in the country and other countries concerning with similar 
conflicts. Findings have policy implications for preschool curriculum implementation 
towards quality education in early children development. This research contributes to 
enhancing the aspect of cooperation between educators and parents in harmony with 
Kosovo's strategies and documents for Digital Technologies in Early Child hood  
The question today on the use of technology does not concern the paradigm of whether 
it is positive or negative. Today, the use of digital technologies in education system is 
inevitable. Rather, different stakeholders involved with early childhood dev elopment 
should acknowledge both the benefits and risks that technology use brings to children 
and teachers. A continuous cooperation between parents and teachers should be 
facilitated to ensure prospects of maximizing its benefits and alleviating potentia l risks 
in early childhood education .

This brief is part of a series of publications on adolescents working in adult entertainment in Nepal. Findings on the lives 
of adolescent girls and boys working in the sector can be found in the accompanying report ; and cross-border sex work 
between India and Nepal is explored in this brief . 
Overview
While digital technology can help adolescents promote their rights, access information and participate in society, it also 
comes with risks of exploitation and abuse. There is a dearth of information on how adolescents working in the adult 
entertainment sector (AES) use the digital technology and its impact on their well-being. This brief aims to bridge the 
information gap to safeguard vulnerable adolescents working in the AES from the negative impacts of technology use and 
help them to leverage technology for their protection. 
The scale of the challenge
Understanding how vulnerable adolescents use technology and what impact it will have on them will be important in helping 
build adolescents’ capabilities. There is a dearth of data on this for Nepal and this report aims to fill that gap by discussing 
technology use amongst adolescents working in the Adult Entertainment Sector, a sector where these adolescents are 
highly vulnerable to physical, sexual, economic and emotional violence.
Key recommendations
• NGOs should make more use of social media and digital technology to raise awareness among adolescents in Nepal 
about career counselling and risky jobs such as in the adult entertainment sector.
• Digital literacy interventions for girls and boys in schools and for those working in the adult entertainment sector would 
reduce the risk of online exploitation.
• Programmes should use social media to target ‘hard to reach’ girls and boys in the AES and develop long-term, cost-
effective interventions.
• NGOs/INGOs and the government should revise their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online sex work is captured.

November 20202Methodology 
This brief is based on data from 9 life history, 40 in-depth, 
and 45 key informant interviews, as well as 28 focus group 
discussions and 3 case studies. The 211 participants included 
girls and boys engaged in the AES , people of all ages from 
their home towns, key informants and boys working in hotels 
(India only). The interviews took place in 4 Nepali districts: 
Sindhupalchowk (as the home town), Kathmandu, Jhapa and 
Sunsari (as destinations for work in the AES); in Delhi in India 
(for cross-border AES work); and at 2 points on the India-
Nepal border in Jhapa. Associated AES websites, social 
media, Phulchowki Media and YouTube videos were also 
analysed.
The study follows the Gender and Adolescence: Global 
Evidence (GAGE) conceptual framework,2 which examines 
issues through a context lens – the family, household, 
community, state and global contexts in which adolescents 
are situated (see Box 1). 
Literature review and background 
information 
Why is a focus on adolescents important for 
Nepal?
Adolescents (aged 10–19 years) make up 16% of the 
world’s population (UNICEF, 2019), and 22% of Nepal’s 28.5 
million citizens (UNFPA, 2017). There are 3,207,821 male 
and 3,199,583 female adolescents in Nepal (NPCS and  
CBS, 2012). 
Despite its young population, citizens of working age 
(15–64)3 currently outnumber dependents in Nepal due to 
falling birth and mortality rates. This demographic dividend, 
which began in 1995, has created a window of opportunity 
for growth and sustainable development that will continue 
until 2047 (Amin et al., 2017) (see Figure 1). 
Nepal has one of the fastest ageing rates in the world and 
will be classed as an ageing society4 by 2028 and as an aged

change strategies and contexts matters. Second Edition. London: Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence.

4 Where people aged 65+ account for more than 7% of the population.
5 Where people aged 65+ account for more than 14% of the population.society by 2054 (UNFPA, 2017).5 There are currently enough 
people of working age to support the older population, but 
this is expected to change over time. In 2015, there were 11.1 
people of working age for every older person – by 2050, this 
will halve to just 5.6 people (Amin et al., 2017). The working 
population will also need to support other groups, such as 
people with disabilities and vulnerable indigenous groups. 
The government wants children and adolescents to be 
far more productive than today’s adults by the time they 
enter the workforce (ibid.) and views adolescents as central 
to the country’s development agenda. A national youth policy 
(MoYS, 2015) outlines why investment in the capabilities of 
adolescents is going to be critical in the coming decades:
• adolescents alive today will need to be self-sufficient in 
retirement, as the younger population will be too small 
to support them 
• as life expectancies increase, adolescents will need to 
plan for a longer retirement Box 1: The GAGE programme 
GAGE is a nine-year (2015–2024) mixed methods 
longitudinal research programme, exploring gendered 
experiences of adolescents. It follows lives of 20,000 
adolescents in six focal countries in three regions of the 
world: Ethiopia and Rwanda in Africa; Bangladesh and 
Nepal in Asia; and Jordan and Lebanon in the Middle East. 
GAGE aims to fill the vast evidence gap on ‘what works’ 
to enable poor adolescent girls to emerge from poverty 
and fast-track social change for themselves, their families 
and communities, and their countries. GAGE’s research 
addresses two broad questions:
• What do adolescents’ lives look like as they evolve over 
the second decade of life and how are their experiences 
gendered? 
• What impact have change strategies (e.g. through 
programme interventions) had on adolescents’ 
development?3• adolescents will need to contribute more throughout 
their lives to support the ageing population – the 65+ 
age group will become the largest group in 22 years and 
will increase rapidly thereafter.
Technology use among adolescents in South 
Asia and Nepal
The literature on adolescents and digital technology is patchy 
(see Livingstone et al., 2017), but studies have explored 
internet access; agency; digital skills; patterns of use; IT for 
education and information (Ibegbulam et al., 2018; Zelezny-
Green, 2018); identity; social and romantic relationships; 
negotiations with clients among adolescent girls (Onyima 
and Egbunike, 2018); and psychosocial well-being, health and 
violence (Stonard et al., 2014; Carson et al., 2018). 
Globally, there are 3 billion internet users and 7 billion 
mobile phone subscriptions – South Asia accounts for more 
than half of the latter (CWIN and ECPAT, 2015). While there 
is no age-disaggregated data on the use of technology in 
Nepal, over 75% of internet users in South Asia in 2011 were 
students and 25% of children send over 50 messages a day 
(ibid.). Figures from Nepal’s Telecommunications Authority 
show that the number of mobile phone subscriptions (38.3 
million) was larger than the total population (28.5 million)  
in 2018.6

8 Ibid.Phone use is one area where the gap between rural/
urban, class and ethnicity in an otherwise very unequal 
society is almost non-existent (except for gender – 80% 
of men and 65% of women use mobile phones).7 In 2018, 
more than half of Nepal’s population used a smartphone – 
this is expected to rise by 10% each year (Nepali Telecom, 
2020) – 65% were online, 60% use social media and 58% 
access news through such sites.8 In January 2018, Nepal had 
nearly 9.3 million Facebook users and more than 6.4 million 
registered YouTube users (Ministry of Communication and 
Information Technology, 2018). 
In Nepal, studies have at looked adolescents and 
internet use (UNICEF, 2018; Acharya 2016), including in 
relation to education (Acharya, 2016), school-based sexual 
and reproductive health (Shaivitz, 2017), and acceptance 
of violence among adolescent girls (UNICEF, 2018). As a 
result of technology, the way today’s adolescents socialise, 
learn and interact is very different from previous generations. 
However, this rapid growth in technology and internet access 
has had both positive and negative impacts on adolescents 
and children in Nepal. It offers them a means to promote 
their rights, access information and participate in society, 
but it also brings risks of surveillance, exploitation and further 
exclusion (Livingstone et al., 2017). Other than gaming, 
adolescents are active on social media. They create public Figure 1: Forecast demographic changes in Nepal by age group

4profiles and build online relationships on social sites like 
YouTube – a site also used by traffickers to lure children 
into sex work (Gupta et al., 2017). 
Digitalisation in the AES, including for sex 
work 
The use of technology in sex work globally started in the 
1980s with online ads (Cunningham and Kendall, 2011). 
As countries cracked down on red light districts and 
street-based sex work, much of this work migrated online 
(Campbell et al., 2018; MacPhail et al., 2015; Cunningham 
and Kendall, 2011). Over time, digitalisation transformed 
the whole sex industry: outreach increased for both sex 
workers and clients, new online sex services were created, 
and the way sex work is marketed and organised changed. 
Digitalisation also changed employment arrangements, 
leading to a shift from formal employment such as that 
based in hotels and cabaret bars to more informal self-
employment (Cunningham and de Angelo, 2017; Sanders 
et al., 2016). 
Studies on the AES in Nepal largely focus on the 
involvement of minors (Dank et al., 2019; Frederick et al., 
2010; Risal et al., 2018; Shakti Samuha, 2008), international 
trafficking (Safer Migration Project (SaMi/HEL VETAS Swiss 
Inter-cooperation Nepal, 2018); protection of women; 
gender and identity issues, such as citizenship of children 
born to victims of trafficking; and trafficked women (Poudel 
and Luintel, 2003; Maiti Nepal, 2010; Richardson et al., 
2016). Apart from three studies conducted recently by the 
Freedom Fund (2018, 2019), the use of digital technology in 
the AES and its implications for programming in Nepal has 
not been explored in any depth. Most programmes fail to 
recognise the impact of digitalisation, and focus solely on 
the establishment-based AES. Understanding technology 
use is critical to ensuring policies and programmes address 
issues faced by girls and boys in this rapidly changing 
industry. 
Studies have included cases where children involved 
in the AES in Nepal have been asked to take photos 
and videos by their clients (Sath Sath, 2018; CWIN and 
ECPAT, 2015). The internet also gives children access to 
pornographic images videos. Additionally, middle-aged 
men send young girls and boys nude images on Facebook, 
indicating online sexual exploitation of children (Sath Sath, 
2018). The same study finds that men/boys create fake 
profiles and online identities to establish relationships with 
girls/women and lure them into sharing intimate pictures in 
order to blackmail them for money and sex.Research findings
How adolescent girls use digital technology 
for work in the AES 
The majority of girls reported using social media for work, 
although some prefer face-to-face contact due to fears of 
online abuse. Common apps include Facebook, Messenger, 
YouTube and imo, while the use of Viber and Instagram, 
according to key informants, is increasing among young 
girls entering the sector. 
There is a general belief that being active on social 
media attracts more clients. Girls therefore share music, 
videos, photos and public posts to increase followers, and 
while Facebook does not allow explicit content, they also 
post sexual content. 
Girls mostly own modern digital phones or smartphones 
– laptops, tablets and other devices were not commonly 
owned. Apart from company profiles on Facebook, girls 
post personal music videos, photos, TikTok videos or public 
group messages to increase followers. Aside from those 
working in Dohari, girls reported having two mobile phones 
and two Facebook accounts; one for work and the other for 
family and non-work friends. Girls working in Dohari have 
only one account and the account is in their real name, as 
they are on the lookout for contacts in the music industry 
to enhance their careers. 
Girls who engage in the cross-border AES use 
Messenger to stay in contact with clients in India when 
they are working in Nepal. Relationships with Nepali clients 
who travel for foreign employment are maintained through 
Facebook, Viber and imo. Maintaining contact ensures they 
send gifts and money, remain loyal customers and engage 
their services when they come to Kathmandu. 
While technology has not entirely dismantled 
establishment-based AES venues, it does offer alternative 
ways for girls to work and connect with clients. This applies 
to commercial sex work as well. Female migrants who 
travel for foreign employment also use apps that connect 
domestic workers to customers and integrate social sites 
like Facebook and Instagram to find clients for sex work: 
I have heard it internationally from journalists, not in Nepal 
but, there is an application called ‘SALES’ where the 
middleman provides women domestic worker or even 
CSW to clients.
Key informant interview, Kathmandu
In their free time, girls use the internet and their phones to 
keep in touch with family and friends back home, as well 
as new friends in the urban areas where they work. The 
girls watch videos on YouTube to improve their singing and 
dancing skills so that they can perform better at work. They 
also reported making prank calls to random boys for fun.5How boys, middlemen and employers use 
digital technology
Boys who work in the AES do not have to attract clients as 
their jobs in the AES are usually in cooking, security and 
administrative and financial work of the establishments. 
Even if boys work as dancers and singers (such as in Dohari9 
and dance bars), they are not pressured to bring in clients 
like the girls. (For details see our accompanying report ). 
They therefore use Facebook for personal communication. 
Middlemen and employers use social media and 
digital technology to recruit new girls and move them 
between employers and clients including for cross-border/
international adult entertainment work. The middlemen 
who supply girls communicate with them through social 
media to offer them jobs. As they earn a higher commission 
for younger girls, they are constantly incentivised to recruit 
young girls into the industry. They do this by adding village 
girls on Facebook, communicating with them regularly, and 
luring them to urban areas to work in the adult entertainment 
industry. Employers also use digital technology to live-
stream videos and post photos of celebrities, models and 
artists to attract girls and boys to work in the industry and 
clients to their establishments.
Employers use technology to move girls between cities 
in Nepal to respond to the demand for ‘fresh faces’. After 
a girl has worked in a city for a few months, the middleman 
or employer will connect her to clients, middlemen and 
employers in another city and send for a replacement. All 
these arrangements happen over the phone. The same 
process is used for moving girls to India. We also found that 
girls will invite their friends if they find the work is good in a 
new location. After a few months, they often move together 
to work in another hub. 
Internet access among girls and boys working 
in the AES
Access to the internet is mixed. Although Wi-Fi is often 
free at their place of work, boys and girls are usually only 
allowed to use the internet to contact clients. As explained 
above, boys are usually not engaged in entertaining clients 
but have security and management roles and as such their 
use of the internet is not seen as necessary for bringing 
in customers, unlike for girls. Hence, employers are strict 
about not letting boys use internet during their working 
hours. (For details see our accompanying report .) When 
not at work, girls and boys either buy a monthly data pack 
or use passwords to the Wifi given by fellow tenants. They 
cannot afford unlimited home internet subscriptions. 
9  Dohari are duet houses where groups of girls and boys sit opposite to one another and the lead sings duets. The songs are flirty and conversational 
and are composed during the performance itself as an answer to the remark of the opposite group who takes the lead in singing.Our employer will scold us if we use phones during work. 
Boys mostly go to the restroom to use internet and 
mobile. Once inside the restroom, they play games on 
the mobiles or use Facebook.

clubs, Kathmandu.
How girls in the AES communicate with 
clients 
Initial client conversations commonly take place via text 
message, while illiterate girls use Messenger and imo. Once 
the girls have met the clients a few times, they will video call 
or chat with them over Messenger. It is a common practice 
to have two SIM cards/phone numbers – one personal, 
the other for business – to avoid family members hearing 
about their work. 
Yes, I am afraid that parents will know about me. When 
my husband comes to Kathmandu I change my number. I 
have been using two SIM cards; one is for my clients and 
the other one is for my family.
In-depth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Kathmandu.
Clients forcing girls to share their phone numbers is a 
common challenge for girls. Employers also encourage 
girls not to refuse the clients. Girls only share work numbers 
with trusted clients that they have met a few times in case 
they end up harassing them or being impolite. If they do not 
trust them, but they are a good source of income (regular, 
pay well, important to the employer), girls will offer to call 
them instead of sharing their numbers. The contacts of 
trustworthy clients are saved to avoid fake and unwanted 
calls and their other non-work number that is used to 
contact family members is not shared with clients even if 
they ask for it. Yes, I am afraid that parents 
will know about me. When my 
husband comes to Kathmandu I 
change my number. I have been 
using two SIM cards; one is for my 
clients and the other one is for my 
family.
(In-depth interview with girl engaged in 
freelance sex work, Kathmandu)6I give [them my number] if the person seems nice. If the 
person and his behaviour don’t look nice, I don’t give. 
Interviewer: Can you identify by looking? Can you know 
their behaviour? How do you know? 
Some people are soft-spoken while some are very 
aggressive. The aggressive people try to force us while 
the people with good habit will obey us.
In-depth interview with a girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Jhapa. 
Girls working in the AES establishments and freelance 
primarily use Messenger to communicate with clients. As 
with mobile phones, initial contact happens via text. Once 
comfortable, the girls switch to voice and video calls. Girls 
with low literacy use Messenger voice calls. 
When communicating via social media, clients often 
request sexualised video calls (involving flirting or the 
performance of sexual acts) or ‘private’ pictures. Most girls 
were cautious about accepting calls or sharing sensitive 
content, unless it was with a regular, trusted client. However, 
those who are open to sharing such contents perceive this 
as necessary to keep clients happy for their own financial 
benefit. They also feel it is good for work and part of their 
duty to employers to accept such requests. 
He asks me to send pictures and then I send. He sends 
his picture. We then start to comment on each other’s 
picture. 
Interviewer: Do you do video call?
Yes, I do. 
Interviewer: Doesn’t he ask you to show him your private 
pictures? 
No, he has not asked for that yet.
In-depth interview with girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Jhapa.Girls entering the AES who have completed secondary 
school tend to use imo and Viber instead of Facebook. 
They believe these apps are safer, as clients cannot 
contact them unless they have their number. On Facebook, 
one does not necessarily need a phone number to call. 
However, if the clients have their numbers, they can call 
them over Viber or imo unless the girls block them. 
I use Facebook and there are numerous people calling 
me on Messenger. So, I usually prefer Viber and imo 
because strangers cannot directly contact without my 
phone number. On Facebook, the boys sometimes sent 
pictures of their private parts.
Focus group discussion with girls engaged in freelance 
sex work, Sunsari.
Use of imo groups
The study finds that imo groups are location specific 
(‘Kathmandu Girls and Boys’ and ‘Rodhi ghar Butwal (duet 
singing house, Butwal)’), interest based (‘let’s chat with 
couple’, ‘Indonesian and Philippines girls’, and ‘Dohari’), or 
random (‘Everyone’s dear and fun group’). Anyone can join 
these groups. Some are international, while others have 
only local members. 
Fake accounts were active in all the imo groups looked 
at. A review of the messages in group chats finds that 
conversations are flirty, usually have double meanings and 
include the exchange of sensitive and sexual images. Any 
user can start a private chat from a group chat. Requests 
for private chats with girls are common. It seems that clients 
make contact with girls through groups, and then move on 
to private chats to negotiate sex, meeting time/place and 
payment. 
The study finds that imo groups used by sex workers 
appear to have been created by girls (as administrators). 
However, key informants were of the opinion that men or 
boyfriends who work as middlemen often open and operate 
the groups using a girl’s name. Invitations are sent to boys 
who in turn invite their male peers, increasing the size of the 
group. Typically, an administrator will connect a group to 
several other groups to expand their networks and connect 
users to new groups.  I give [them my number] if the 
person seems nice ... Some people 
are soft-spoken while some are 
very aggressive. The aggressive 
people try to force us while the 
people with good habit will  
obey us.

(Focus group discussion with girls engaged 
in freelance sex work, Sunsari)7YouTube and online TV channels
Our analysis of YouTube channels owned by girls working 
as freelance sex workers finds that girls upload video 
interviews, photos and contact information to publicise 
their work and attract new clients. Online TV channels such 
as ‘Pulchowki Media’ also provide links to sex work. The 
channel was closed and the owners arrested in 2019 for 
paying girls for highly sexualised scripted interviews. The 
government has also closed YouTube channels which show 
restricted pornographic content. 
Positive impacts of digital technology on sex 
workers
For girls and boys working in Dohari, social media gives 
them exposure and a way to showcase their talent. They 
join professional groups like ‘National Dohari Association’ 
on Facebook to connect with people who might progress 
their careers. They believe that this opens avenues to 
participate in Dohari programmes in other cities or abroad. 
Similarly, girls feel that YouTube has helped them improve 
their dancing and singing skills (through watching new 
films), helping them perform better at work.
In Jhapa, we found freelance sex workers from relatively 
wealthy families (who were influenced to enter into sex work 
through friendship circles) used technology to exclude 
middlemen once they had established relationships with a 
few well-off clients. This gives them the freedom to choose 
clients as well as increase their earnings. First, the girls 
meet groups of clients through hotel staff or middlemen 
who work in hotels. One they have worked with a group, 
they then make personal arrangements (instead of using 
a middleman) with selected clients. This can increase their 
income considerably, as expressed by one girl:
I make around 2-3 lakhs in a month if I save.
Interviewer: In one month? You make that much money? 
In the job?
Yes.
Interviewer: Do you go around?

Box 2: Case study: NGO uses social media to reach sex workers
In Jhapa and Sunsari, NGOs are updating their engagement strategies and using technology to reach girls who may otherwise 
have been excluded from programmes. Here, NGOs are using social media to target women and girls with health and 
awareness campaigns. Sahara Nepal, a national NGO based in Jhapa that works with vulnerable groups, noticed a decrease 
in establishment-based sex work – that women and girls were soliciting in digital spaces. In response, they trained staff to 
identify and join social networks used by sex workers. Once established within the networks, they shared messages on sexual 
and reproductive health and rights, alternative livelihoods programmes, and HIV prevention and testing. They start with web 
messages, and subsequently provide information via webchat. Sex workers who previously did not want to identify themselves 
now come to drop-in centres. Based on insights from joining these networks, Sahara Nepal offered HIV testing in the community 
to enable sex workers to be discreetly tested in their own home. This resulted in a considerable increase in people accessing 
HIV tests and key informants feel that this has reduced the gap between the estimated and actual numbers of people living with 
HIV in Nepal. 8No, it’s through the contact. So the thing is at first I came 
in contact with one hotel where I used to do business 
with 15–20 people per day. I collected guest from that 
process. Before they used give 5,000 to the broker and 
4,000 to us. Now with the same guest I get 10–15,000 
or 7–8,000.
Interviewer: How do you do it yourself? Through your 
mobile?
Yes.
Interviewer: How do you make contact? Can you please 
tell me in detail?
I tell them that I am available outside the hotel. They take 
my number and call me later.
In-depth interview with a girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Jhapa.
Some girls have used a mobile phone to escape trafficking/
forced sex work by calling the police. According to key 
informants, girls also use phones to call their contacts in 
NGOS for help if the police arrest them or treat them badly.
Negative impacts of the internet and 
technology on sex workers
The study finds social media has several negative impacts, 
particularly for girls. According to key informants, it widens 
girls’ social circles, connecting them to new peer groups 
who lead them into sex work. Similarly, social media has 
made it cheaper and easier for middlemen to reach out 
and befriend girls, assess their lives, see if they are destitute 
and lure them into sex work.
Social media makes it easier for men to track girls down 
online. They find out their names in Dohari restaurants or 
dance bars when they perform on stage. Unlike other girls, 
performers in Dohari in particular use their real names on 
Facebook so that music producers can easily find them. 
They subsequently feel forced to accept unsolicited 
friendship requests from men for the sake of business 
or pushed by their employers. This opens up avenues for 
abuse by clients, including unwelcome calls, messages 
and pornographic content. Similarly, in adult entertainment 
venues, girls are under pressure to attract as many clients 
as possible. Even if they initially resist, we found they end up sharing numbers and social contacts making them 
vulnerable to future online abuse. 
Social media also gives clients continuous access to 
girls. Respondents said that clients send pornographic 
videos out of working hours. They feel pressured to 
respond, even if they are not working and spending time 
with family. Some girls were followed by clients even after 
they had left the sector to get married and eventually the 
marriages ended when the husbands and their families 
came to know about their previous engagement in the AES. 
Access to technology has changed the needs/aspirations 
of clients, as well as the range of services they expect. 
For example, clients used to only have contact with girls 
inside establishments. Now, they expect them to always 
be available, including during out-of-work hours. As girls 
are not allowed to use their phones at work, this can create 
tension with regular clients who feel ignored. They become 
hostile, send vulgar images and videos or threaten them via 
instant messaging services. 
We also found that social media increases the risk of 
exploitation from intimate partners. Boyfriends/husbands 
use social media to coerce girls into sex work and extort 
their earnings. According to the girls, their partners open 
accounts in their name and negotiate with clients, forcing 
them to provide the agreed services. This can be under 
harsh conditions, such as sex with multiple people at 
the same time. Girls often only become aware of these 
accounts much later and thus also suffer the emotional 
violence of betrayal by people close to them. 
Some girls feel freelance sex work and advertising 
online is dangerous and could risk exposure. They find 
it safer working in establishments like hotels and using 
middlemen who offer protection and negotiate with clients 
on their behalf:
I didn’t give him my number even though he was a regular 
customer. If he wants to meet me he can come here but I 
don’t want to take risk meeting him outside. If I meet him at 
the hotel the owner is responsible if something happens 
to me, but if I meet him outside who will be responsible?
In-depth interview with a girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Jhapa.
Girls who leave the sector are constantly afraid that their 
boyfriends or husbands will find out about their former work 
in the sex industry using the internet. Key informants said 
that for single mothers, the fear that their children (and the 
parents of their children’s partners) will find out about their 
sex work is a strong motivation to change jobs. Technology 
makes it possible to find out someone’s work history long 
after the event – a major fear among women who have left 
the sector. Before they used give 5,000 to 
the broker and 4,000 to us. Now 
with the same guest I get 10–
15,000 or 7–8,000.
(In-depth interview with a girl engaged 
in freelance sex work, Jhapa)9They (women who have now left the sector) say things 
like, ‘Now my daughter is married. I worked as sex worker 
so I could bring them up. What will happen to her life if her 
in-laws find that her mother was doing such work? So, I 
left the sector.’
Key informant interview, Jhapa. 
Boys who engage in substance abuse also use social media 
to exploit girls. Key informants who helped file cases against 
violent partners shared that boys who abuse substances 
entice girls into relationships via social media to extort 
money for drugs. They film sex videos with the girls and 
threaten to post them online or expose their work as sex 
workers:
A boy made a video of my friend. He hasn’t posted it on 
Facebook yet. She was telling that he has clicked her 
pictures too.
Interviewer: Why do they make videos? What type of 
people are they? Are they married people? 
The drug addict boys make that [videos]. 
Interviewer: What do they do with the videos? Do they 
blackmail girls or what do they do? Yes. They do so to get money.
In-depth interview with a girl engaged in freelance sex 
work, Jhapa.
In Kathmandu, girls working in establishments said that 
they are forced to share explicit images to attract clients 
to the establishment. Those engaged in freelance sex work 
also send images to attract and keep clients. In Jhapa 
and Sunsari, where all respondents were freelance sex 
workers, sharing pictures and doing video calls seems to be 
common. This might make girls more vulnerable to abuse 
by middlemen and clients.
Some girls who have attended NGO trainings talk about 
their right to privacy and said they refuse to send videos 
to clients. We can see, therefore, that girls have a certain 
amount of power and control in their negotiation with 
clients. However, we are not sure if in practice girls can keep 
up with the pressure from clients and their own financial 
needs. This is may be a result of awareness training and 
female empowerment interventions. 
We tell the clients in a very straightforward manner that 
it is not the place to take selfies and we would not allow 
it. After that, if they want to spend time with us they 
can or else just leave. A client was taking a video in his 
mobile. Instantly I went near him and seized his mobile 
then slapped him.

Anti-trafficking checkpoint at Nepal–India border © NISER10Conclusions and recommendations
As in other parts of the world, technology is increasingly 
being used in Nepal’s adult entertainment industry and 
is changing its structure and how the AES is organised/
mediated, particularly in relation to sex work. All girls and 
boys working in the sector have access to mobile phones 
and the internet. Facebook, Messenger and imo are the 
most commonly used apps, while younger and more 
educated workers increasingly use Viber, Instagram and 
YouTube. 
Technology has changed the nature of client interaction, 
opened up new avenues for girls who are looking to enter 
the industry and has facilitated cross-district and cross-
border sex work. It is also used outside of work to keep in 
touch with family and friends. Girls typically have two SIM 
cards and two Facebook accounts to keep their families 
from finding out about their work. 
The positive effects of technology for sex workers 
include the decreased influence of middlemen and greater 
decision-making powers (and sometimes income). Girls 
use technology to limit exposure to abusive clients and 
dangerous situations. Programmes have also started using 
technology to target freelance sex workers, who tend to be 
hard to reach.
On the negative side, it has made the recruitment of 
adolescents into sex work cheaper and easier, exposed 
adolescents working in the sector to pornography, opened 
up avenues for middlemen and sexual partners to exploit 
girls, and has made it difficult for girls to establish a family 
life once they have left the industry. 
The research also finds that technology pushes more 
adolescents into sex work, as middlemen have increased 
access to girls online. In addition, girls and boys become 
curious about joining the sector after seeing online ads and 
live videos produced by adult venues. Technology has not 
totally displaced establishment-based sex work, but it has 
expanded the scope of the adult entertainment sector and 
the volume of sex work. Recommendations for donors, civil society and NGOs 
include the following: 
• As technology use is widespread, it can be leveraged 
to raise awareness of the risks associated with 
entering the adult entertainment sector  and promote 
alternatives, such as encouraging young girls to stay in 
education or take vocational training.
• Digital literacy classes for girls and boys working in 
this sector , as well as those in school, would help raise 
awareness of the risk of exploitation online and promote 
safety precautions.
• Programmes should use social media to target 
‘hard to reach’ sex workers  who are at increased risk 
from clients, middlemen and partners (ie, those who 
do not work in establishments, are not unionised and 
are not linked to NGOs). Lessons should be taken from 
programmes already engaged in such activities. 
• NGOs/INGOs and the government should revise 
their monitoring strategies to ensure data on online 
sex work is captured.  Their interventions should also 
shift from targeting girls who work in establishments 
to account for the growing trend of girls working on a 
freelance basis using personal contacts. 
• NGOs have expressed the need for long-term 
commitment and resources for successful 
reintegration/rehabilitation of former sex workers. 
Technology could provide low-cost dissemination and 
programming solutions to maximise existing resources. 
• Current training programmes are overly focused 
on running beauty parlours and tailor shops. These 
should be broadened to cover other skills such as 
hotel management, driving, and mobile phone and TV 
repairs to provide instant jobs and encourage young 
people to find alternatives to working in the AES.11References

INTRODUCTION
Developing countries are facing the impact of mental health pro blems while confronted with
limited resources and inequities in access to mental health care (1–5). The use of Internet and
digital technologies has the potential to address these gaps, facilitating the development of more
equitablemodelsofcareinavarietyofcontexts( 6–8).
Internet and digital technologies could be a powerful strate gy for the delivery of mental health
services in low-resource settings. Although Internet-bas ed and digital interventions have shown
their potential beneﬁts in developed countries ( 8–10), there is a lack of studies in developing
countries. In particular, randomized controlled trials (RC Ts) investigating the eﬀectiveness of
Internet-basedanddigitalinterventionsindevelopingcou ntriesislacking( 11–13).Itis,therefore,

Chile is a developing Latin American country with a high
prevalence of mental disorders and marked socio-economic an d
geographical inequities in access to health care ( 14–17). Since
the 1990s, Chile has developed community-based mental healt h
services throughout the country to reduce the gap between
mental health needs and access to treatment ( 18). The public
health system, which serves approximately 70 per cent of the
population including the most at-risk groups in Chile, between
the years 2000 and 2010 increased the amount of human
resources for specialized mental health care and the number o f
mental health centers, especially in primary health care ( 18,19).
In addition, in 2006 Chile introduced a policy that guarantee s
access to and quality of care, as well as ﬁnancial protection
for prioritized diseases ( 20), including four mental pathologies
(depression in people over the age of 15, bipolar disorder,
addictions in people under 20 years of age, and ﬁrst episode
of schizophrenia). In this way, Chile provides one of the ﬁrst
examples of an evidence-based depression intervention being
scaledupinresource-constrainedsettings( 21,22).
However, after 25 years of relatively successful mental hea lth
policies, mental health in Chile still presents serious deﬁci encies
andcontinuestobeconsideredagreatchallengeforpubliche alth
(23). There is still a striking imbalance between government
spending on mental health and the related disease burden in
Chile (4). Thus, the treatment gap remains high: only 38.5% of
those with a diagnosis receive any type of mental health servi ce
(17),andtherearelongwaitinglistsforpsychologicaltreatme nts
in primary health care settings ( 23,24). This gap is unequally
distributed among social strata. Multiple socioeconomic and
territorial inequalities persist, with a high concentratio n of
specializedmentalhealthservicesinthecapitalcity( 18).
Digital technologies are highly utilized across all social strata
in Chile ( 25). This high level of digital connectivity ( 26)
has recently facilitated the development of e-mental health
interventions in an eﬀort to improve access to treatment
for diﬀerent populations across the country and to utilize
preventativemethods.
The aim of this article is to provide a description of the use
of Internet and digital technology in mental health through a

METHODS
We conducted a literature search of available source descri bing
the use of Internet and digital technologies in mental healt h
in Chile. Anticipating a small number of randomized clinical
trials, we decided to do a narrative mini-review of the liter ature.
A systematic or scoping review method was not used because
it would have required greater consideration of interventi on
eﬀectiveness. A mini-review allowed for greater discussion of
important areas in which we believe that Internet and digital
technologies could yield considerable gains toward addres sing

Study Selection and Data Collection
Process
Study selection and data collection were carried out by team s
of two reviewers in an independent manner (GR and VM, AJ-
M and PF). Study records were compiled and duplicates were
removed. The study selection process was documented using
thePRISMAExtensionforScopingReviews(PRISMA-ScR)ﬂow
diagram ( Figure1) in order to achieve a correct organization of
the procedure ( 27). If the information was insuﬃciently detailed
in the original article, we contacted the corresponding auth or
asking for the preliminary study results. Narrative technique s
were the selected approach for data analysis and synthesis, wit h

RESULTS
After the full-text eligibility assessment, we found three RC Ts
(28–30), three acceptability and/or feasibility studies [( 31,32);
Martínezetal.underreview],andthreeon-goingstudieswi thout
published results [( 33,34); Irarrázaval et al. under review]. The
responsible researcher from three studies (Gaete et al., und er

maincharacteristicsofeachstudyarepresentedin Table1.
Remote Collaborative Depression Care
Programs
Rojas et al. ( 28) tested the feasibility, acceptability, and
eﬀectiveness of a remote collaborative depression care (RCDC )
intervention for patients living in rural areas. The RCDC
methods used Web-based shared electronic health records
(SEHR) between primary care teams and a specialized mental
health team, remote supervision by psychiatrists through the
SEHR and/or telephone, and telephone monitoring of patients.
Once a week, the specialized mental health team reviewed data
entered into the SEHR by the primary care team, and provided
remote assistance by entering suggestions into the platform ,
and in special cases by giving indications over the telephone.
Their results showed that the RCDC program achieved higher
user satisfaction (odds ratio [OR] 1.94, 95% CI 1.25–3.00) an d
better treatment adherence rates (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.02–3.19 )
at 6 months compared to usual care. There were no statically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in depressive symptoms between the

Martínez et al. ( 29) tested the feasibility, acceptability, and
eﬀectiveness of a RCDC intervention for adolescents with
depression. The intervention group received periodic remote
supervision by psychiatrists located in Santiago, through SE HR
and phone patient monitoring. The SEHR functioned as a
discussion forum allowing for specialists to assist primary c are
teams during diagnostic processes and treatment during the
acute phase of disorders through personalized, conﬁdential, and
real-time interaction. Phone calls to adolescents and his/ her
primary caregiver included monitoring of diﬀerent aspects
(e.g., adherence to pharmacological treatment). Primary ca re
clinicians were satisﬁed with the RCDC intervention, valui ng
the usefulness of receiving timely specialized support. Howev er,
there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in depressive symptoms or
health-related quality of life between groups. The adolesce nts
in the RCDC intervention group were more satisﬁed withpsychological assistance than those in the enhanced usual car e
group. Satisfaction with psychological care, in both groups, wa s
related to a signiﬁcant change in depressive symptomatology a t

Prevention Programs for Children and
Adolescents
In the study of Gaete et al. ( 30), researchers from Chile and
Finland collaborated on adapting Finland’s KiVa anti-bullyi ng
program ( 35) for 4th and 5th grade students in Chile and
on evaluating its eﬀectiveness in this new context. KiVa is an
evidence-based program to prevent bullying and tackle bullying
cases. Students in the full and partial KiVa groups received

Feasibility and Acceptability Studies for
Depression Management
Carrasco ( 31) studied the acceptability of an online adventure
video game as a psychotherapeutic tool for female adolescents
in psychotherapy for mild or moderate depression. As part of
the game design process, the author conducted focus groups
with adolescent females. In the game, players follow the stor y
of a female adolescent, who gets involved in interpersonal
situations that require psycho-social reasoning. The scori ng
system provides cues about positive game behavior in the
areas of: recognition and modiﬁcation of negative cognitiv e
bias; interpersonal skills and interpersonal problem solving ; and
behavioral activation and a healthy lifestyle. Fifteen ado lescent
femalesplayedthegameassuggestedbytheirtherapists.Pati ents
could play the game as many times as they wanted. The average
playtime was 11:57min ( SD=03:42). Most patients played
once, four patients played twice. The majority of patients ( n

=11) reported positive acceptability rates. This indicates tha t
most of them valued the game and that they thought that they
could obtain mental health-related beneﬁts from playing it. The
patient’s therapists were also interviewed, and all gave posit ive
feedback on the game and felt the game was useful for various
reasons (e.g., that it was possible in post-game sessions to re late
elementsofitwithaspectsofthepatients’lives).

Study Protocols
The Rojas et al. ( 33) project aims to study the eﬀectiveness
of a technology-assisted training and supervision program to
enhance depression management in primary care clinics in
Santiago. In order to develop a comprehensive supervision
program, trained administrative staﬀ will contact patients
from a call center to support treatment adherence, and
psychiatrists will supervise the primary care team, using a
web-basedplatform.
The Mascayano et al. ( 34) project aims to develop and
evaluate an online intervention for preventing suicide and
improving mental health among adolescents. The program uses
a web-based platform and a mobile application to cultivate
a virtual community. It includes both informational and
interactive features, ranging from suicide prevention stra tegies
(e.g., a chat with a psychologist), to components designed to
increase interactions between participants and promote a sens e
of belonging and connection. During the intervention, two
psychologists will monitor the platform, identifying behavi ors
associated with suicide risk and proceeding to an establishe d
emergency protocol. A group of adolescents played a role in
the creation of the program and have access to the platform to
facilitatediscussions.
The Irarrázaval et al. (under review) project aims to
implement a telepsychiatry service to enhance the provision of
primary care mental health for children and adolescents livi ng
in substitute care facilities. Two primary care mental healt hteams,whoprovidementalhealthcaretovulnerablechildrena nd
adolescents, will receive bimonthly videoconference superv ision
from psychiatrists located at the Faculty of Medicine of the
UniversityofChileovera6-monthperiod.
DISCUSSION
This mini-review shows that Chile has presented a slow but
progressive development of e-mental health research. Nine
studies that used Internet and digital technologies to addr ess
mental health are presented: three RCTs, three acceptability
and feasibility studies and three on-going studies without
published results. The interventions included are heteroge neous
in terms of participants and contexts (e.g., adolescents, adu lts,
patients, professionals, rural, urban), aims (e.g., collabo rative
care treatment, monitoring relapse prevention) and modaliti es
(e.g., website, online games). This demonstrates the divers ity of
interventions that can be made through digital technologie s to
meet diﬀerent needs. Despite this heterogeneity, the majorit y of
the interventions reported in this study are meant to reduce t he
burden of depression, the most worrying mental healthproblem
inChile( 16).
Studies have prioritized the use of digital technologies to
assist vulnerable groups in low-resource settings, especiall y in
primary care. This is especially relevant for low-resource hea lth
services located in rural hard-to-reach areas where there i s no
specializedmentalhealthcarenearby.Remotecollaborative care
andtelepsychiatryinterventionsreviewedinthisstudysho wthat
it is feasible to use technologies for collaborative care in t his
particular context, with adequate acceptability and satisfa ction
levelsamonghealthcareteamsandpatients.
The reviewed studies are addressing not only adult
populations but also children and adolescents, who are in
a critical period where many mental health disorders arise.
Implementing Internet-based interventions to prevent or trea t
mental health problems in this age group can be a reasonable
way of dealing with the severe scarcity of mental health care
resources in developing countries, considering that this age
group is familiar with digital technologies. The reviewed s tudies
show that Internet-based interventions are feasible in chi ldren
andadolescents,withadequateacceptabilitylevels.
Despite the recent growth of this ﬁeld, the number of
conducted and on-going studies is still low when compared
to developed countries. Most studies are mainly concentrated
on the feasibility and acceptability of the interventions. T he
few eﬀectiveness studies (RCTs) show that the interventions
supported by digital technologies are feasible, but failed to
demonstrate their eﬀectiveness in reducing symptomatology.
Demonstrating signiﬁcant diﬀerences between intervention s
and control conditions is hindered by low sample sizes that
lead to low statistical power. Therefore, there is a need to
develop more eﬀectiveness studies with larger sample sizes an d
substantial follow-up periods. Likewise, studies need to dev elop
understanding on how interventions work, for whom, and why
(mechanisms of change) they work. Given that one of the main
arguments for introducing Internet-based interventions i s their
Frontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 391Rojas et al. Improving Mental Health Through Technologies
cost-saving potential, cost-eﬀectiveness evaluations are a lso of
crucialimportancetotheﬁeld( 37).
Some of the reviewed studies reported particular concern for
the social adaptation and cultural sensitivity of intervent ions,
highlighting that the involvement of participants (patients a nd
providers) in the design of interventions could be crucial fo r
theirsuccess.Forexample,intheMascayanoetal.( 34)study,the
investigators included peer-adolescents in their research team as
“expertsbyexperience”toadvisethecreationoftheinterven tion.
Similarly,Carrasco( 31)conductedfocusgroupswithadolescents
in order to get information for the design of their video game
intervention. The Martínez et al. (under review) study also
concluded that it is necessary to involve the target users in the
designoftheinterventioninordertoencourageparticipatio n.
The studies reviewed consistently show a gap between
acceptability and usability/adherence of interventions. I n this
regard, future studies need to address challenges associat ed with
high attrition in these programs. In the CTA program, in order
to improve user retention, the authors suggested adding more
personalizedandinteractivecontent,andmoreconcretetas ksfor
users to perform during their interaction with it. Furthermo re,
in the evaluation of this program, Parada et al. ( 38) suggested
using a persuasive systems design approach. Likewise, in the
study of Espinosa et al. ( 32) participants who had completed the
intervention suggested diversifying the monitoring asses sments
and having the possibility to interact with a therapist from th e
treatment center where they underwent face-to-face treatm ent.
Both Martínez et al. (under review) and Espinosa et al. ( 32)
suggested enabling peer communication. ASCENSO and CTA
studies showed that email does not seem to be a good way
to contact and monitor participants ( 27,29). A possible way
to improve the usability and eﬀectiveness of e-mental health
interventions is to facilitate access to the content of progr ams
usingmobiledeviceslikesmartphones( 8,9).
The case of ASCENSO and CTA reveals that it is probably
relevantforparticipantstoknowthatonlinepersonalizedcon tact

withoutdisproportionatelyincreasingcostsforhealthserv ices.
A critical issue in mental health research is the gap between
what is known about interventions and what is provided
in daily care routines. To ensure the scaling-up of the
interventionsreviewed,itisnecessarytoproducemethodol ogical
developments in eﬀectiveness and cost-eﬀectiveness studies, but
also in implementation methods ( 40). Since a key strategy
for increasing the use of digital technologies in mental hea lth
programs includes the development of translation-focused
research, studies need to place greater emphasis on facilitato rs
and (structural and cultural) barriers to the implementatio n of
these technologies in the Chilean health system, especially in
primarycareservices.Most developing countries do not have suﬃcient mental
healthresourcesorhighlytrainedprofessionalsinmentalh ealth.
The accelerated growth in mobile and Internet connectivity
witnessed in the recent years have boosted the development
of the e-mental health ﬁeld in order to reduce this gap. The
lessons learned in the Chilean context can provide local
evidence for persuading policymakers and other stakeholders
to support Internet-based interventions, which is critical t o

to widely disseminate and scale up these interventions.
The Chilean case can also inspire initiatives in other
developingcountries.
CONCLUSIONS
Internet-basedinterventionsareatanearlystageofdevel opment
in Chile. There are few studies on eﬀectiveness and no studies
on cost-eﬀectiveness, which makes it diﬃcult to disseminate
and scale up these interventions. However, the growing amou nt
of knowledge accumulated in the Chilean context could guide

WeProtect Global Alliance brings together experts from government, the private sector 
and civil society to develop policies and solutions to protect children from sexual 
exploitation and abuse online. 
The Alliance generates political commitment and practical approaches to make the digital 
world safe and positive for children, preventing sexual abuse and long-term harm.
ECPAT International is a global network of civil society organisations working towards the 
vision of ending the sexual exploitation of children. With over 30 years of experience in 
engaging with and managing multi-stakeholder processes and alliances across national, 
regional and global levels; ECPAT is considered to be at the helm of all issues and 
manifestations pertaining to the sexual exploitation of children. With a Secretariat based 
in Bangkok (Thailand), driving strategic direction, producing key research and working on 
global advocacy; together with the on-the-ground efforts of 122 members in 104 countries, 
the network approach bridges local communities, governments and the private sector; 
offering a global approach combined with customised national actions. 
In recent years, important achievements have been made in the areas of prevention, 
legislative protection, child participation, research as well as collaboration with private 
companies in the travel and tourism sector in the fight against the sexual exploitation of 
children in such context, both at the national level and in the main tourist destinations of 
the country.
Fundación Renacer  is a non-governmental organisation active since 1988 in Colombia to 
prevent and eradicate the commercial sexual exploitation of girls, boys and adolescents 
in any form. The work of Fundación Renacer follows three lines of action: comprehensive 
care for victims of trafficking and sexual exploitation, prevention and research. This social 
organisation is a pioneer in the country, due to the development of comprehensive care 
and protection models and also protection environments, from a rights, gender and 
differential approach and from multisectoral and inter-institutional actions. Fundación 
Renacer has managed to develop advocacy actions to strengthen public policies to 
address these issues and has consolidated strategies in an articulated manner with the 
government sector, private sector, community, civil society and adolescents and young 
leaders in various departments, cities and municipalities of Colombia.FUNDACIÓN

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaDefining child sexual exploitation and abuse online
Child sexual abuse refers to various sexual activities 
perpetrated against children (persons under 18), regardless 
of whether the children are aware that what is happening to 
them is neither normal nor acceptable. It can be committed 
by adults or peers and usually involves an individual or group 
taking advantage of an imbalance of power. It can be committed 
with or without explicit force, with offenders frequently using 
authority, power, manipulation, or deception.¹
Child sexual exploitation involves the same abusive actions. 
However, an additional element must also be present - 
exchange of something (e.g., money, shelter, material goods, 
immaterial things like protection or a relationship), or even 
the mere promise of such.²
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online includes an evolving range of practices including: 
Child sexual abuse material: The production, distribution, dissemination, importing, 
exporting, offering, selling, possession of, or knowingly obtaining access to child sexual 
abuse material online (even if the sexual abuse that is depicted in the material was carried 
out offline). 
Grooming children online for sexual purposes: Identifying and/or preparing children via 
online technology with a view to exploiting them sexually (whether the acts that follow are 
then carried out online or offline or even not carried out at all). 
Live streaming of child sexual abuse: Sexual exploitation which involves the coercion, 
threat or deception of a child into sexual activities that are transmitted (‘streamed’) live via 
the Internet for viewing by others remotely. 
Other practices: Related concepts can include online sexual extortion, the non-consensual 
sharing of self-generated sexual content involving children, unwanted exposure to 
sexualised content, among others.³Child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online refers to 
situations involving digital, 
Internet and communication 
technologies at some point 
during the continuum of 
abuse or exploitation. It can 
occur fully online or through 
a mix of online and in-
person interactions between 
offenders and children.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaBackground
Research about child sexual exploitation and abuse online 
has received increased attention recently – particularly as our 
lives shifted further online during responses to the Covid-19 
pandemic. Research from global north countries is over-
represented on this topic, with far fewer studies taking place 
in low- and middle-income countries. A continuum exists 
for our online and offline lives which also impacts this issue 
- with blurred boundaries between our physical and digital 
worlds. Sexual violence is also taking place in different ways: 
online, as well as in situations involving online and in-person 
elements of grooming, facilitation and sharing. 
Furthermore, children’s voices about their experiences of 
these crimes continue to be rarely centralised in the dialogue 
- there is surprisingly little research directly conveying their experiences of child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online nor the responses they receive. Much of the existing research has also focused on 
identifying potential risks to children rather than directly measuring the evidence of harm that some 
have faced. This is understandable, as its ethically more complex to conduct research with young 
people who have experienced harm. Yet fully understanding online harms is important to inform 
preventions and responses. It must also be remembered that in reality, the vast majority of cases of 
child sexual exploitation and abuse go unreported, making it difficult to truly determine the scope of 
this problem in the first place. 
Researchers have used qualitative methods like online surveys to examine childhood experiences 
of sexual exploitation and abuse online – predominantly focused on survivors of child sexual abuse 
material production. In one such study, approximately half of those who responded felt that the images 
were associated with specific problems that were different to those caused by the actual abuse. Nearly 
half of the respondents worried that people would think that they were willing participants or that people 
would recognise them. Interestingly, in this study, one-third refused to talk about the images and 22% 
denied that there were images. Three themes were identified from the data: guilt and shame, their 
ongoing vulnerability and an empowerment dimension the images sometimes brought. An additional 
study of adult survivors came from the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, who conducted an online 
survey with 150 female respondents whose child sexual abuse was recorded and/or distributed online.  
Seventy per cent of that sample also expressed anxieties about being recognised from the images. 
A further qualitative study of 20 children who were referred following suspected online sexual abuse 
found that only 12 were willing to talk about what had happened. The remainder denied that anything 
had taken place in spite of the fact that there were digital images of their abuse. The interviews with 
these 12 children indicated that they were very critical of themselves, and often had strong feelings of 
loyalty towards their offender.  
The reluctance to accept, disclose, and attributions of self-blame have been evidenced in other 
research with children who have experienced online sexual exploitation, both in relation to abuse 
through sexual image production as well as online grooming. These are important lessons not only for Children’s voices about 
their experiences of sexual 
crimes continue to be rarely 
centralised in the dialogue 
- there is surprisingly little 
research directly conveying 
their experiences of child 
sexual exploitation and 
abuse online nor the 
responses they receive.8
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in Colombiaresearch studies with these hard-to-reach populations, but also in relation to the recovery needs of 
these individuals. Breaking down these common phenomena - which may be heavily internalised - is 
clearly required.
These studies notwithstanding, qualitative research with children who have experienced sexual 
exploitation and abuse online is still relatively rare. Such children are difficult to both identify and 
recruit, which in part may reflect the ethical challenges of approaching children directly, and also 
because many professionals act as gatekeepers to children and are reluctant to approach them for 
research due to justifiable fears of further traumatisation. Crucially, any such research must also be 
completed using ethically appropriate and safe techniques for engaging survivors. 
However, growing numbers of children are being supported by support services around the world for 
issues related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Seeking to understand and build on the 
strengths of such services and address their weaknesses is a priority. Amplifying the voices of young 
people who have had these experiences is vital for this work. 
The increasing problem of child sexual exploitation and abuse online requires detailed, extensive and 
sustained attention. This is especially the case in middle- and low-income countries, where the issue 
often lacks visibility and few studies have been conducted to date. 
Specific evidence about the quality and effectiveness of support services will enable targeted 
responses in which governments, non-governmental organisations and the private sector can 
cooperate to address this problem. 
Ensuring that the voices of children who have had experiences of child sexual exploitation and abuse 
online are part of the evidence – as was achieved in this project - enables child-centred and informed 
approaches that better prevent this issue from occurring, and better support those young people 
subjected to these crimes.9
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe project in Colombia
To explore child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia, this project undertook two research 
activities: 
The conversations with young survivors focused on their recommendations for improving prevention 
and support services for children (not their abuse, as explained below). The approach ensured that the 
research was informed directly by survivors who were drawing on their own experiences of harm from 
child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Including their perspectives in the research bridges the 
conspicuous gaps noted above that sometimes persist in the evidence in this sensitive area.
Surveying frontline support workers aimed to provide a substantial and nuanced understanding of 
how child sexual exploitation and abuse online is presenting in social support services. Data from 
these professionals indicates knowledge and perceptions of the problem amongst workers, caregivers 
and the general public; identifies key vulnerabilities for children; and assesses accessibility of care to 
support children subjected to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. 
Data from Colombia was presented – alongside data from five other countries involved in the project4 
to a panel of experts at an online roundtable held on 26th July 2021. Insights from the roundtable 
helped frame the data in the overall project report and this and other countries’ national reports.Qualitative one-on-one

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaConversations with survivors
The conversations with young survivors of child sexual exploitation and abuse online are of foremost 
importance to this project. They were conducted with the intention to shed light on the conspicuous 
gaps that persist when survivors’ perspectives are excluded from work to shape policy and legislation 
in this area. The conversations explored the survivors’ perceptions of the quality and effectiveness of 
existing support services, and gathered recommendations for improvements.
Rationale
Engaging survivors of child sexual exploitation in research requires substantial care to accommodate 
a range of ethical considerations.⁵ Such research must place significant value on survivors having the 
right to safely, actively and meaningfully participate in discourse on issues that impact upon them. 
Therefore, the design for the survivors’ conversations in this project was built on the principle that the 
participants had, and perceived themselves to have, significant control over the process, including 
the decisions of what they shared. A range of measures were taken that reinforced that survivors had 
full control over sharing their perspectives on their terms. 
To ensure that the perspectives of young survivors were meaningfully included in this project, ECPAT 
International developed a comprehensive, participant-centred, ethically sound, and trauma-informed 
approach to engaging them with the help of an expert who had extensive experience working with 
survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation. The ‘conversations’ approach is thus a dialogue with young 
survivors on issues which matter to them, and which explore their experiences of the support that 
they received.  
Participants were invited to speak freely about their personal experiences of support services through 
their recovery process and the facilitators used active listening to engage with the young persons and 
understand their story – exploring particular gaps in understanding and drawing out the detail needed 
to represent young people’s perspectives of these issues. Probing questions eliciting narratives across 
their experiences were only done responsively and to prompt discussion. This was not a structured 
interview with set questions – which can feel like an interrogation. Participants were invited to tell only 
the parts of their story that they wanted to. 
The conversations in Colombia were facilitated by two psychologists, a male and a female, all with 
experience in therapeutic care for child and adolescents survivors of sexual exploitation.
Sample
In Colombia, the facilitators carefully identified possible young people that could be invited to 
participate. Inclusion criteria included, inter alia, being aged between 18 to 24 years old, having had 
an experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse before turning 18 years of age as well as a need 
for participants to have current access to support structures, and for adequate time to have passed 
since the exploitation occurred.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaOf those identified and reached out to by the facilitators and their networks, nine survivors of child 
sexual exploitation and abuse online, 4 young women and 5 young men between the age of 18 to 23 
years old, agreed to take part in the conversations. The participants were identified through the work 
carried out by Fundación Renacer in association with the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare.
Conversations approach
The conversations were carefully planned to be conducted in an interactive and unstructured style, 
rather than a traditional form of research interview. The advantages of this design are that it is attentive 
to the nature and sensitivities of the topic, and promotes choice and empowerment, placing high 
value on the fact that participants have, and perceive themselves to have, significant control over 
what they share with the researchers.
Participants were also asked if they preferred to take part in conversations one-on-one or in small 
groups (for example in case they already knew some of the other participants because of participation 
in the same support groups). The nine young people decided to conduct one-on-one conversations.  
Following initial agreement to take part, conversations were then held in two stages – a ‘pre-meeting’ 
was carried out and then the ‘main conversation’ a few days later. This two-stage process was 
deliberate, symbolically indicating a trusting relationship controlled by the participant from the outset. 
The pre-meeting involved explaining the process, answering queries about consent, and seeking any 
preferences that the facilitators could accommodate in setting up the ‘main conversation’ (e.g. time 
of day, room and seating preferences, who was present etc.). Arrangements remained flexible and up 
to the local facilitators and the young people to determine together, also in light of the fast-changing 
contextual circumstances caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Facilitators took every measure to make sure that the survivors felt as comfortable as possible 
during the course of conversations. The conversational nature, open questions, allowing enough 
time to respond, regularly giving permission not to respond, all helped shape the outcomes of 
the conversations. As per the conversations’ approach, the young people were able to contribute 
verbally, but also encouraged to use a range of visual tools to facilitate the conversations (‘Past, Now, 
Future’ flip charts, speech/thought bubbles, emoji, drawings, etc.). The possibility of carrying out 
the conversations in three moments – past, present and future ¬– seemed to be appreciated by the 
participants as it represented an opportunity to verbalise their empowerment processes. The visual 
representation method, however, was not applied in all cases, as some of the participants were more 
comfortable with verbally expressing their thoughts. Their choices were fully accepted and respected. 
While the Covid-19 pandemic meant lots of interactions had to be virtual, the researchers were 
adamant that psychological safety would be hard to maintain in such an approach. Conversations 
were therefore all held face-to-face.⁶ Although the research did not seek to determine the specifics 
of the exploitation and/or abuse that the young women were subjected to, in this way the facilitators 
– trained and experienced in working with trauma – were physically present to provide psychological 
support if distress was encountered.
6. Some flexibility was needed to adapt to changing movement requirements and Covid-19 safety plans were applied.13

Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis
Following the conversations, the facilitators reflected on what they had heard, their notes, and 
recordings of the sessions. They developed a brief preliminary report – in Spanish – that focused on 
specific themes across the seven conversations, such as barriers to disclosing, the quality, usefulness 
and accessibility of services, and summarised the young women’s recommendations for improvements. 
This preliminary report was then reviewed and discussed between the facilitators, the project expert, 
and the ECPAT research team. Once finalised, it was made available to those participants who had 
indicated they wanted to see the output to offer their feedback and additional inputs.
Ethical considerations
Before beginning the research activity, ECPAT International convened a panel of three global experts 
for an independent third-party review of the proposed methodology. A detailed research protocol that 
included mitigations for ethical risks was developed, along with draft tools. Detailed feedback from 
the panel was accommodated in two rounds of review before the project commenced. 
As detailed above, the local facilitators participated in extensive preparations together with the project 
expert prior to conducting the conversations. Moreover, the process for obtaining informed consent 
was conducted in two steps – so the young people had time to consider their involvement (not signing 
consent just prior to commencing) and could control some of the circumstances of the conversations.
Frontline support workers’ survey
The engagement of frontline support workers through completion of a workforce survey was aimed 
at adding data to ‘flesh out’ a comprehensive picture of child sexual exploitation and abuse online by 
exploring the perceptions, knowledge and practices influencing disclosure and support provision.
Rationale
Workforce surveys have increasingly been used in research to gain an understanding of the 
effectiveness of social support systems. Most commonly these surveys are used by health7 and social 
work professions8 to measure service delivery effectiveness.
Social support to children who are subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse is generally provided 
within the broader context of child protection. We therefore developed and delivered a survey for child 
protection workers. The survey explored perceptions related to the sexual exploitation of children 
– in general and online; factors related to children’s access to support services; perceptions of the 
quality and effectiveness of such services; as well as details about the nature of their direct work with 
children.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaSample
Fundación Renacer utilised their national contacts to identify organisations supporting children from 
which to invite staff working at the frontline of providing support. 
While the research focus was child sexual exploitation and abuse online, very few services focus 
exclusively on support for child sexual exploitation and abuse with an online component, or even 
exclusively on general child sexual exploitation and abuse. The sample therefore included a range of 
frontline support workers who had supported at least some children subjected to sexual exploitation 
and abuse over the last year.  
A convenience sample of 89 Colombian frontline workers was surveyed. The sample should not be 
considered representative of the diversity of frontline workers in the country, however, attempts to 
represent different types of services, both in terms of geographic location as well as type of services 
were made.
In order to be eligible to complete the survey, frontline workers needed to be: 
• Over 18 years of age; 
• At least last 12 months working in the field of social work, psychology or other social support; 
• At least last 12 months managing own case load directly; 
• Case load over last 12 months included at least some children; 
• Case load over last 12 months included at least some cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of 
children.
The survey
Self-administered online surveys (emailing a link) have notoriously low participation rates. Thus, 
the design for this project opted for in-person administration ¬– though using an online tool with 
limits and designated required items for a clean dataset. While restrictions related to the Covid-19 
pandemic meant the Colombian administrators, staff members from Fundacion Renacer, had to 
support participants remotely via an introductory Zoom or phone call and then remained on standby 
to support, offer guidance and troubleshoot as the participants completed the survey. The personal 
connection helped motivate participants to complete the survey. Data collection took place between 
April-June 2021. 
The online survey consisted of 108 multiple choices and short open-answer questions. The draft 
tool in English language was translated to Spanish and ECPAT International and Fundacion Renacer 
collaborated to check and contextualise the survey, which was then pilot-tested with a small number 
of frontline workers in the country before being fielded. 
The full survey in English and Spanish can be provided on request.15
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaAnalysis
Following data collection, data was cleaned, and open-ended responses were translated to English. 
Survey output was integrated into a custom analytical framework where analysis was then conducted 
based upon exigent themes and patterns that arose from the data. Qualitative analytical components 
were then added. 
Quantitative and qualitative themes and patterns were explored, with direct (translated) quotes from 
the open text responses used to illustrate dominant narratives emerging from the quantitative data, 
along with occasional dissenting views. Care was taken during analysis not to present any qualitative 
responses that may have identified participants.  
It should be noted that the data are not statistically representative of the experiences of all frontline 
support workers in Colombia. However, the estimates, perceptions and experiences reported here 
offer valuable insight into the access and quality of social support for Colombian children who have 
experienced sexual exploitation and abuse.
Ethical considerations
Informed consent was obtained as an integrated part of the online survey tool. To protect confidentiality, 
names were not requested at any stage of completing the survey. Care is also taken when presenting 
qualitative data in this report so that participants are not identifiable by the content of the quotes.16
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaChallenges and limitations 
The Covid-19 pandemic meant movement restrictions varied at different times during the data 
collection period which had an impact both on the survivors’ conversations as well as the frontline 
workers’ survey. The facilitators overcame this challenge for the conversations with survivors by 
conducting the pre-meeting on the phone two weeks before the main conversation.
Survivor conversations were audio-recorded, but transcriptions were not completed – with the 
intention that as facilitators themselves were producing the preliminary reports, key insights would 
be easily surmised. However, in hindsight, and as the young people’s direct words were a focus, 
transcriptions would have helped to facilitate direct quotes being incorporated more easily.
The team in Colombia also noted that while the approach to conversations was carefully created to 
centre the participants, this was challenging for the facilitators to negotiate. The team suggested that 
key lines of enquiry are maybe considered as a basis for future use of the approach.
Regarding the frontline workers’ survey, a limitation occurred as a result of our inclusion criteria. Our 
intent was to include support workers who worked directly at the frontline (not higher up managers). 
Thus, a hurdle question sought experience of working directly with children “within the last 12 
months. ” As data collection occurred in the first half of 2021, the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic had 
restricted some frontline workers from doing direct client work for some time, so it is likely that some 
of the 40 participants who began the survey but were disqualified by hurdle questions may have been 
false positives. Weak Internet connections in areas such as La Guajira and the Amazon resulted into 
difficulties in administering and completing the survey. Connection issues also extended dramatically 
the time to complete the survey for some respondents, rather than 30 minutes, some reported it had 
taken them as much as 90 minutes or more to complete. 
For some government respondents working from the office at the time, an additional challenge was 
gaining access to the survey online platform as their work computers blocked access to the website.  
Finally, during the data collection period, widespread national protests were occurring and some 
potential respondents lost their employment. Rescheduling appointments was necessary throughout 
this time to meet the sample requirements. Photo by Yaopey Yong
FINDINGS18
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe perspectives of the young people who had direct experiences of harm from child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online are the primary data used to structure this report. Quantitative and qualitative 
data from the surveyed frontline support workers is then integrated amongst their perspectives to 
enhance a comprehensive picture of the on-the-ground situation for preventing and responding to 
child sexual exploitation and abuse online in Colombia. Public perceptions and beliefs, the knowledge 
and practices of workers, availability and quality of reporting mechanisms and the resource levels of 
support services are all presented. The report concludes with recommendations for action – these 
stem primarily from what the young people told us but are expanded in places with other data and 
analysis from the project partners.
Trends in child sexual exploitation and abuse online  
in Colombia
Gender
The survey data suggest that there is a higher proportion of girls than boys utilising formal reporting 
mechanisms and accessing support services in Colombia. In an open question, participants were 
asked if they thought there were trends related to gender and sexual exploitation (generally and 
online). Figure 1 shows that almost a half (48%) indicated that they perceived more girls than boys 
were affected:

9. Please note that text in green boxes refers to quotes from the young survivors who took part in the conversations. Text in purple boxes 
refers to the qualitative input shared by frontline workers who completed the survey.A number of respondents assumed that the low access of support services by boys would probably be 
because girls are overwhelmingly seen as more at risk in the country – for a full range of concerns, but 
also for sexual exploitation. One of them commented that:19
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaHowever, it seems that despite the perception that girls are more at risk, boys too are clearly seeking 
assistance for a range of things, including for child sexual exploitation and abuse online. Indeed, 
survey data also show that most of the frontline workers had provided some support for boys. Eighty-
three percent of the respondents (n=74) said that they had boys among their caseloads and of these, 
62 workers (84%) said that they had supported boys for sexual exploitation and abuse online. This 
was actually quite similar to the participants who had provide support to girls (87%, n=77) and most 
(n=70) had supported girls related to online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. In line with global 
research,10 these numbers confirm that while perspectives might be boys are less impacted, caseloads 
suggest more boys than is commonly thought are impacted. 
On top of that, there were some interesting departures from expectations in the Colombia data. A 
number of respondents said that “[…] non-binary people are identified” within the support services. 
They also mentioned that 
These data confirm other research indicating that young people with diverse sexual and gender 
identities are vulnerable to sexual exploitation.11 In some cases, their diverse status may contribute 
to risks. Indeed, in the conversations, one young man who identifies himself as gay said that the 
feeling of loneliness led him into risky situations. He was manipulated by older men and got involved 
in relationships that he could not identify as abusive due to the need to reaffirm his sexual identity. 
Age
The 62 frontline workers who had worked with boys for online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse, 
reported that nearly half (47%) were targeted between the ages of 11-15 years old. The five young men 
who took part in the conversations were at a similar age to this majority when they were abused (all 
were between 13 and 17).“[…] there are confusions on sexual orientation in many of the children and 
adolescents served” and that “it is harder for the LGTBTQIA+ population to recognise 
their vulnerability [to sexual exploitation and abuse]. ”

However, the data showed that a greater proportion of the impacted boys were younger. Eighteen 
percent of the reported cases involving girls involved children under the age of eleven years old, 
compared with 27% of the cases involving boys. As one worker said, while violence against girls is 
mostly based on gender, age is what makes boys more vulnerable to sexual exploitation and abuse. 
“Yes, there are more women and girls victimised with sexual exploitation; by saying 
this, I don’t mean to say that there are no cases with boys or men; however, these are 
evidenced in relation to age, that is, there are more boys compared to adult men. ” 
Reporting mechanisms
Awareness
Conversations with the young survivors generally illustrated little awareness of the formal reporting 
mechanisms that are available. During the conversations, all the young people said that they had not 
received information about where to look for help when they were subjected to sexual exploitation and 
abuse. 
“There is no information on how to report. The girls and boys don’t report, it scares 
them, because of the process they are going to face […] One must have support 
in order to report, someone to accompany the survivor. Family support and 
psychological help are needed. ” 
(VoS-COL-06)
They also demonstrated fear of facing the bureaucratic processes often involved in formal reporting 
mechanisms. Five of the nine young people spoken to had disclosed sexual exploitation to school 
or community members who, at the time, were in charge of promoting awareness campaigns about 
this form of violence. The young people said that, once they reached out, these adults not only 
demonstrated empathy but also acted to end ongoing situations of exploitation and abuse. Non-
judgemental attitudes, careful and genuine listening, persistence, patience and friendly treatment 21
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe family and community members acted as mediators between the children and the formal reporting 
mechanisms, so they could gain access to the support they needed.
Unfortunately, a sense that these issues were well understood was not the rule within the young 
people’s communities. In fact, in the conversations the young people pointed out the needs to raise 
awareness and promote knowledge on how to disclose.
The lack of general public awareness was reiterated by the frontline workers who participated in 
the survey. When asked about the level of public awareness regarding online forms of child sexual 
exploitation and abuse in Colombia, the majority (74%, n=66) considered it “poor” . A smaller fraction 
of the respondents answered that it was either “fair” (17%, n=15) or “good” (8%, n=7), while only 
one person (1%) considered it “excellent” . Although this question was not specifically related to the 
awareness of reporting mechanisms, the fact that most of the frontline workers who responded to 
the survey believed that there is little awareness of child sexual exploitation and abuse online in the 
first place confirms what survivors explained – that there is likely to be very little knowledge on how 
to report if it occurs.
An interesting finding was that respondents with more years of work experience were particularly 
negative about public awareness, as shown in Figure 5 below. This could be an indication that their 
perceptions about how informed is the society changes over time, as they gain more experience in the 
field.were some of the characteristics mentioned by the young people when describing those who received 
their disclosures. One young woman said that her family members told her:
“’Always count on us, here we will be a family waiting for you so that you can recover. ” 
(VoS-COL-09)
“Because I can tell you, if a case happens in the neighbourhood, they choose violence, 
because they don’t know what else to do. If they call the police, the police in some 
cases do almost nothing, people make violence justice by their own hands. ”

A number of surveyed frontline workers proposed that more education and training is needed in order 
to increase public awareness in Colombia: 
In fact, this was a recurrent topic on survey qualitative responses as well as in the conversations. Both 
sources of data strongly suggest the need for knowledge and skills development amongst frontline 
support workers on how to identify and work with online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse: 
Another frontline worker said that:“From the training academy of the universities, there should be a chair covering 
awareness in this dimension of protection towards children and adolescents. ” 
“The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of 
cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence. Having the 
support of reporting portals creates awareness among the police and state agencies 
to address these problems. ” 
“It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence; it is 
important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of 
sexual violence in a joint manner; this includes the family, the state and the society. ”23
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations the young people consistently mentioned the need to promote information 
and prevention on topics related to the use of digital environments. A number of them believe that 
information about it is not disseminated widely and, as a consequence, it does not reach those who 
are most at risk of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.
Some young people specifically raised the need to inform parents and adult family members so they 
become able to educate their children about the risks involved in the use of the Internet. According to 
one young person, the usage of mobile phones and particularly of social media should be monitored 
by caregivers, who are the utmost responsible for children’s safety online.
One young person said that promoting information about this type of violence is useful not only to 
alert people of the risks, but also to increase the reports: “Knowing about cybercrimes - that would have made me stop a bit and I would have 
realized that what was happening to me was that I was being the victim of a crime. For 
us as young people it is important to recognise the strategies that these people use to 
manipulate and deceive and thus achieve to identify and stop them. Not knowing how 
they act gives them an advantage to be able to deceive us. ” 
(VoS-COL-05)
“Parents give their children access to a cell phone to entertain themselves and they 
use it for other things; it’s a way for exploiters to get closer. Parents need to pay more 
attention and have more communication with their children. They need to teach them 
the risks of communicating with strangers; When creating an account on Facebook, 
how to use it and how to be careful (protect themselves) with social networks. ”  
(VoS-COL-06)
“The mayor’s office and the government institutions and social organisations must 
create digital programmes or permanent institutional radio or television spaces 
where they warn about the risks. More information [means] more cases reported. 
Community leaders need to be trained to help protecting children. They can identify 
victims, facilitate victims’ access to institutions. ”   
(VoS-COL-03)24
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaBarriers to disclosure
Seeking help may be a challenge due to the stigma and judgments surrounding reporting mechanisms 
and support services. Unfortunately, this stigma can come from those who were supposed to protect 
and support children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse. Fear of being recognised, judged and 
stigmatised were main barriers to disclosure that came up in the conversations with young people. 
They described situations where they were blamed by frontline support workers while reporting:
Fear of re-victimisation and distrust of formal reporting mechanisms were also mentioned by the 
young people as barriers to disclosure. They mentioned situations in which they were forced to repeat 
their statements due to the high turnover of frontline workers, and consistently referred to fears of 
their abuse and/or exploitation being reduced to a ‘scandal’ as one of the reasons that led them to 
think: 
The barriers to disclosure were also explored in the survey with frontline workers, as indicated in 
Figure 6. The respondents were presented with a list of 18 factors that could potentially limit children’s 
disclosure of online sexual exploitation and abuse. By far, the two most commonly selected barriers 
to reporting were related to a pervasive culture of silence (“the stigma and shame that victims often 
experience”) at 58% (n=52), and to “fears about how others will respond to disclosure” , (54%, n=48). 
These accounts confirm the fears of anticipated shame and stigma associated with sexual exploitation 
and abuse. The attitudes and responses of those people charged with receiving these disclosures 
may have enormous impacts on children.“A cousin sought help for me and I went to the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare. A 
psychologist who was there offended me and told me that I was the only one to blame 
for what had happened to me. I started crying, I felt hatred for her. How is it possible 
that you go to seek help and she tells you: ‘it’s your fault?’ , That’s unethical. ”  
(VoS-COL-04)
“The fear of the report has to do with the fear of scandal. The relevant agencies 
(Colombian Institute of Family Welfare, Police, Courts) need to have more bonding 
with the victims, more support; victims don’t easily access services; they aren’t well 
cared for. Officials don’t have empathy, they don’t understand the consequences of 
violence, they re-victimise them. They lack training. There is no psychological support 
for girls and boys to come and report. ”  
(VoS-COL-10)“it’s better if I don’t report. ”

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaIn the conversations, the young people also mentioned that they feared being threatened and 
blackmailed by the offenders. One young woman said that over time, children subjected to online 
forms of sexual exploitation and abuse 
As shown in Figure 7, coincidentally, psychological support was one of the most common services 
provided by the frontline workers. When asked about the different types of direct support services 
provided by their organisations to children who have experienced sexual exploitation, two-thirds 
(66%, n=59) reported offering one-on-one counselling. The other most common service provided was 
support for families and caregivers (65%, n=58). Describing the type of service provided, one surveyed 
frontline worker said: She said that although she recognised the situation of sexual exploitation and abuse and wanted to 
escape, she could not disclose because the offender threatened her and her family.
Support services
It is essential to understand the perceived quality, usefulness and accessibility of support services 
related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online. This section presents some insights on these 
elements, followed by a more detailed overview of the different types of support services provided in 
Colombia, taking into account both the experiences of young survivors within these services as well 
as the views of frontline workers providing them.
Usefulness, quality, availability and awareness of support services
All of the young people who engaged in the conversations accessed support services from Fundación 
Renacer and Colombian Institute of Family Welfare in the city of Cartagena. They said that, once they 
knew about and accessed the services, the availability of support was very useful for them to recover. 
One young man said that the psychological support was what helped him the most:“Are trapped in fear of harming their families. ”   
(VoS-COL-07)
“I came to Renacer through a friend. At first, I didn’t want to come; but I wanted to see 
the light at the end of the tunnel. The attention was excellent. What helped me the 
most as a person was the therapeutic part, [learn] how to become a better person, 
how to love yourself, how to value yourself. ”   
(VoS-COL-03)
“Counselling is provided; they are later taken to a medical centre, followed by the 
report to the authorities; rights will be restored, and finally, family members are 
accompanied to file a complaint with the nation’s attorney general. ”27

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaWhen asked about the quality of government activities to address child sexual exploitation and abuse 
online in Colombia, frontline workers provided some criticisms, particularly of government financial 
support. Most of the respondents (78%, n=58) rated the quality of government funding on this topic 
as either “poor” or non-existent.
The frontline workers also expressed dissatisfaction with both the availability and quality of medical, 
psychological, legal and reintegration services for children who have experienced online forms of 
sexual exploitation and abuse in Colombia. Responses on medical and psychological services were 
more positive, with around 26-32% of frontline workers rating the availability and quality of these 
services as either “good” or “excellent” . However, all four sets of services were rated as “poor” in 
terms of availability and quality by between 38%-56% of frontline workers, suggesting a broad need for 
improvement. One of them commented: Figure 8: Frontline workers’ views on the quality of government activities.

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaTypes of support services
Psychological support 
As previously mentioned in this report, psychological support was very much appreciated by the 
young people who engaged in the conversations. All of them recognised this type of support as key to 
helping them overcome the impacts of online sexual exploitation and abuse. In the conversations, the 
young people expressed appreciation and emphasised the importance of these services for survivors 
in terms of rehabilitation and reintegration. Referring to his psychologist, one young man said: 
“She arrived and brightened my life. ”  
(VoS-COL-07)
“She [the psychologist] treated me like a human being, she made me understand that 
I was important, she showed me the things I had to overcome, she touched my heart. 
We made a good connection, it helped me to tell my mother that I was homosexual, it 
helped me to be free. ”   
(VoS-COL-04)They mentioned personal growth, self-acceptance and self-knowledge as the main accomplishments 
after going through psychological assistance. 
Indeed, surveyed frontline workers said that children who experienced online sexual exploitation and 
abuse most commonly identified counselling among their biggest needs (49%, n=45). A respondent 
elaborated that children need 
“Psychological assistance - Protective environment where children and adolescents 
feel safe from their offender. ”

Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaPsychological support was also considered essential by the frontline workers who responded to the 
survey. In the hypothetical scenarios, counselling/psychotherapy was frequently noted. For example, 
providing qualitative input on one of the scenarios,12 a worker said that 
In Colombia, it was really encouraging to see that in some cases, family members also had access to 
psychological support. In the conversations, one young woman said that in a family therapy session 
she could tell her mother about the sexual exploitation that she had been subjected to. Another one 
mentioned that all members of her support network – including mother, father, siblings and aunt – 
participated in psychotherapy sessions, which she considered essential for her recovering process as 
they created a caring and trusting relationship: 
A young man mentioned that the psychological support that he and his family received helped them 
to accept his sexual orientation and understand his situation. Describing the impact of the family 
therapeutic process, he said: 
Commenting about a situation where the family members were not involved, one young person 
mentioned feeling lonely and, once their father was included in the sessions the situation became 
better. However, some young people felt that family members could be better supported and 
monitored, particularly when they lived in other cities or were not motivated in participate in the 
therapeutic process.
12. Scenario question: Bernard, who lives in Australia, pays a 16-year-old in Colombia, Ana, to undress while they are on a video call. Do you 
believe that Ana is a victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse? […] What practical steps would you take if you were the service 
provider supporting 16-year-old Ana?“A therapy process would have to be carried out with the adolescent so that she 
can understand that she was sexually exploited online, taking into account that 
they used this medium to obtain the material as well as a psychosocial process that 
allows the adolescent to be in a safe space. ”
“They care about me, but they give me freedom, I can go out alone; they trust me. ”   
(VoS-COL-17)
“Thanks to that, I am who I am. ”    
(VoS-COL-10)
“My family wasn’t there at the beginning, nobody found out. I had no one, I was on 
the street. Later my father got involved thanks to the intervention of social workers. 
They improved many things. The involvement of the family changed a lot; however, the 
families lacked more follow-up after discharge; a telephone call isn’t sufficient. ”    
(VoS-COL-03)31
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe psychological support services secured the young people’s emotional and psychological state 
in the aftermath of the online sexual exploitation and abuse experiences and were considered 
essential for their recovery process. It is worth noting, however, that the young people also noted 
that psychological services are not sufficiently accessible and available to all children who have gone 
through the experience of online sexual exploitation and abuse:
Indeed, this was the case for a number of young people who engaged in the conversations who lost 
interest in studies after facing such trauma. Some young people mentioned in the conversations that 
as part of the psychological support that they accessed, they were encouraged to go back to school 
and to improve their academic performance. 
Emphasising the importance of the personal growth obtained in her recovery process, one young 
woman said: 
The young people highlighted in the conversations the need to strengthen sexual education in schools. 
One of them described the type of sexual education that she had at school as only focused on avoiding 
pregnancy, with no mention to the risks involved in the use of the Internet or how to identify a situation 
of sexual exploitation and abuse. “There were a lot of children and very few psychologists; more therapy which is 
more continuous, intense and frequent was needed. A single psychologist had to 
attend many children. This [having more psychologists] would have helped them to 
overcome their problems more quickly. ”     
(VoS-COL-10)
“If they prepare our personal growth, we have a solid basis to go out into the world 
later on […] Personally I want to finish school, study interior design or psychology. ”     
(VoS-COL-10)
“Apart from studies and professional training, first you have to be a person”     
(VoS-COL-03)Educational and pedagogical support 
When asked what were the biggest problems shared to them by children who experienced sexual 
exploitation and abuse online, most of the surveyed frontline workers mentioned fear, trauma and 
anxiety (25%, n=23), followed by social isolation/marginalisation (25%, n=23) and lack of assistance/
information/services (18%, n=19). Providing qualitative inputs to the survey about social isolation, one 
frontline worker commented that it is 
“Not easy to go back to school. ”32
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in Colombia“Sexuality is not discussed in the family, between parents and their children, at 
school, with teachers. If sexuality was discussed more frequently, children would not 
see it as sin, as bad thing and they would not be deceived so easily. ”    
(VoS-COL-04)
“The school can play an important role; psychologists can train students as peer 
support. Older students can train children; among young people they understand 
each other more, but they must be supervised by someone. ”     
(VoS-COL-01)The frontline workers’ survey included a hypothetical scenario involving educational institutions.13 A 
quarter of the frontline workers (26%, n=24) expressed that the school should be informed whenever a 
child is subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse. When asked about the practical steps that should 
be taken to deal with such situations, one of the respondents answered:
The import role that schools could play in preventing child sexual exploitation and abuse online was 
mentioned in the conversations. One young woman proposed that educational spaces could organise 
peer support trained by specialised psychologists: 
Unfortunately, school teachers and the pedagogical staff were mentioned as not supportive of 
or cooperative with children in their experiences. One young woman told us that she used to go to 
school to escape from situations of violence within her family, but no one at school was attentive to 
the changes in her behaviour at the time. She did not know the school psychologist and did not have 
anyone to talk. School psychologists are often the first point of call for young people and can facilitate 
referral to other services. Additionally, the education system should work as a protection mechanism 
for children, enabling a sense of belonging and stability.14 Without easy access to these professionals, 
gaining entry to the support structures can be difficult, particularly as children simply do not know 
how and where to start.
13. Scenario question: Carmen is a 17-year-old student. Carmen has struggled to make good grades this year and is worried that Juan, a 
teacher who is a close family friend, will tell Carmen’s dad. Carmen offers to send Juan naked pictures if he promises not to talk to the 
family. Do you think that Carmen is a victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse?
14. London Metropolitan University. (2017). Key messages from research on child sexual exploitation: Professionals in school settings. 5.“Psychosocial approach to obtain data on the exploitation situation; report to 
directors of the Institution; carry out an approach with the family; activate legal 
channels; awareness so that Carmen is recognised as a victim and establish the 
relevance those practices. ”33
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaLegal support 
Even though all nine young people who engaged in the conversations had received legal support, only 
three mentioned this type of assistance. In all these three cases, the young people said that the legal 
support helped them to understand that they had been subjected to a form of sexual exploitation 
and abuse. For instance, one young woman said that the legal support that she received helped her 
to feel relieved and to recognise herself as a victim, after a long time of self-blaming and self-harming 
behaviour. In another situation, a young man considered that the police and prosecutors acted 
diligently, initiating the process of restoration of his rights and prosecuting the offenders, who were 
arrested for these crimes.
 Unfortunately, noy all the experiences involving legal support were positive. One young man mentioned 
that although he did have access to this type of support, he felt left in the dark about the process, as 
those providing legal services did not communicate often with him or his family. 
As shown earlier in this report, in Figure 7, 46% (n=41) of the surveyed frontline workers reported that 
their organisations offer legal support for children who have experienced sexual exploitation and 
abuse. 
Legal assistance was among the very first steps that should be taken, according to the surveyed 
frontline workers, in all the scenario-based questions, which involved cases of child sexual exploitation 
and abuse online. When asked about the practical steps to take as service providers to help a fictitious 
female adolescent subjected to live streaming of child sexual abuse,15 legal action was raised by 60% 
of the surveyed frontline workers (n=51). Describing the necessary steps, one respondent listed:
“Immediate activation of the health channels; Initial care; Guidance to the family 
on legal actions (complaint) and process for the restoration of rights; Referral to 
psychotherapeutic care. ”
15. Scenario question: Bernard, who lives in Australia, pays a 16-year-old in Colombia, Ana, to undress while they are on a video call. Do you 
believe that Ana is a victim of online child sexual exploitation or abuse?34
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaFinancial support 
Frontline workers were asked whether child victims of online sexual exploitation and abuse have the 
possibility to seek formal financial compensation via civil or criminal court proceedings, whether from 
convicted perpetrators or country-managed funds. More than a half of the respondents (55%, n=49) 
indicated that they did not know the answer, while 26% (n=23) responded positively. In Colombia, 
article 11 of the Code of Penal Procedure states that all victims of any crime, once the conviction is 
final, have the right to receive compensation for the crime suffered.16

RECOMMENDATIONS 36
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe recommendations presented below are primarily drawn from the conversations with the young 
people who took part in the conversations. While the survey with frontline workers raised important 
issues and supported the analysis, this report seeks to privilege the voices and perspectives of 
survivors. Additional clarification and explanations from the analyses are provided in places from the 
project partners contributed during the analysis and write-up stage.
Recommendations on reporting mechanisms
1. Promote information and awareness about risks in the online environment 
related to sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as about reporting 
mechanisms and available support services when harm occurs.
It is necessary to
2. Provide educational programmes for communities and family members 
about prevention of online forms of sexual exploitation and abuse. 
For all of the young people who engaged in the conversations, the family plays an important role both 
in the prevention and protection of children. Therefore, it is crucial that family members have the 
capacity to educate children about the risks of Internet usage. It is also important that they create 
spaces of dialogue where children feel confident to disclose, and know how to guide children subjected 
to sexual exploitation and abuse in the process of reporting.“Reach the communities with the message of prevention, recognition of these 
crimes and promote reporting, allowing more and more people to learn about the 
issue, commit themselves and support the defence of children’s rights and the 
report of the offenders. ” 
(VoS-COL-02)
“Today it’s easier for the problem to arise because parents ignore the role of 
educating their children; they don’t see the dangers on social media. ”          
(VoS-COL-01)This recommendation was supported by the surveyed frontline workers. When provided the opportunity 
to share any last thoughts at the end of the survey, almost a half (45%, n=40) emphasised the lack of 
general public awareness related to this topic as a major issue in Colombia. One of them said that:
“It is about the lack of knowledge about the crimes classified as sexual violence; it is 
important to provide support from prevention in order to gradually mitigate cases of 
sexual violence in a joint manner; this includes the family, the state and the society. ”37
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaThe surveyed frontline workers also mentioned family members need to be better informed in order 
to prevent such crimes: 
In order to create these resources, one frontline worker recommended consulting children to make 
sure that their needs are taken into account.3. Improve the availability and dissemination of reporting mechanisms, 
creating child-friendly tools and making use of digital methods. 
The reporting mechanisms should be as accessible as possible and available in easy-to-use online 
formats. 
4. Impose legal duties on and promote collaboration with Internet service 
providers and social media companies. 
These requirements ensure that providers will promptly comply with law enforcement requests for 
takedown of child sexual abuse material as well as to comply promptly with law enforcement requests 
for information. This will assist investigations into crimes and limit the wide distribution of child sexual 
abuse material.  
In the conversations, young people said that social networks and other digital media do not display 
any prevention suggestions. According to the young people, they also do not respond to complaints 
other than sometimes blocking content. They therefore recommend that Internet providers should 
have visible information on the risks associated to Internet usage.“I believe that victims should be heard. Many formulations are made based on the 
thoughts of some people, without considering the needs of the victims. Resources 
for the care of children and adolescents are scarce and governments are resorting to 
stringer campaigns to position themselves politically, and to ensure resources reach 
the childhood. ”“To a large extent, crimes related to technological means give merit to the lack of 
knowledge from the legal, assistance, and guidance perspective, and the support 
that the family provides and to prevent children from becoming network victims. ” 
“Information must be increased, the permanent dissemination of digital channels or 
complaints. Create an easily accessible chat to report or make an application. ”
(VoS-COL-10)38
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in ColombiaRecommendations on support services
5. Better promote the availability of a full range of specialised support 
services for children subjected to sexual exploitation and abuse online.
Any child who goes through such an experience should have access to specialists who can help them. 
These professionals should be specialised and know the specifics of these cases.  
“The care programmes which exist are insufficient, there is a need for more, 
because there are many children who come to services for help and information, 
and they don’t know how to talk and who to tell. Care centres should be developed 
in the most vulnerable sectors. ”
(VoS-COL-09)
Lack of specialised support services was also highlighted by one surveyed frontline worker: 
A surveyed frontline worker emphasised the limited trained professionals: “One of the challenges that children and adolescents, victims of sexual abuse or 
sexual exploitation face is the late psychology support from the health sector due to 
the poor quality provided by this service and they do not have a professional hired to 
do so. ”
“The challenges in terms of care is training for public servants and identification of 
cases to ensure they do not get confused with other types of violence. Having the 
support of the pages for the reporting purposes creates awareness among the police 
and state agencies to address these problems. ”“Officials don’t have empathy, they don’t understand the consequences of violence, 
they re-victimise. They lack training. ” 
(VoS-COL-10)6. Commit financial resources to provide training and capacity building 
opportunities to law enforcement officers and legal professionals on 
topics related to child sexual exploitation and abuse online.
Both the young people who engaged in the conversations and the frontline workers who responded to 
the survey spoke about the need to improve the capacities of service providers. 39
Child sexual exploitation and abuse online: 
Survivors’ Perspectives in Colombia7. Improve the investigation and prosecution of online sexual crimes against 
children.
Law enforcement should improve approaches to conducting investigations of online forms of child 
sexual abuse and exploitation. Improvements are needed to ensure offenders are brought to justice 
and that those who have been subjected to such crimes are able to access compensation and other 
legal remedies. This would also encourage other children to report sexual abuse and exploitation.
“I believe that for this crime, despite the increased number of victims, the actions 
implemented are insufficient; the victims are unknown; there is lack of commitment 
of parents regarding prevention; there is lack of reaction of legal entities for 
the prosecution of the offenders and this last point involves a series of terrible 
consequences for the victims, on how much the population believes in the importance 
of the complaint and increases the probability of having new victims. ”You can ﬁnd more information on our website

ChildProtection,1012.txt," 1 Side event on the Rights of the Child: Children's Rights in the Digital Environment  
14 October 2020, 8.30am -10.00am  NY time  
 
Online interactive panel, via zoom hosted by UNICEF  
 
Convened by The Delegation of the European Union to the United Nations, the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the United 
Nations, and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)  
 
 
 
On 14 October 2020, the  EU Delegation to the UN and the Permanent Mission of Uruguay to the UN, in collaboration with UNICEF, 
hosted a forward -looking side event panel discussion in the margins of the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly on the 
Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Children. The panel discussion followed the 12 October Interactive Dialogue, where 
UNICEF Deputy  Executive Director Charlotte Petri Gornitzka presented the  Report on the Status of the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child  and other child rights reports at the Third Committee.  
The panel focused on  children’s rights in the digital environment .  
 
This topic is particularly relevant today with the global COVID -19 pandemic that has resulted in millions of children increasingly relying 
on online tools, systems and platforms in multiple ways important to  their lives. These range from the infrastructural — facilitating 
education, healthcare, and food reaching plates — to the social – children connecting to learn, to play, and to stay in touch with their 
family and friends. This increased reliance also cont inues to expose children to the risk of violence, exploitation and abuse (including 
sexual exploitation and abuse) and has made explicit the existing ‘digital divide’ and deep -seated and systemic inequalities.  
 
This topic was  prominently reflected in the Secretary -General's report on the Rights of the Child and will be the focus  of the upcoming 
General Comment 25 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
The event  was moderated by Mr. Andrew Morley, President and CEO of Worl d Vision International and attracted over 80 participants  
from Member States, Civil Society Organizations, UNICEF and other UN entities.  
 
 2 In their opening statements both the EU and Uruguay representatives noted that the biennalisation of the GA resolutio n on the 
promotion and protection of the rights of children does not mean that it should disappear from our radar screen, and that on the 
contrary it is   crucial to maintain the space for child rights, including through this type of events.  
The panelists touched on a range of opportunities and risks for child rights as induced by the digital environment.  
 
Mr. Manus de Barra, Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary -General on Violence against Children  focused his 
intervention on the protectio n of children online and the need for an inclusive and empowering digital agenda for children.  
 
Ms. Amal Aldoseri, Vice -Chair, Committee on the Rights of the Child  gave an overview of the upcoming General Comment on children’s 
rights in the digital enviro nment that the Committee on the Rights of the Child is currently preparing.  
 
Mr. Robert Jenkins, UNICEF Associate  Director, Education spoke about the opportunities to advance quality learning and education 
through the use of digital technologies and platforms but also the inherent inequalities in terms of access to tools, technologies, and 
learning support.  
 
Mr. Ahmed Mihaimeed, Project manager of Digital Village, SOS Children’s Village  International  shared the experience of Digital V illage 
which helps provide access to technology for vulnerable children and their caregivers in order to bridge the digital divide a s well as 
support to ensure that their online safety remains a priority.  
 
Mr. Kenneth Brent Villa, Trust & Safety Counsel i n Adobe, and President of the Technology  Coalition ; and Ms. Alicia Blum -Ross, Public 
Policy Lead, Kids and Families in Google, and  Research Chair of the Technology Coalition  shared their perspectives on the role of the 
private sector in regard to the promotion and protection of child rights in the digital space with a particular focus on init iatives in place 
to fight sexual exploitation and abuse online .  
 
The main takeaways of the discussion included:  
 
• We need to build a safe, secure, inclusive digital environment for all children that is also human rights compliant.  
• Internet was not created for children but has become an essential tool for their development.  
• Member States have a primary role to play in  promoting and protecting child rights online.  
 3 • The rights of the child in the digital environment are the same as in real life but to be able to guarantee them we need a de ep 
understanding of the complexities brought in by the digital world.  
• Technology and  digital tools can help children reach their potential, but safe digital spaces for children are needed. This 
requires governments, private sector, and civil society working together. Supporting children’s rights online is truly a 
partnership effort.  
• We ne ed to put the participation of children in the heart of any process that we get engaged in.  
• ‘There is no one country or stakeholder that can ensure child safety online by itself; and there is not one specific way that  we 
should follow”. It is important tho ugh that we systematically bring in a multi -stakeholder approach and use a child -rights 
framework.  
 
The discussion was followed by a rich Q and A session.

not mean that it should disappear from our radar screen. We decided to hold this event this year 
anyway in order to maintain the discussion alive on child rights.  
• COVID 19  had reminded us of the opportunities offered by the digital world but also the risks 
(exacerbated vulnerabilities of children to abuse, violence etc. including sexual abuse)  
• It is about the digital dividends but also the digital divide  
• Question: Can we bu ild a safe, secure, inclusive digital environment for all children that is also human 
rights compliant?

Child Protection 
Officer, Office of 
the SRSG on 
Violence Against  
Children  (on 
behalf of the 
SRSG)  • Focused his intervention on children protection online  
• Internet: opportunities  to learn, create, acce ss, etc.  but also multiple  risks  faced online  
• Pandemic has magnified some risks, such as child SEA  
• Child sexual abuse; true scale of the problem unknown because underreported and under 
prosecuted; data we have deeply concerning  
• Interpol warned that it has worsened problem in many ways: reporting decr easing; increased 
opportunities for offenders to connect; etc.  
• Other risks for children online: cyberbullying; inappropriate collection and use of children data; 
and sharing of inappropriate content  
• Child rights -based approach  and framework a nd Multi -stake holder approach needed to address 
challenges  
• Useful tools to guide our action: ITU updated its guidance; an interagency agenda for action for 
protecting children online during the covid pandemic; and the GC will bring an authoritative guidance 
on what a ri ght- based approach involves  
• Children’s views and concerns must be heard : The empowerment of children must be at the heart of 
our approach; we should provide enabling pathways for children to become agents of change in that 
context; they need access to res ources which is also the case of caregivers and parents.  
• Reminder that we all have a role to play:  
o States: protection, child -friendly services,  law enforcement and  justice  
o Private  sector : “safety by design must be a key element of their services” ; ensure proactive protection  
o Essential role that civil society plays, particularly through advocacy, running helplines and hotlines  
o ‘There is no one country or stakeholder that can do it by itself; and there is not one specific way”  
 
Amal Aldoseri,  
Vice -Chair,  
Committee on the 
Rights of the Child  • The rights of the child in real life are the same as in the digital environment  but to be able to 
guarantee them we need a deep understanding of the complexities  
• Internet not created for children, but has be come an essential tool for their development  
• In charge of coordinating the drafting of the upcoming General Comment (25) on children’s rights in 
the digital environment; gave an overview of what the General Comment 25 will be addressing:  
• Discrimination in  accessing the digital world  (e.g. for children living in economically challenged 
families; children with disabilities; children living in rural areas etc.)  exacerbated by pandemic   6 • Competition between some rights, i.e., the right to be heard, the right to freedom of 
expression, the right to privacy, against the right to protection  
▪ Rights should not be in competition with each other  
• Resilience, which is necessary for children’s healthy development  
• Business sector must meet responsibilities to children’s righ ts, including data  
• States play primary role  
• Children have right to receive guidance and support when engaging in digital activities from the state 
and family  
• States should adapt school curricula to make it more compatible with digital era  
• General Comment o n children’s rights in relation to digital environment, available for public comment 
until Nov. 15  
 
 
Robert Jenkins,  
Associate Director 
Education, UNICEF  • Opportunities to advance learning and education through digital but also challenges that come along  
• Highlighting the potential of technology in the context of education  
• Global learning crisis prior to pandemic  (great success with increasing access to school that did not 
necessarily translate into learning outcomes that we had hoped for); Covid 19 e xacerbated the 
learning crisis, and will have potentially life long implications for children with 24 million children that 
may not be returning to school  
• But it also presents opportunities. “UNICEF believes...that we are presented with a once in a 
generat ion opportunity to leapfrog education opportunities into the future.”  
• Can seize this moment  
• Strong partnerships across world, countries and communities to address learning crisis  
• Renewed commitment to reach the most marginalized children  
• New openness of go vernments, ministries of education, partners, to reimagine education  
• We can “transform and revolutionize education” – provide a modern education  
▪ More interest -based, self -paced (meet individual needs of child, child’s context)  
▪ Shift towards more skill-focused (foundational, transferable, digital, entrepreneurial, 
job-specific)  
▪ Platform to offer a  holistic range of support, leveraging school s (education is the most 
widely spread government service reaching children)   7 • Including psycho -social, mental,  physical, nutritional needs (school meals)  
• Pandemic has impacted these services  
• Increasing inequalities and vulnerabilities, need to promote universality in future, reaching all 
children and youth  
• Employing effective and appropriate technology = key for f uture of education  
• Eliminate digital divide, connect all children  
 
Vina Barahman, 
UNICEF  (taking 
over for Rob)  • Partners are critical  to reimagine education  
• ED note: “ how important the moment is to leverage the possibilities offered to us by technology which 
can be an  incredible and historic equalizer if we get it right”

Digitalization and Digital Literacy in Indonesia
The number of Internet users in Indonesia has increased significantly in recent years. Between 2015 and 2019, 
Internet users increased by 22%. In 2019, 43.5% of the 270 million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet 
(Statistics Indonesia, 2020a). While the greatest increase comes from people living in urban areas, where the 
number of users increased by 53%, rural areas have also experienced a steady rise, increasing by 31%. 
Young people have also enjoyed increasing access to the Internet. In the past four years, the percentage of 
Indonesian students aged 5–24 years who have access to the Internet increased sharply from 33.98% to 59.3% 
(Statistics Indonesia, 2020b) (Graph 1). Slightly more than a quarter of Internet users (25.5%) are children and 
adolescents. • To strengthen students’ digital literacy, the 
Ministry of Education and Culture and the 
Ministry of Religious  Affairs need to improve the 
curriculum for teaching ICT. This requires the 
participation of the Ministry of Communications 
and Informatics and non-government actors 
with special expertise in digital solutions. It has 
to apply a new approach of cultivating critical 
thinking skills in the classroom, improving 
teachers’ capacities in both ICT and critical 
thinking, and introducing basic digital literacy 
skills for parents. • The Ministry of Education and Culture, and 
the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to 
cooperate with the Ministry of Communication 
and Informatics on expanding technology and 
Internet access, especially for students living 
in rural areas. This requires the cooperation of 
the private sector.

Digital activity has also surged. A survey conducted by Hootsuite and We are Social (2021) reveals that Indonesian 
respondents aged 16-64 years old spend an average of 7 hours and 52 minutes on the Internet every day. This is 
higher than the global average of 6 hours and 54 minutes per day. Indonesia ranks 8th out of 42 surveyed countries 
in terms of most time spent on the Internet, higher than Singapore and Vietnam and lower than the Philippines 
and Malaysia. 
Children are also well engaged on the Internet, especially in social media. Focus group interviews in Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand conducted by UNICEF (2020) found that many children manage multiple social 
media accounts for entertainment, communication, and education purposes. Some of them are not only consumers 
but also content creators.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, digital activities have expanded and intensified as many people have had to shift 
to online solutions. For example, new digital consumers in e-commerce in Indonesia increased as much as 37% 
during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 (Google et al., 2020; Ministry of Trade, 2020). Due to long-term school 
closures, educational activity has also shifted online, especially in urban areas. As a result, children are exposed 
to an expanded range of digital content and products and become a more important segment of online consumers. 
However, the remarkable growth of Internet use in Indonesia has not necessarily corresponded with improved 
digital literacy. This refers not only to the ability to use technology, such as skills to use devices, software and 
the basic use of the Internet. It also includes digital literacy skills that revolve around the ability to understand, 
evaluate, and responsibly use information acquired from digital sources, which is the subject of this policy brief. 
Considering the premature development of digital literacy in Indonesia, this brief will not engage in a discussion 
of more advanced levels of digital literacy that require an understanding of cybersecurity, digital citizenship, data 
privacy, etc.
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (2020a), Indonesia ranks 61st out of 100 countries for its level of 
education and preparedness to use the Internet. Indonesia’s position is lower than neighboring countries such 
as Singapore and Malaysia, which rank 22nd and 33rd, respectively. The low level of digital literacy in Indonesia, 
especially in rural areas, limits what Internet users can meaningfully do when they are online and may exacerbate 
the digital divide1 (Purbo, 2017).
1 Digital divide is a gap between individuals, families, enterprises, and geographical areas at various socio-economic levels in terms of both their access 
to information and communication technology (ICT) resources and their use of the Internet for any purposes. Source: Statistics Indonesia (2020b).Figure 1.

The Urgency of Digital Literacy Improvement
As Internet use pervades every aspect of life, the urgency of improving digital literacy increases. This includes 
improving understanding of how to use digital products in a responsible manner and taking advantage of 
opportunities and resources available on the Internet. There is wide agreement that users must be equipped with 
the skills needed to maximize the benefits from their online activities (Purbo, 2017). Building these skills can 
begin at a young age, especially when children are already exposed to the Internet.
Children are quite agile in their technology use, but this does not necessarily translate to maturity in content 
consumption and engagement. Many online platforms are not designed for children and there are hardly any 
barriers to prevent their accessing inappropriate content. Without a thorough understanding of digital literacy, 
children may be susceptible to online threats and harmful content including hoaxes and misinformation, 
cyberbullying, online fraud, and even sexual exploitation. 
Awareness of hoaxes and misinformation is especially relevant in light of the societal threats posed by populist 
and radical internet content that can threaten democratic norms and institutions. As future voters, citizens, and 
political participants, children must be prepared to confront and recognize dangerous and misleading content 
and sources. 
In addition to preventing immediate online harm, acquiring digital literacy at an early age prepares children to 
become consumers of online goods and services. In the interest of future consumer protection, children should 
be equipped with the ability to critically assess online terms and conditions and understand consumer rights, and 
data privacy. The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index ( Indeks Keberdayaan Konsumen/IKK ) stood at 41.70 
in 2019.2 This score indicates that Indonesian consumers understand their role but are not yet critical in terms of 
using their rights and obligations (Ministry of Trade, 2020). Improving digital literacy among children can help to 
improve performance on this index in the future.
Digital literacy is also important because it opens the door to employment opportunities and facilitates the 
mastery of other essential skills (Karpati, 2011). Digitalization constantly creates and transforms jobs throughout 
the labor market. Digital literacy skills give students the ability to thrive in this dynamic digital environment. 
The Personal Data Protection Bill ( Rancangan Undang-Undang Perlindungan Data Pribadi/RUU PDP ) under 
development in the Indonesian House of Representatives considers introducing a minimum age of 17 years for 
setting up a social media account without parental consent (Sari, 2020). This policy is intended to protect children 
from harmful internet content, but it will have the effect of reducing opportunities to build digital literacy that will 
allow them to innovate and thrive in the modern world. Equipping children with digital literacy will help them to 
be digitally resilient, to make responsible decisions, and to optimize the benefits of spending their time online. 
2 The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index (IKK) measures consumers’ ability to empower themselves. The IKK index is grouped into 5 scoring 
systems: 1. Aware—recognize their rights and obligations as consumers (0.0–20.0); 2. Understand—understand their rights and obligations to protect 
themselves (20.01–40.0); 3. Capable—able to decide the best choices as consumers and prioritize local products (40.1–60.0); 4. Critical—actively defend 
their rights and prioritize local products (60.1–80.0); 5. Empowered—actively defending consumers’ interest in interacting with the market (80.1–100.0).5
Teaching Digital Literacy Skills in Indonesia 
Digital literacy is strongly dependent on basic literacy skills—reading and writing comprehension. Unfortunately, 
Indonesia consistently performs poorly in literacy. Fifteen-year-old Indonesian students surveyed in the 
Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) 2018 ranked 71st out of 79 countries. Only 30% 
demonstrated at least level 2 proficiency3 in reading, compared to the OECD average of 77% (OECD, 2019). On 
the other hand, 70% of Indonesian adults living in Jakarta perform at or below level 1 in literacy, according to the 
Survey of Adult Skills (PIIAC) (OECD, 2016). These surveys highlight that, while the majority of Indonesians can 
understand simple texts using basic vocabulary, they have difficulty understanding and critically evaluating long 
and complex texts. 
A contributing factor toward low literacy levels is the lack of emphasis on critical thinking skills in the school 
curriculum. The National Curriculum 2013 mandates the implementation of High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) 
but it is not well-integrated into or widely taught during teacher training in Indonesia (Ilyas, 2015). In practice, 
Indonesian education focuses on older approaches to learning, such as memorization (WENR, 2019; UNICEF, 
2017).
In addition to the problems of low literacy and poor critical thinking skills in the general population, digital 
literacy education is largely missing from Indonesian schools. Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) was included as a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum 2006 (also known as Kurikulum Tingkat 
Satuan Pendidikan  or KTSP), but content was limited to basic skills such as how to use a computer, computer 
applications, and devices to support study activities. In 2013, the Ministry of Education removed ICT from the list 
of compulsory subjects in the National Curriculum 2013 with the intention of integrating ICT learning across all 
school subjects (Bona, 2018). However, many public schools responded by dropping the subject altogether (Purbo, 
2017). Teachers of other subjects were unable to incorporate ICT into their lesson plans because their own ICT 
skills and knowledge were insufficient, whereas ICT teachers were confused by the removal of the subject from 
the National Curriculum 2013 (Subekti, Yudha, & Luqman 2016). As a result, many Indonesian students have 
received no education in ICT.
The inequality of Internet access across the different regions of Indonesia and the socioeconomic conditions of 
Indonesians are the major structural challenges for the improvement of digital literacy. First, the percentage of 
households that can access the Internet is the highest on the most densely populated island of Java while it is 
much lower in the eastern parts of Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia, 2019b), as illustrated in Figure 2. 
3 PISA 2018 has a scale of 1–6 to indicate reading proficiency. The scale 1 consists of 1a, 1b, 1c, indicating the proficiency of understanding simple text 
with literal meaning. Scale 2 indicates the ability to identify the meaning of moderate-length text. Scale 3 indicates the ability to understand multiple texts. 
Scale 4 students can understand indirect cues and nuances in a single or multiple texts. Scale 5 students are able to compare the meaning of multiple, 
lengthy texts. Scale 6 indicates the ability to understand long and abstract texts and use multiple criteria to validate the information. 6
Source: Statistics Indonesia (2019b)Figure 2. 
Internet Access (percent) per Household by Province in Indonesia (2019). 
Internet users are predominantly households with higher incomes. They are more likely to afford and access 
devices and internet subscriptions (Bachtiar et al., 2020). Lack of Internet access is strongly linked to low levels of 
digital literacy. Inexperienced users are unlikely to be as competent or resilient as those who use the Internet on a 
daily basis. Expanding access, especially to disadvantaged communities, is crucial for digital literacy improvement.
The inequality of access is also visible in the education sector. According to Statistics Indonesia (2018), only 
69% of primary and junior secondary schools and 74% of senior secondary schools have access to the Internet. 
This results in low and widely varying levels of ICT competence and digital literacy among Indonesian teachers 
(Widodo & Riandi, 2013 cited in Koh et al., 2018). DKI Jakarta

Current Efforts to Mainstream Digital Literacy in 
Indonesia
Improving digital literacy is one of five priorities in the government’s plan to accelerate the digital transformation 
in Indonesia (Cabinet Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020). However, there is no solid set of policies or 
clearly targeted outcomes related to digital literacy (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020b).
Efforts to increase digital literacy start from the basic level of increasing general literacy by nurturing the ability 
to understand, interpret, create, and communicate texts. They must also involve critical thinking skills and the 
ability to critically observe, analyse and interpret information and the logical connection between ideas, to support 
rational individual decision-making processes. Finally, and following a more specific definition of digital literacy, 
they require the ability to find, evaluate, use and create content on digital platforms.
Dealing with such a complex set of necessary skills involves programs and activities spread across government 
agencies. In Indonesia, this includes the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Religious Affairs as well 
as the Ministry of Communication and Informatics. 
In order to promote general literacy, the government has initiated programs such as the National Literacy 
Movement (Gerakan Literasi Nasional/GLN), established by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) in 2016. 
It includes the promotion of literacy in three areas: literacy in schools (Gerakan Literasi Sekolah/GLS), family 
(Gerakan Literasi Keluarga/GLK), and society (Gerakan Literasi Masyarakat/GLM). GLN was mandated through 
MOEC Regulation No. 23/2015 on Developing Character on Students with the purpose of synchronizing all literacy 
programs that have been running in each MOEC directorate and expanding public involvement in the development 
of literacy culture in Indonesia. The main focus on this movement is to cultivate reading habits of students.  
The GLN guidelines also addresses digital literacy and defines it as the skills to make use of information from 
digital sources in an accountable manner. It includes the aim of developing digital learning habits and improving 
the use of digital media in school education (GLN, 2017), but it does not seek to increase the skills to critically 
analyze and navigate digital sources. The evaluation of digital literacy according to the GLN guidelines merely 
assesses whether stakeholders have integrated digital sources and media in the learning process and their daily      
life (MOEC, 2017). 
Several MOEC regulations are of relevance in this context. Increasing digital literacy is not being directly 
addressed in the National Education Standards4, but critical thinking skills are included. MOEC Regulation No. 
20/2016 specified them as the basic competency standard required for primary and secondary school graduates. 
MOEC Regulation No. 21/2016 on the Standard of Content for Primary and Secondary Education also mentioned 
critical thinking skills as one of the indicators for mastering school subjects.   
While MOEC Regulation No. 22/2016 on the Standardized Process of Primary and Secondary Schools demands 
that the learning process must include activities of observing, questioning, and analysing, which are essentially 
critical thinking skills, these skills have not become an indicator to assess students’ competence in MOEC 
Regulation No. 23/2016 on the Education Assessment Standard.
4 National Education Standards are the minimum standards in Indonesia’s education system. They consist of eight standards: 1). Standard of content; 2). 
Standard of process; 3). Graduate competence standard; 4). Teachers and educational personnel standard; 5). Standard of facilities and infrastructure; 
6). Management standards; 7). Financing standards; 8). Educational assessment standards.8
A basic level of digital literacy training addresses the technical competence to use digital devices and software. In 
that regard, MOEC Regulation No. 37/20185 reintroduced ICT as an optional subject at the primary school level and 
made it a compulsory subject for junior and secondary middle schools (SMP/SMA) beginning in the 2019 academic 
year. However, deficiencies of the ICT curriculum with respect to digital literacy remain. The curriculum puts a 
strong focus on understanding and improving technical competence in areas such as programming, using office 
applications, and writing blog posts, while there is insufficient emphasis on how to responsibly and critically use 
these technologies.  The national curriculum has to be based on the National Education Standards, which include 
critical thinking skills. However, MOEC Regulation No. 37/2018MOEC does not integrate critical thinking skills in 
the ICT subject.  
For the schools under the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) such as Madrasah6, MORA Regulation No. 184/2019 
on Guideline of Curriculum Implementation in Madrasah has yet to include digital literacy in the curriculum. The 
subject that seems most suitable to convey digital literacy is informatics ( informatika ), but it is an optional and not 
a mandatory subject on junior and senior secondary levels of Madrasah. It is not offered on the primary education 
level. As for other institutions of Islamic education, such as Pesantren ,7 the curriculum is designed by the Kyai or 
prominent figures in the institution without the intervention of MORA (Azzahra, 2020). Pesantren  may teach ICT 
skills, but the exact number of pesantren  teaching ICT remains unknown. Most Pesantren  are traditional by nature 
anyway and unlikely to address digital technologies. There is no information available on how many Pesantren  are 
equipped with necessary facilities such as Internet and computers.   
Despite the lacking focus on digital literacy skills in the national curriculum, some schools, especially those 
operated by the private sector, have integrated digital literacy in advanced ICT classes. They go beyond the 
national curriculum requirements, when they teach 21st century skills such as digital citizenship, critical thinking 
and problem solving (Sampoerna Academy, n.d; British School Jakarta, n.d). Still, this will only be accessible 
for students from upper-income families. Most schools in Indonesia are not equipped with digital facilities and 
lack the human resources to teach students digital literacy and not just the functionalities of digital devices. 
Mainstreaming digital literacy must, therefore, go beyond the initiatives of individual schools and requires 
significant support from the government. 
More specifically addressing digital literacy, Ministry of Communication and Informatics (MOCI) initiated the 
National Digital Literacy Movement ( Gerakan Nasional Literasi Digital  or Siberkreasi ) to improve digital literacy 
skills in Indonesia. Siberkreasi is a multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at reducing misinformation and negative 
contents on the Internet through public awareness activities by private businesses, civil society organizations, 
etc.  As part of the movement, MOCI also provides online references and digital sources through the website 
literasidigital.id in the form of videos, articles, and e-books on digital literacy. It also encourages the government 
to include digital literacy in the school curriculum (MOCI, 2019a). 
As of 2019, 20,472 people had participated in offline Siberkreasi  programs, including seminars, workshops, and 
talk shows in 25 provinces. Audiences included both students and adults (MOCI, 2019b).  
5 This policy brief specifically addresses the curriculum after the ICT subject has been reintroduced
6 Madrasah is an Islamic education institution that teaches the national curriculum and uses methods similar to formal schools but also incorporate 
weekly hours of Islamic instructions. Madrasah are found on all levels of school education: primary (Madrasah Ibtidaiyah/MI), junior secondary 
(Madrasah Tsanawiyah/MTs), and senior secondary (Madrasah Aliyah/MA)
7 Pesantren  is a culturally-rooted Islamic educational institution in Indonesia characterized by its boarding school element and traditional method of 
teaching Islamic theological materials. 9
However, the scope of this program remains limited and it is unknown whether it has improved digital literacy. 
There is no program evaluation incorporated into Siberkreasi  and digital literacy has not yet been added to the 
school curriculum. 
In 2021, MOCI and its Siberkreasi  partners plan to publish a Digital Literacy Module 2021-2024 which covers four 
aspects of digital literacy, namely digital skills, digital safety, digital ethics, and digital culture.8 This module is 
supposed to provide practical tips on improving digital literacy skills. There will also be equipped with evaluation 
parts in every chapter to assess users’ understanding. 
8 The module is yet to behad not been published during the at the time of writing  process of this policy brief10
Policy Recommendations
• Create a comprehensive inter-ministerial 
framework for digital literacy
 MOCI and MOEC have cooperated in organizing 
events on digital literacy, however, despite 
the fact that both address the improvement of 
digital literacy, the National Literacy Movement 
and Siberkreasi  are largely separated from one 
another. There is a need to streamline efforts in 
a comprehensive inter-ministerial framework.  
• Improve digital literacy education in the school 
curriculum
 As ICT education was reintroduced in schools 
in 2019, MOEC and MORA should adjust the 
curriculum to fit the demands of the digital age. 
Students must be prepared to be responsible 
and literate digital citizens and consumers. 
The curriculum should prioritize cultivating the 
ethical and responsible use of technology as 
well as navigating myriad information in the 
digital settings.
 The curriculum should prioritize responsible 
information use and sharing, identification 
of trustworthy sources of information, and 
protecting students during their online activity. 
These skills are more relevant than the dated 
ICT content in the curriculum.
 Teaching material must be simplified and 
adjusted to the specific age groups in school, 
while also involving parents to guide and 
support their children in online activities. 
• Cultivate critical thinking across all school 
subjects
 Critical thinking skills are a crucial prerequisite 
to improving digital literacy. Critical thinking 
is necessary for understanding and verifying 
information from online sources. In developed 
countries such as Finland and Switzerland, 
critical thinking is an integral aspect of 
education. MOEC and MORA should rethink and 
provide guidance on how to better integrate 
critical thinking skills across all learning 
activities, while learning lessons from the 
shortcomings of this strategy for ICT education. 
Practices such as working collaboratively with 
peers, using HOTS content and questions for 
assignments and exams, and cultivating a 
habit of questioning, analyzing, and crafting 
arguments in discussion should be part of every 
classroom. • Include digital literacy and critical thinking in 
teachers’ training
 Digital literacy materials should be included in 
teachers’ training. Without improving the low 
overall ICT competence and critical thinking 
pedagogy among teachers, they will not be able 
to play their part in improving the digital literacy 
of students.   
• Equipping the parents with basic digital 
literacy skills
 Developing responsible online behavior starts 
at home. To be able to supervise the online 
activities of their children, parents must 
themselves know how to navigate social media, 
find reliable news, and critically assess the 
content. Parents need to have basic digital 
literacy skills because they are also not immune 
to digital threats. MOCI’s Siberkreasi  needs to 
create training modules and offer courses that 
target parents. 
• Cooperating with the private sector to 
formulate relevant curriculum content 
 The digital space is dynamic and ever-changing. 
The education sector has difficulty keeping up. In 
order to improve the dynamics of digital literacy 
education, MOEC and MORA should coordinate 
with MOCI and engage in partnerships with 
private sector experts. The private sector has 
been engaged in public seminars and talk 
shows through MOCI’s Siberkreasi  program, but 
not in improving the school curriculum. These 
external experts can help the government to 
formulate relevant indicators for the digital 
literacy contents skills in the school curriculum. 
• Improving access of technology to support 
digital inclusion
 Improving Internet access and technology, 
especially in rural parts of Indonesia, should 
remain a government priority in order to address 
the digital disparity and open up opportunities 
for disadvantaged families. MOCI is planning 
to equip about 12,000 villages with Internet 
access. Private sector involvement, which has 
been considered, should be encouraged. MOEC 
and MORA should also cooperate with the 
private sector to equip schools, especially in 
rural areas, with Internet access, laptops, and 
computers.11

ChildProtection,1014.txt,"Introduction
Ethiopia has undergone rapid transformation over the past two years. Soon after being appointed in 2018, Prime Minister 
Abiy Ahmed, an ethnic Oromo, effectively dissolved the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front, the party that 
had wielded absolute power since 1991, promising a restoration of political freedoms and peace with neighbouring Eritrea 
that was recognised with a Nobel Peace Prize (Gardner, 2020; Nobel Prize, 2019). That same year saw the appointment 
of Ethiopia’s first female president, Sahle-Work Zewde, and a cabinet in which half the positions are held by women. This 
new era has seen improvements in people’s rights to voice and association but has also been accompanied by increased 
insecurity and violence, which first erupted in 2015 and then spread throughout the country, leaving hundreds of people 
dead and millions displaced (Human Rights Watch, 2020).
This policy note synthesises findings from the Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE) programme’s 
2019/2020 round 2 data collection to explore changes in Ethiopian adolescents’ access to voice and agency in the 
midst of the country’s dramatic political transformation. It uses mixed-methods research that includes a survey (with 
7,538 adolescents and their caregivers) and 601 qualitative interviews (with adolescents, parents and service providers). 
Respondents were from three diverse rural regions – South Gondar (Amhara), East Hararghe (Oromia) and Zone 5 (Afar) 
– as well as three very different urban areas (Debre Tabor in Amhara, Batu in Oromia and Dire Dawa City Administration). 
We pay careful attention to gender and regional differences in how young people between the ages of 12 and 20 are 
accessing decision-making opportunities within the family and community. We also explore changes in adolescents’ 
mobility and access to safe space, and social interactions with peers, their access to age-appropriate information and digital

key actions needed to accelerate progress, especially for 
girls, if Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 – ‘women’s 
full and effective participation and equal opportunities for 
leadership at all levels’ – is to be achieved (United Nations, 
2020). 
Key findings
The broader changes unfolding across Ethiopia are 
reflected in myriad ways in adolescents’ lives. Since our 
baseline research in 2018, adolescents have become more 
comfortable speaking up for what they need, more involved 
in their communities, have more say over when they leave the 
house and where they go, enjoy better access to information, 
and are more likely to have a role model who inspires them. 
Changes have not, however, accrued uniformly to all groups 
of adolescents.
Voice and decision-making in the household 
and community
There has been substantial change over the past two years in 
adolescents’ ability to contribute to the decisions that shape 
their own lives, their households and their communities, 
although the patterning is complex. As expected, given that 
they are now two years older, considerably more younger 
adolescents (aged 12–14 years) reported feeling comfortable 
expressing their opinions to adults at midline (45%) than 
at baseline (29%). As also expected, girls (44%) were less 
comfortable voicing their opinions than boys (47%), and 
especially in the case of older adolescents (17–19 years) 
where the gender divide was greater (44% for girls compared 
to 50% for boys). This difference in the survey was, however, 
more muted than in the qualitative findings. Our qualitative research suggests that this relative parity 
between girls and boys reflects girls’ lower expectations 
rather than their actual input to decisions, with fathers 
admitting that they have very limited communication with 
their daughters and girls explaining that even their mothers 
have limited say. ‘What can I talk about with my daughter? 
There is nothing I talk about with her!’  exclaimed a father from 
Debre Tabor. ‘Some mothers exercise their rights. The power 
goes to fathers mostly,’  explained a married 17 -year-old girl 
from East Hararghe. Our findings further highlight that girls 
have very little say in the decisions that shape their lives, 
including whether and when to marry (see Box 1). ‘I cannot 
refuse. If I refuse the man who is going to marry me, he would 
be given permission to take me by force,’ emphasised a 
17 -year-old married girl from Zone 5 (Afar). 
Our survey found that differences in adolescents’ voice by 
location were more notable than gender and age differences, 
with those living in rural Amhara and urban areas far more 
comfortable with speaking up to adults than those living 
in rural Oromia (approximately one-half versus one-third). 
This same patterning is reflected in an index capturing 
adolescents’ perceived input into household decision-
making, which was higher in rural Amhara (4.8/8) than in any 
other location, especially compared to East Hararghe (3.8/8).2
Our qualitative work suggests that differences are 
shaped by both cultural norms and access to services. In 
Box 1: ‘I can take care of myself’
Marta is a 13-year-old girl, married at age 8 and now divorced, living in rural South Gondar. She is exceptional not because of the 
age at which she was married but because of her determination to make her voice heard against formidable family and community 
pressures. 
Marta was unable to refuse her marriage, which was arranged by her grandfather because he wanted to see the family line continue. 
But she drew the line at being made to leave school by her husband, who was nearly 10 years older and still studying himself. ‘I said 
to him, “What am I going to do if you finish your school and become a government worker and leave me? Am I going to end up being 
a farmer and take care of your babies?”’ 
Indeed, having heard that girls can get pregnant even before menarche, as soon as she was forced to become sexually active she 
went to the local health extension worker and demanded a contraceptive implant. ‘I asked her for the implant that lasts for three 
years… I didn’t want to give birth before I become mature and know myself better and become self-sufficient,’ she explained.
Determined to escape her marriage and illiteracy and to realise her aspiration of going to university, Marta stole grain from her 
in-laws and sold it to finance her escape. When she was caught by a cousin, she fought back: ‘I was beaten and forced to go back 
but I refused. I told them that I would commit suicide.’ Although her father and her in-laws tried to intimidate her into returning to 
her husband, Marta persisted. She was allowed to divorce and was preparing, before the disruptions brought by covid-19, to start 
secondary school.  I cannot refuse. If I refuse the 
man who is going to marry me, he 
would be given permission to take 
me by force.

East Hararghe, whereas initial explanations surrounding 
school dropout and child marriage emphasised adolescents’ 
voice and adults’ inability to exercise control, broader 
narratives highlighted how adolescent ‘choices’ are shaped 
by adults’ demands. ‘She has quit on her own. She doesn’t 
want to go to school,’ explained a 15-year-old in-school boy 
of his sister. ‘But there must be somebody to prepare foods 
and do all these tasks, so that our mother orders her to do 
those tasks.’ This view was reinforced by key informants. As 
a community leader in East Hararghe noted: ‘When boys and 
girls reach the age of adolescence, conflict arises between 
the mother and such children… Once mothers initiated the 
girls for marriage, girls will go with someone for marriage.’  
In South Gondar, where school enrolment rates are higher 
(91% of younger adolescents enrolled, compared to 78% 
in East Hararghe and 61% in Zone 5) and schools are more 
likely to have active clubs on topics including gender and 
civic participation, young people are more regularly exposed 
to messages about their rights – including their rights to an 
education and to remain unmarried. ‘They teach us about 
discipline, our rights and responsibilities and so on,’  observed 
a 15-year-old girl who is a member of her school’s civics club. 
‘I take part in school clubs… It is to get better knowledge,’  
added a 15-year-old girl who explained that she had drawn 
on this awareness to refuse a marriage arranged by her 
parents. In Zone 5 (Afar), pastoralist realities shape day-to-
day adolescent decision-making. Young people reported 
that they largely did as their parents told them – because livestock need herding – but that they have final control over 
the animals gifted to them by their parents.  ‘If I want to give 
them [livestock], I can give them. I can also refuse to give 
them goat. When I refuse, my family accepts my word,’  noted 
a 16-year-old girl.
There have been increasing opportunities in recent years 
for adolescents to participate in their communities. In our 
midline research, this was most evident in East Hararghe, 
where the regional youth movement known as ‘ qeerroo ’ 
helped usher Abiy to power calling for redress of Oromo 
political and socio-economic marginalisation.  While there 
is considerable debate about the role and nature of the 
qeerroo  movement (Jalata, 2016), in our research sites our 
findings revealed qeerroos  taking on some positive roles. 
For example, qeerroos  were working beside government 
officials to provide for internally displaced persons, and 
locating truant children and returning them to the classroom. 
In addition, in communities where it has been banned, they 
were also involved in collecting fines from the parents of 
adolescents caught participating in traditional shegoye  
dances (some areas have banned shegoye  given its 
negative consequences for participants’ school attendance 
and performance).  ‘The chairperson of the qeerroo  in our 
kebele  has… connections and communications with kebele  
administrators,’  explained an 18-year-old boy participant. 
‘Qeerroos  work day-in and day-out and bring children to 
school. Qeerroo  enable us to solve the serious problems that 
we have,’ emphasised a father from a remote community. 
2 The index (0–8) measures adolescents’ perception of having a say about household issues such as: how much time they spent helping 
around the house, how much education they will get, when and who they will marry, who their friends are, what they do in their free time, 
when they can leave the house and their involvement in income-generating activities, with higher scores indicating more perceived 
input into household decision makingGraphics made for GAGE by Ottavia Pasta4Although adolescents’ actions and voices are increasingly 
visible in and respected by communities in East Hararghe, 
girls remain comparatively shut out by gender norms that 
position them as subservient. A 17 -year-old girl who is a 
member of a female qeerroo  group now led by a young 
man noted that when he asked her to take over the 
group’s leadership, she declined – because she knew the 
community would never listen to her:  ‘I refused, believing 
that this village will not accept my leadership.’ 
In South Gondar (Amhara) and Zone 5 (Afar), 
adolescents’ engagement in the community tends to be 
less formal and relatively rare. In Zone 5, a 19-year-old 
divorced girl added that her generation is completely 
ignored by local leaders:  ‘Children are future leaders of 
the country, but no one seems to think that way. No one is 
concerned about the development of the area. Even in our 
high school, no one contacted us about what we need and 
what we are doing.’  A 17 -year-old boy from South Gondar 
noted that he and his friends had recently come together 
to fight desertification and climate change, after hearing 
about the issue on the radio: ‘We got the information from 
the radio, we planted a number of trees.’ Mobility, access to safe spaces and peers
Adolescents’ ability to control their movements outside 
of the home, to access safe spaces and spend time with 
friends is also highly variable. Overall – and to be expected, 
given that they are now two years older than at baseline – 
adolescents’ mobility is improving. Our midline survey found 
that 38% of young people had left their kebele  (community) 
at least once in the past three months and that fewer had 
had to seek permission to do so.  ‘I don’t ask them and I 
don’t want their permission to go everywhere,’ explained a 
15-year-old boy from Zone 5 (Afar), who noted that where 
he goes depends more on his livestock than his parents. 
In line with the broader evidence base, however, this 
was far less true for girls. Over half of boys (52%) but less 
than a quarter of girls (24%) reported having recently left 
their communities. Indeed, girls were quite likely to report 
even greater restrictions on their mobility over time, due 
to parents’ concerns about girls’ reputations and how they 
reflect family honour.  ‘Our mothers do not let us get out of 
home once we are becoming older,’  observed a 13-year-old 
girl from East Hararghe. ‘The boys are set free,’  added a girl 
of the same age from South Gondar. 
Regional differences were also marked. Adolescents 
from Zone 5 (Afar) were least likely (27%) to have left their 
communities, largely because they live in remote areas but 
also due to clan and inter-ethnic violence that has made 
travel risky. Those from East Hararghe were most likely to 
have travelled out of their kebele  (44%), due to girls’ need 
to fetch water from distant water holes and adolescents’ 
greater engagement with the cash economy and markets. 
‘There is no limit and I can go to market based on need,’ 
observed a 15-year-old girl from a remote community in 
East Hararghe.
Box 2: Marriage multiplies girls’ disadvantage across all domains
Our survey found that married girls have significantly less access to mobility, friends, and information and communications 
technology (ICT) than their unmarried peers. Compared to their unmarried peers, older married girls (17–19 years) are less likely 
to have a trusted friend (59% versus 71%), have a phone (36% versus 42%) or listen to the radio (24% versus 31%).
Our qualitative work found that the limits on married girls’ worlds are shaped by social norms around the intra-household 
gender division of labour and a husband’s control of his wife. Married girls across the regions in our study emphasised that 
they simply did not have time to engage with the world beyond their home. ‘We spend most of our time searching for firewood, 
fetching water and working on the farm, so we don’t get time,’ explained a 14-year-old married girl from East Hararghe. ‘It is those 
unmarried girls who attend school that have happiness… Married girls have a lot of household responsibilities and worries about 
their household,’ added a 15-year-old married girl from South Gondar. More important, girls agreed, was that husbands exert 
almost total control over their young wives’ lives. ‘I say that I have to wash clothes today; I have to fetch water or collect firewood. 
These things I know and I decide on my own,’ explained a married 13-year-old from South Gondar. When asked whether she 
was allowed to have a say in larger decisions, she replied: ‘It is the man who knows.’ Married girls added that while technology 
could help expand horizons even for those who are homebound, it tends to be controlled by men.  ‘Most of the time men sit and 
listen to the radio while chewing khat [a plant that acts as a stimulant, common in parts of Ethiopia] together. Females do not 
join them and listen to the radio. I never sit with them to listen to the radio,’  reported a married 15-year-old girl from Zone 5 (Afar).  Children are future leaders of 
the country, but no one seems to 
think that way ... Even in our high 
school, no one contacted us about 
what we need and what we are 
doing.
(A 19-year-old divorced girl in Zone 5 (Afar))5Younger adolescents were less likely to report having a 
trusted friend at midline than at baseline (64% compared to 
76%), presumably because they are less likely to be enrolled 
in school and – for some girls – because they are more 
likely to be married (see Box 2). There were no differences 
between unmarried girls and boys. However, those living in 
urban areas or in East Hararghe were more likely to have a 
confidant (approximately 75%) than those living in South 
Gondar (approximately 66%) and especially those living in 
pastoralist Zone 5 (Afar) (approximately 40%). The latter 
figure could be capturing the fact that due to more limited 
school enrolment in Afar, adolescents are missing out on 
opportunities to forge relationships with school peers. 
However, our qualitative findings suggest that they have 
opportunities to build friendships with age-mates: many 
Afar adolescents are active participants in sadah , a cultural 
dance where boys and girls dance outside at night without 
parental supervision. Adolescent boys also join faema , 
a tightly knit group of peers who support the elders in 
enforcing clan rules and sanctions, and commonly reported 
on the close relationships that they enjoy with their faema . 
Our qualitative work suggests that the violence unfolding 
across Ethiopia during midline data collection was often a 
formidable barrier to friendship. Younger adolescents (12–
14 years) in South Gondar reported that gun violence and 
local deaths encouraged them to limit social interactions; 
in East Hararghe, their peers remained wary following the 
border conflict of late 2017/early 2018 that left hundreds of 
thousands displaced; and in Afar, as already mentioned, 
clan and inter-ethnic tensions have disrupted community 
mobility over the past two years. Similarly, older adolescents 
in urban areas specifically detailed how friendships had been 
disrupted by inter-community violence. In Dire Dawa in late 
2019 our qualitative findings highlighted that students from 
different groups were unable to learn in mixed ethnic groups 
due to harassment and fighting, and that some parents were 
forced to withdraw their children and move them to other 
schools. For example, a 19-year-old boy from Dire Dawa reported that he changed schools mid-year ‘to isolate 
myself’ from the daily violence that took place even inside 
classrooms. A 20-year-old young woman with a physical 
disability added that she can no longer use social media 
to communicate with her friends because her phone was 
stolen in a melee at Debre Tabor University: ‘I had a mobile 
phone which is used to access Facebook but... my phone 
was stolen during the conflict in this university. I was with 
my friends in the cafeteria and when the students started 
throwing stones, I forgot my phone and left it on the table.’
Access to age-appropriate information and 
digital technology
Adolescents’ access to information and digital technology 
is also increasing, as technology filters further into rural 
areas, young people mature, and the need to be aware 
of current events has taken on new urgency as political 
events unfold and violence spreads. Although there are 
considerable differences by gender (see Box 3), residence 
location and age are the primary delimiters – a pattern 
established by our baseline research. Among older 
adolescents, 19% of those living in urban areas and 7% of 
those living in rural areas have read a newspaper at least 
once in the past month. Similarly, 61% of those in cities and 
only 33% of those in rural areas have a phone for their own 
use. (Among younger adolescents, who are less likely to 
work and to be able to contribute to the purchase price, 
figures for phone ownership are much lower – 10% and 
9% respectively.) 
Adolescents in our qualitative sample reported that 
improved access to digital technology is shaping not 
only their daily lives, allowing them to communicate with 
friends and listen to music, but also enabling them to invest 
in their futures.  ‘I used to download books,’ explained a 
17 -year-old girl from Batu, after noting that her phone had 
recently run out of charge. Somewhat surprisingly, given 
that they receive relatively little guidance from parents and 
educators, adolescents quite often also saw the downsides Box 3: The gender digital divide
Across age groups and locations, girls have significantly less access to information and digital technology than boys. This is true 
of older forms of technology, such as radio, with 37% of boys having listened at last once in the past month compared to only 
23% of girls. It is also true of newer forms of technology, with 25% of boys but only 18% of girls having a mobile phone for their 
own use. The gender gap is larger still in terms of phones with internet connectivity. In urban areas, 46% of older boys have a 
smartphone compared to 35% of girls. 
Our qualitative work highlights that gender norms prevent girls from using the digital technology that would allow them to access 
information. First parents and then husbands are afraid that girls will use phones to illicitly communicate with boys and men. ‘In 
our area, females do not have phones. It is usually males who can have a cell phone… It is to prevent women from cheating with 
other men by calling through the phone,’ explained a 14-year-old girl from Zone 5 (Afar). Even in urban areas, girls often reported 
that they must rely on word of mouth to learn what is going on around them. ‘I collect information from people,’  replied a 19-year-
old girl from Batu when asked how she learnt about current events. In rural areas, where girls’ mobility is more tightly restricted 
and their friends are just as likely to be deprived of information, many girls have no exposure to political affairs. ‘Politics is like, 
umm, it is like, umm, I don’t know what it is,’ confessed a 15-year-old girl from South Gondar. 6of improved connectivity. A 19-year-old girl from Dire 
Dawa admitted that while her phone helps her study, it also 
facilitates time-wasting: ‘There is 50% chance of anything 
to be good or bad. But our brain tends to balance towards 
the negative. Even myself, I do not use it properly. I could 
download books and read but that is not what I do.’
In an attempt to capture the dynamic changes unfolding 
across Ethiopia, our midline tools included new modules 
to explore adolescents’ political knowledge and beliefs. 
These tools highlighted that while some young people – 
primarily boys from rural East Hararghe and South Gondar 
– are embracing active citizenship, others are almost 
completely disenfranchised. In East Hararghe, 35% of older 
adolescents reported that politics were ‘very important’ 
to them. Our qualitative findings underscored that the 
ascension of Prime Minister Abiy has been personally 
salient for many young people in these communities. 
However, his administration is increasingly seen as a 
grave disappointment given a perception of limited 
gains for Oromo communities coupled with increased 
ethnic violence and insecurity. Moreover, there have 
been campaigns by political activists to resist the Prime 
Minister’s efforts to promote pan-ethnic unity. Nearly as 
many young people in South Gondar agreed that politics is  
‘very important’  (31%). ‘There is now freedom of expression 
and transparency… This is since the government changed 
and Dr Abiy came to power,’ observed an 18-year-old boy. 
By contrast, in Zone 5 (Afar), 66% of adolescents reported 
that politics were ‘completely irrelevant’  to their lives and 
in the qualitative findings only one adolescent was able to 
name the Prime Minister when asked. 
Urban adolescents, despite their increased access to 
information, were far less likely to report that politics were 
‘very important’  to them than rural adolescents. Only 20% 
of boys and 17% of girls answered in the affirmative (versus 
36% of boys and 24% of girls in rural areas). Our qualitative 
work found that for that minority, social media serves 
as a venue through which young people can discreetly 
engage in political movements. ‘Facebook users inform 
us about the political situation in the town… A person who 
uses Facebook can get access to new information like the 
violence that occurs in town,’ explained a 16-year-old boy 
from South Gondar. Similarly, a 19-year-old adolescent boy 
from Dire Dawa noted: ‘I have two Facebook pages. I use 
one of them to communicate with friends and to download 
videos. However, I use the second one to upload secret political messages and to share videos of ethnic violence 
within our community.’  The majority of urban adolescents 
reported either that they  ‘followed politics but do not really 
care’  (40% of boys and 35% of girls) or that politics were 
‘completely irrelevant’ (40% of boys and 48% of girls). Our 
qualitative work strongly suggests that urban adolescents’ 
apparent apathy is an attempt to disguise fear.  ‘I don’t need 
to talk about politics. I only want peace and stability. What 
matters is not the one who leads; it must be about peace 
and stability,’ explained a 19-year-old boy from Batu, after 
noting that gangs had led to recent chaos in the city. A 
14-year-old girl from Debre Tabor agreed, observing that 
university students have been fleeing to avoid violence: ‘It 
wasn’t that much of a problem in the past but now it is a big 
problem… These days university students are withdrawing 
because of the security issues and conflicts.’ 
Role models
In part driven by the changing world around them, young 
adolescents were far more likely to report having a role 
model at midline than at baseline (54% versus 35%). 
Improvements were more marked among boys, of whom 
63% reported an inspirational role model (compared to only 
45% of girls); and among those living in South Gondar, where 
59% had a role model (compared to 47% in East Hararghe 
and 38% in Zone 5). ‘There is no one that I consider as a role 
model,’  reported a 12-year-old girl from a remote community 
in South Gondar. Gender and regional divides were also 
apparent in the type of characteristics adolescents valued 
about their chosen role model. Girls and boys alike admired 
those who were ‘smart’ and ‘successful’,  though those from 
South Gondar tended to emphasise educational success 
and those from East Hararghe financial success.  ‘My 
sister finished her education and started a job; she brings 
blankets for my father. He blessed her so much when she 
gave him her gift. When I see her status I started to focus 
on my education to be like her,’ explained a 17-year-old boy 
from South Gondar, when asked why he wanted to be like 
his sister. Boys, however, and especially those from Zone 5 
(Afar), admired those whom they saw as ‘strong’ , while girls 
were attracted to those with a  ‘good personality’ .
The individuals that girls and boys chose as role models 
spoke volumes about girls’ relative disadvantage. While 
47% of boys who had a role model said that that role model 
was from outside the home, this was the case for only 29% 
of girls. Furthermore, while boys were likely to choose 
someone famous (24% of those with role models outside 
of the home) or a male friend or relative (43%), girls were far 
more likely to choose a male relative (40%) than a female 
friend (20%) and were very unlikely to choose someone 
famous (3%). This was also captured in our qualitative work,   Facebook users inform us about 
the political situation in the town.
(A 16-year-old boy from South Gondar)7where boys singled out political leaders for emulation while 
girls did not. ‘I want to be like Jawar [an influential political 
activist]… because he is analyst of the entire world, I want 
to achieve like that goal,’ stated a younger boy from East 
Hararghe.  ‘I want to be like PM Abiy Ahmed,’  added another, 
from the same region. Although Ethiopia’s president is 
a woman, no girl in either the quantitative or qualitative 
data spontaneously mentioned her as a role model and 
few admitted to knowing about her, even when pressed. 
‘We heard her name,’ stated a 17 -year-old girl from East 
Hararghe. Girls instead tended to mention uncles and 
older brothers and male cousins as having inspired them 
along a particular path. ‘I saw some who went to Addis 
Ababa University. My cousins were also educated… When 
I saw them learning, I said I would not be a fool,’  reported a 
19-year-old divorced girl from Zone 5 (Afar), now finishing 
secondary school after being married against her will at age 15. Indeed, even in South Gondar, where there are more girls 
who could serve as role models, girls remain likely to choose 
a man on whom to pattern their aspirations. ‘He treats us 
well and he is polite and doesn’t mistreat us,’  explained a 
15-year-old girl from South Gondar when asked why she 
chose her male English teacher as her role model.

Key actions to accelerate progress
In order to capitalise on the opportunities opening up to 
adolescents in this time of rapid political and social change 
– and yet also to keep them safe – it is vital to balance young 
people’s growing needs for independence and connection 
with their need for protection. In the case of adolescent 
girls – given their marked disadvantages as highlighted 
by our findings across the domains of voice, agency and 
mobility – it is especially important to invest in addressing 
the barriers they face at household and community levels to 
set the foundations for the realisation of SDG 5’s ambitious 
vision of equal participation of women in the political arena. 
Our research suggests the need for five broad actions 
to increase adolescents’ access to voice and agency and 
facilitate their maturation into empowered adults who 
can make decisions about their own lives and contribute 
meaningfully to their communities and country:
1  Invest in adolescent clubs and safe spaces that 
provide young people with opportunities to foster 
their own voices in child-friendly venues that over 
time segue into scaffolded community interactions: 
Provide adolescents with school- and community-
based opportunities to spend time with peers and 
with adults who can mentor them through the transition 
from childhood to adulthood. Clubs, including municipal 
youth centres, should promote programming that 
endeavours to foster confidence and voice, supports 
boys to become champions of gender equality, 
and helps young people find meaningful and age-
appropriate ways to contribute to their communities. 
2  Provide parents with parenting education courses 
that help caregivers balance adolescents’ needs 
for protection and participation:  Support parents 
to help them understand the importance of allowing 
adolescents to make age-appropriate decisions about 
their own lives and contribute to household decision-
making. Focused attention should be paid to gender 
norms, and the myriad ways they disempower girls  
and women.
3  Recognise that married girls are the most 
silenced and step up cross-community efforts to 
eliminate child marriage and support married girls’ 
agency: Work with community leaders, parents and 
adolescents to help them understand the advantages 
of adult marriage – especially vis-à-vis investments in education – and to cancel adolescent-planned 
marriages, as well as sanctioning adults who facilitate 
these unions. Simultaneously, provide programming 
for young married couples aimed at fostering more 
egalitarian forms of communication and addressing  
gender inequities.
4  Foster an engaged citizenry by ensuring that civics 
education fosters democratic and peace-oriented 
beliefs and behaviours and counters misinformation: 
Whether delivered by school curriculum and/or in 
grassroots venues, civics education for young people 
needs to focus on encouraging democratic and peace-
oriented beliefs and behaviours, including in the home, 
school and community. It is also vital to teach young 
people how to critically consume information and 
detect misinformation. 
5  Inspire girls by creating campaigns aimed at 
providing them with female role models: These 
should include regional and national-level role models, 
publicised on posters and billboards and in the school 
curriculum, given girls’ limited access to other sources 
of information. There should also be concerted efforts 
at the local level to highlight successful girls and women, 
including to girls’ families and communities.

Abstract
This article presents a study that applies integrated and multi-factor path analysis to report the direct and indirect effects of young Brazilian individual and home factors on their online opportunities and risks. The results show that engaging in more online opportunities, being older and having a lower level of parental mediation are associated with a higher number of online risks. At the same time, being older, having Internet access at home, having parents with a higher educational level, possessing more digital skills and receiving a higher level of co-use and active parental mediation are positively associated with online opportunities. Although restrictive parental mediation is negatively associated with online risks, it also reduces opportunities. In addition, co-use and active mediation are positively associated with parental educational level. These findings offer a starting point to understand children’s online behaviour and digital inclusion in Latin America and analyse its differences with other regions.

Introduction
A significant number of young people have grown up with the Internet and digital devices as part of their everyday lives (Erstad, 2012; Facer et al., 2003; Furlong and Davies, 2012; Livingstone et al., 2011; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). Researchers, policy makers and other stakeholders have focussed on the opportunities and risks that the Internet can offer to children and young people, and on the factors that may facilitate or condition them (Hasebrink et al., 2009).
The type of activities children engage in online cannot ‘be described as “beneficial” 
or “harmful”, because such judgments depend on the outcome of the activity rather than the activity itself’ (Livingstone et al., 2011: 14). However, some activities are more likely to lead to beneficial outcomes, while others will increase the likelihood of harm (Livingstone et al., 2011). The former can be conceptualised as online opportunities and the latter as online risks. Hasebrink et al. (2009) claim that although opportunities and risks are a moving target, they can be associated with certain activities: online opportuni-ties can include access to global information, educational resources, entertainment, social networking with friends, privacy for the expression of identity, content creation and civic or political participation, while online risks include illegal content or activities, sexual violence, bullying, invasions of privacy, offensive content, biased information and contacting and meeting strangers.
As Livingstone and Helsper (2010) emphasise, there is a lack of research analysing the 
multiple and integrated factors associated with young people’s Internet use considering online risks and opportunities, which are commonly studied separately. Furthermore, the focus has been placed more on online risks and safety (Smahel and Blinka, 2012) and how children cope with online risks (Vandoninck et al., 2013). Since those who encounter more opportunities also tend to face more risks online (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010), it is important to consider both aspects, especially to avoid concluding that certain factors reduce risks without accounting for their possible negative effect on opportunities.
In addition to the importance of access, frequency of use and time spent online, evi-
dence supports an association between personal factors such as age, gender, digital skills, emotional and psychological characteristics and online opportunities and risks (Helsper et al., 2013; Livingstone and Helsper, 2010; Sasson and Mesch, 2014; Smahel and Blinka, 2012). Sociocultural factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), educational resources and parental mediation of Internet use have also been found to be strongly associated with opportunities and risks (Cho et al., 2003; Hargittai, 2010; Helsper et al., 2013; Lee and Chae, 2007; Livingstone and Helsper, 2010; Robinson et al., 2003). Among these, factors such as digital skills and parental mediation of Internet use are especially relevant since they are subject to public policy intervention.
The purpose of this study is to contribute to the development of a new research approach, 
analysing multiple and integrated factors associated with young people’s Internet use Cabello-Hutt et al. 3
(Livingstone and Helsper, 2010). Considering that research in this area has developed more 
in the Northern Hemisphere (Livingstone and Bulger, 2013), this study aims to contribute to the understanding of how these phenomena arise in a Latin American country. Internet users have rapidly increased in Latin America in the past decade – on average, from 10.5% to 46.2%. In contrast, in the United States and the United Kingdom, the increase during this time was smaller but reached a significantly higher proportion of users (from 65% to 87% and from 66% to 92%, respectively; International Telecommunication Union [ITU], 2015). Despite the fast increase in access, studies in Latin America related to the impact of digital technologies in people’s everyday lives, particularly that of children, are still scarce. In this sense, Brazil, as the first country to offer international comparable data on children’s uses, opportunities and risks in the region, is an interesting case to study. Nevertheless, to further understand this phenomenon in Latin America and analyse its differences with Europe or other regions, data from more countries are necessary. This will be possible in the near future, as new Latin American countries are increasingly implementing the Kids Online survey, including Argentina in 2015–2016, Chile in 2016 and Uruguay in 2017 (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/gko/results/).
In Brazil, children face inequalities and specific features in their digital ecology, as a 
complex and multilevel phenomenon, that are closely related to opportunities and risks (Cabello et.al., 2016). Based on Brofenbrenner’s (2005) ecological model, Livingstone et al. (2015a) claim that in order to frame children’s use of digital media, it is necessary to adopt a digital ecology approach defined by at least two systemic levels. First, the level of family dynamics and personal beliefs of parents and children, and second, the level of structural factors such as income, access to technology and cultural values.
The case of Brazil
Between 2004 and 2014, Internet users (some who used the Internet in the past 3 months) 
increased in Brazil from 19% to 55% (ITU, 2015). Access and use of information and com-munication technology (ICT) are highly determined by the area where people live and their SES (Paus-Hasebrink et al., 2014). In fact, 98% and 80% of the households of two highest SES groups, respectively, have Internet access at home versus an 8% of the lowest SES group households (CGI.br, 2014). The proportion of young Internet users in Brazil is 75% among 10–15-year-olds and 77% among 16–24-year-olds. Despite this relatively high pro-portion of users, one out of four children or teens is excluded from the Internet (CGI.br, 2014; Sozio et al., 2015). The proportion who uses the Internet daily is 77% of high SES 
children, 62% of medium SES children and only 32% of low SES children (Sozio et al., 2015). Therefore, Brazil still faces an important challenge regarding the universalisation and democratisation of access and use of the Internet (Barbosa et al., 2013).
Literature review
Opportunities and risks online
Children’s Internet use has been amply studied and classified. Many of these classifica-
tions are based on children’s motivations and frequency of use and come up with 4 new media & society 00(0)
generally similar categories: entertainment, communication, information seeking and 
productivity, among others (Facer et al., 2003; Furlong and Davies, 2012; Hinostroza et.al., 2014; Ito et.al., 2008; Johnson, 2010). Nevertheless, most of these studies have limited to describe children’s uses without considering the consequences or potential consequences of the use of the Internet. Livingstone et al. (2011) propose that types of 
Internet use can be understood as online opportunities and risks. The activities that are more likely to turn into beneficial outcomes can be classified as opportunities, while those that are more likely to turn into harmful or disturbing outcomes as risks. Online opportunities can bring risks, and online risks may or may not turn into negative experi-ences or harm (Livingstone and Bulger, 2013).
There is a vast scholarship on the risks and negative experiences that children can 
encounter by using the Internet such as cyberbullying, online grooming, unwanted sex-ual material, or excessive use or Internet addiction (Aboujaoude et al., 2015; Kowalski 
et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2003; Smahel and Blinka, 2012; Whittle et al., 2012). However, research on online opportunities is scarce and more recent.
Evidence shows that older children engage in more online opportunities (Livingstone 
and Helsper, 2010) and also tend to face more risks (Livingstone and Helsper, 2008; Mitchell et al., 2003; Sasson and Mesch, 2014). Age also has an indirect effect on risks, mediated not only by access and use but also by digital skills (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010).
In general, boys tend to encounter more risks than girls (Mitchell et al., 2003; Sasson and 
Mesch, 2014), even disregarding their skill level (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010). Boys also tend to engage in more opportunities online, although gender intersects with age: as children get older, the gender gap widens in terms of diversity and amount of use (Livingstone and Helsper, 2007). The type of risks children and teenagers face online is also differentiated by gender. Livingstone et al. (2011: 6) found that boys are more exposed to sexual images online, while it is more common for girls to receive hurtful messages and also to be upset by the risks they experience. However, the evidence in being a victim of cyberbullying based on gender differences is mixed (Aboujaoude et al., 2015; Kowalski et al., 2014).
In relation to SES, there is some evidence about its association with different types of 
Internet use, specifically in terms of enhanced life chances (Robinson et al., 2003) and gratifications gained from Internet use (Cho et al., 2003). Also, the SES can be a strong predictor of the way people engage on the Internet, where those with a higher SES tend to use it in a more diverse and informed way (Hargittai, 2010). Livingstone and Helsper (2010) found that middle-class teenagers benefit more from online opportunities than working-class teenagers. However, SES did not have a direct effect on opportunities or risks but rather it was mediated by access.
Finally, parental education is also a relevant factor in explaining children’s online 
risks and opportunities. Parents with less education tend to apply more restrictive techni-cal mediation (Sonck et al., 2013), while more educated parents apply more active medi-ation (Paus-Hasebrink et al., 2012).
Digital skills
Digital skills are a set of abilities required for information society (Van Dijk and Van Deursen, 2014). They are not homogeneously distributed, generating the so-called Cabello-Hutt et al. 5
second-level digital divide (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development [OECD], 2011).
Age, gender and SES have been found to be associated with digital skills. Research 
shows that less-educated and/or lower-income people tend to have lower levels of digital skills (Aesaert and Van Braak, 2015; Correa, 2015; Hargittai, 2010; Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2010). Regarding gender, some evidence shows that girls have higher levels of digital skills (technical- and higher-order skills; Aesaert and Van Braak, 2015), and regarding age, older children tend to have higher skill levels, irrespective of access or use (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010).
Parental mediation of Internet use
Research has reported different parental mediation strategies related to media. The most commonly reported strategies include active, restrictive and co-viewing (Nathanson, 1999) as well as co-use mediation (Livingstone and Helsper, 2008; Valkenburg et al., 1999). Valkenburg et al. (2013) recently developed a validated model to evaluate the adolescents’ perceptions on restrictive and active parental mediation. They found that these perceptions are more diverse than most researchers assume. Restrictive mediation can be perceived not only as a way to control but also as a supportive mediation style. Meanwhile, active mediation can be perceived as a way to control. The authors discuss that parental mediation has not been properly analysed yet, considering the wider context of parental styles.
The European Union (EU) Kids Online framework defines and measures five types 
of parental mediation on which this study is based: (1) active or instructive mediation: talking about media content while the child is online; (2) restrictive mediation: setting rules that restrict the use of the medium; (3) co-using: remaining present while the child is online, thus sharing the experience but without commenting on the content or its effects; (4) monitoring: checking children’s online activities afterwards; and (5) restricting by technical bans or filters: using software and configurations for time con-trol and to ban or filter specific content (Dürager and Sonck, 2014). Although this classification of types of mediation differentiates between various practices, it is still limited as it does not incorporate the nuances of how these practices are taking place or being perceived by the child.
In relation to SES, research has shown that students’ online activity is shaped by their 
parents’ differential access to what Bourdieu (1986) calls economic and cultural capital and also by their different experiences with technology (Hollingworth et al., 2011). In wealthier families, parents tend to have more experience with technology and to be more digitally skilled, providing their children with more guidance and support than in less wealthy families (Vekiri, 2010: 947).
As children get older, parents reduce the frequency and diversity of the mediation 
practices (Livingstone and Helsper, 2008; Nikken and Jansz, 2014; Sonck et al., 2013; Valcke et al., 2010). Data regarding the relationship between gender and the amount or 
type of parental mediation are mixed. Some research has found that the child’s gender has no association with the overall amount of parental mediation (Livingstone and Helsper, 2008), while others have found that girls are more subject to parental mediation 6 new media & society 00(0)
than boys (Nunes De Almeida et al., 2012; Sonck et al., 2013), and others have found the 
inverse (Nikken and Jansz, 2014).
Digital skills and online risks and opportunities
Digital skills play a significant role in Internet use (Eastin and LaRose, 2000; Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Van Dijk and Van Deursen, 2014). Evidence shows that they play a direct role not only in online opportunities but also as a mediator between those oppor -
tunities and the effect of sociodemographic factors and access (Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Livingstone and Helsper, 2007, 2010).
Digital literacy is associated with both opportunities and risks encountered online 
(Livingstone and Helsper, 2010). Specifically, it is important in terms of online coping strategies when encountering upsetting situations (Vandoninck et al., 2013) and in 
whether certain uses become a harmful negative experience or an opportunity (Smahel and Blinka, 2012; Vandoninck et al., 2013).
Parental mediation and risks and opportunities online
A supportive style of mediation is associated with a safer (Fleming et al., 2006) use of the Internet and also with more positive interactive behaviour online (Lee and Chae, 2007). Norms, such as time of use or websites that children can visit, seem ineffective (Lee and Chae, 2007; Vandoninck et al., 2013). As Livingstone and Helsper (2010) show, restrict-ing Internet use with the aim of reducing risks will most likely also reduce opportunities. Similarly, ‘countries with the highest proportion of restrictive mediation practices are not systematically lower risk and harm countries’ (Helsper et al., 2013: 36).
Parental mediation and digital skills
There is a lack of evidence regarding the possible effect that any parental mediation of Internet use can have on the digital literacy level of children or teenagers. However, the EU Kids Online study shows that active monitoring and technical parental media-tion of the Internet are positively associated with digital skills, while restrictive medi-ation is negatively associated (Dürager and Livingstone, 2012; Livingstone et al., 2015b).
Hypothetical model
Most of the studies reviewed did not perform an integrated and complex analysis. For this study, we develop a multivariate approach, integrating a wider range of variables. The following questions drove this research:
RQ1. What is the association between young Internet users’ demographics (age and gender), home factors (Internet access at home, parental education, parental Internet use), parental mediation of Internet use and digital skills and the number of their online opportunities and risks?Cabello-Hutt et al. 7
RQ2. What is the association between young Internet users’ demographics, home fac-
tors, parental mediation of Internet use and their level of digital skills?
RQ3. What is the association between young Internet users’ demographics, home fac-
tors and parental mediation of their Internet use?
The literature review presented above forms the basis for the hypotheses presented in 
Figure 1. The directions of the hypothesised associations are represented by arrows: solid 
for positive, dashed for negative and dotted for unknown.
Data and method
Sample
Data for this study drew on the Kids Online Brazil project applied for the second time in 
2013 by the Regional Centre for Studies on the Development of the Information Society (Cetic.br). The sample included 2261 children and adolescents who are Internet users aged between 9 and 17 years and 2261 parents or guardians (one per child interviewed). 
Internet users were defined as people who had used the Internet at least once during the last 3 months, following the ITU (2015) definition. The survey followed a four-stage 
cluster sampling method with a probability proportional to size (PPS) selection and strat-ification of municipalities and census enumeration areas and, lastly, systematic selection of households and simple random sampling of children. Probability weights consider this selection method. For methodological details about the survey, see Cetic.br (2014).
For this study, the analytical sample consisted of 1694 Brazilian children and teenag-
ers aged 11 to 17 years. The 9–10-year-old group was not included since measures for 
digital skills were not collected for this group.Figure 1. Hypothesised model for young internet users’ online opportunities and risks.8 new media & society 00(0)

aThe data available were in age groups instead of years of age.
b These items were originally ordinal but were dichotomised in terms of non-restriction (‘can do this 
anytime’) and any type of restriction (‘can only do with permission or supervision’ and ‘can never do this’). This also allowed having the same scale for both types of mediation.
c These items are originally ordinal: ‘Many times’, ‘Sometimes’ and ‘No’, but were dichotomised (the first 
two categories were merged) in order to use the same scale for opportunities and risks.Table 1. (Continued)Cabello-Hutt et al. 11
The parental mediation measures are conceptualised and validated by Dürager and 
Sonck (2014) in a European sample. Originally these questions were intended to the dif-
ferent types of mediation separately (active, co-use and restrictive). However, an explor -
atory factor analysis using tetrachoric correlations showed the existence of two main factors (factor 1: eigenvalue = 7.52, 42% of variance explained; factor 2: eigen-
value = 4.94, 28% of variance explained) where all items of active and co-use mediation 
grouped in factor 1 and all items of restrictive mediation grouped in factor 2.
Path model estimation
A structural equation model (SEM) was fit to the data, using a path analysis model with observable endogenous and exogenous variables. Due to the non-normal distribution of some of the endogenous variables, the model was fit using the maximum likelihood method (MLM) estimator, where standard errors and chi-square tests are robust to non-normality (Rossel, 2012). This method allows for the modelling of correlated error terms, several endogenous variables and estimation of direct and indirect effects (Bollen, 1989). Recently, research on the digital divide has used the SEM methodology (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010; Van Deursen and Van Dijk, 2015), obtaining relevant results which were taken into account in the model hypothesised for this study.
The analyses were performed using the lavaan (Rossel, 2012) and lavaan.survey 
(Oberski, 2014) packages with R software (R Core Team, 2015). All analyses were con-ducted with the corresponding probability weights.
Results
The model was first fit applying all the associations presented in the hypothesised model (Figure 1), but the model fit statistics were not acceptable (χ
2[7] = 48.16, p < .001; root 
mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .059; comparative fit index [CFI] = .961; 
Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = .780). After checking the modification indices, the covari-
ance between co-use and active mediation and restrictive parental mediation was included in the estimation. This resulted in a final model with a good fit, represented in Figure 2 (χ
2[6] = 9.41, p < .152; RMSEA  = .018; CFI = .997; TLI = .979). This model has 
acceptable fit statistics, allowing for the interpretation of the coefficient estimators. A Table 2. Correlation matrix for continuous standardised variables.

third model was fit by fixing the non-significant paths to zero, and while the CFI 
improved significantly, for the other indices the non-fixed model had a better fit. Thus, the final model was adjusted without fixing the parameters. All endogenous variable variances were estimated but were omitted from the tables.
Effects on online opportunities and risks (RQ1)
The direct effects on risks and opportunities are presented in Tables 3 and 4, respec-tively. The hypothesis that online opportunities are associated with online risks is confirmed, and it is the strongest direct path to online risks. Another significant direct path to online risks is belonging to the older-age group (15 to 17 years) in comparison 
to belonging to the younger-age group (11 to 12 years). Belonging to the middle-age 
group (13 to 14 years) had no significant effect in comparison to the younger age 
group.
The hypothesis of a negative association between being a girl and online risks was not 
confirmed. However, there is an indirect path between gender and online risks, mediated by online opportunities (Table 5). In other words, the fact that girls tend to engage in less online opportunities reduces their chances of experiencing risks.
The hypotheses regarding the negative effect of both types of mediation were con-
firmed. Interestingly, the direct effect of co-use and active mediation is slightly stronger than the effect of restrictive mediation. Digital skills turned out to have a non-significant direct association with online risks; however, they did have an indirect effect mediated Figure 2. Path model for online opportunities and risks.

by online opportunities (Table 5). This means that a higher level of digital skills increases 
opportunities which may increase risks.

centage of variance explained in the model. The three strongest direct effects on online Table 3. Direct effect on online risks.

opportunities are from restrictive mediation, which has a negative effect, and from 
Internet access at home and digital skills, which both have a positive effect. Co-use and active mediation have no direct significant effect on online opportunities; however, they have a significant indirect effect when mediated by digital skills. In other words, this type of mediation may increase the level of digital skills resulting in a higher engagement with online opportunities. Belonging to either of the older age groups and a higher paren-tal education are both positively associated with opportunities. Finally, girls tend to engage in fewer online opportunities.
When looking at the total effects (sum of all direct and indirect effects on each vari-
able) presented in Table 6, we confirm the importance of the effect of online opportuni-ties, age and parental mediation on online risks. When looking at the total effects on opportunities, we confirm that restrictive mediation reduces opportunities and that Internet access at home and a higher level of digital skills increases opportunities.
Effects on digital skills (RQ2)
Age has a strong effect on digital skills, especially when comparing the older age group (15 to 17 years) with the younger group (11 to 12 years; Table 7). As hypothesised, co-use 
and active mediation are positively associated with digital skills, while restrictive media-tion is negatively associated. In addition, Internet at home and parental educational level have positive direct effects on digital skills.
Effects on parental mediation of Internet use (RQ3)
As hypothesised, parental mediation of Internet use is negatively associated with age, irrespective of the type of mediation (Table 8). However, restrictive mediation tends to be especially reduced for the older age group (15 to 17 years), with a coefficient almost three Table 6. Total effects over online opportunities and risks.

times the negative association between belonging to that group and co-use and active 
mediation. The hypothesis that being a girl is positively associated with both types of mediation was confirmed only for restrictive mediation. Having Internet access at home tends to be associated with a higher level of co-use and active mediation, while it has a non-significant effect on restrictive mediation. Again as hypothesised, parental Internet use is positively associated with both types of mediation, although it is stronger for co-use and active mediation. In addition, parental education has a significant effect on co-use and active mediation, although not on restrictive mediation. Finally, it is relevant to observe that the covariance between both types of mediation residual is significant. This could be interpreted as relating to other factors, such as parenting style, that were not measured.
Discussion and conclusion
The aim of this study was to understand the factors associated with the way children use the Internet in Brazil, considering the direct and indirect effects of sociodemographics, Internet access, parental mediation and digital skills on both online opportunities and risks.Table 7.

The results confirmed many of the previous findings from the Global North. 
Nevertheless, most of them modelled the effect of only some of the predictor variables 
included in this study. The contribution of this study is testing the persistence of these associations in a more complex model and in a Latin American country.
The result that online opportunities seem to be associated with online risks is consist-
ent with the results of Livingstone and Helsper (2010), and it strengthens the relevance of analysing them together and of revising the factors associated with them.
Our findings confirm the relevance of personal characteristics in online opportunities 
and risks – age, gender and digital skills seem to shape children’s and adolescent’s expe-riences on the Internet. As in previous studies (Livingstone and Helsper, 2008; Sasson and Mesch, 2014), older teenagers engage in more online risks than younger children, and older children engage in more opportunities (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010). Considering that younger children tend to be more receptive to parental intervention, while older children often perceive mediation as an invasion of privacy (Smahel and Wright, 2014), age should be crucial in the discussion regarding parental mediation, opportunities and risk policies.
Contrary to prior findings (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010; Sasson and Mesch, 2014; 
Vandoninck et al., 2013), gender and digital skills seem not to have a direct influence on online risks but rather operate through online opportunities. Brazilian boys are more likely to engage in opportunities online, which results in a greater likelihood of encoun-tering risks. On the contrary, the level of digital skills increases online opportunities, leading to an increase in online risks. The lack of direct relationship of digital skills with risks may be explained by the indicators used in this survey to measure digital skills, which are more focussed on managing opportunities than risks.
We also found that family factors, such as parental educational level and parental 
Internet use, are important mainly due to their influence through parental mediation. The finding that parental mediation seems to be reducing the number of risks is consistent with some previous studies (Fleming et al., 2006; Lee and Chae, 2007; Valcke et al., 
2007) and contrary to others in Europe (Helsper et al., 2013; Livingstone and Helsper, 
2008). The latter studies showed that increasing mediation did not necessarily reduce risks and also that countries with higher restrictive mediation did not have lower levels of online risk. In Brazil, both types of mediation were found to be negatively associated with the amount of online risks, although co-use and active mediation had a stronger effect compared to restrictive mediation. Co-use and active mediation do not have a direct effect on online opportunities, but as they are positively associated with the level of digital skills, they may increase the online opportunities indirectly. The fact that restrictive mediation reduces risks but also reduces opportunities questions the effective-ness of restrictive mediation on helping children and adolescents with an overall positive online experience. However, this should be further explored considering personal and/or cultural factors that have been found to affect this association (Kirwil, 2009; Lee, 2012).
Parents who use the Internet tend to practice more mediation with their children, espe-
cially co-use and active mediation. These parents may be more self-conscious about the different opportunities and risks online and tend to prefer explaining and discussing the media content and/or sharing media activities with their children rather than restricting their use.Cabello-Hutt et al. 17
Higher educated parents seem to practice more co-use and active parental mediation. 
However, parental education did not have a significant effect on restrictive mediation. 
This is consistent with European findings (Dürager and Livingstone, 2012; Livingstone et al., 2011). As Livingstone et al. (2015b) noted, highly educated parents seem to be replacing regulatory approaches with more supportive styles that encourage the child’s empowerment.
These results suggest that co-use and active parental mediation are in some way 
related to the cultural capital of the family, as defined by Bourdieu (1986). It could be hypothesised that through active or co-use mediation practices, parents are transmitting to their children a certain cultural capital in the form of advice, criteria and guidelines on 
Internet use, as proposed by Frow and Emmison (1998). Children with higher educated parents also engage in more online opportunities and have higher levels of digital skills. Thus, children from more highly educated families could be benefiting from Internet use to a greater extent than those who have fewer resources, resulting in increased inequality (De Haan, 2004). This result is particularly relevant for digital inclusion policies in Brazil and other Latin American countries, which tend to focus only on providing access and promoting Internet use. Social and especially educational policies in these countries should also work on implementing school and teacher Internet mediation strategies and on developing children’s digital skills. Otherwise, as these findings suggest, digital opportunities may potentially become a new source of inequality and could even result in the ‘amplification’ of existing social and cultural inequalities (Toyama, 2011).
In addition, we found that a structural factor, Internet access at home, was associated 
with a greater number of online opportunities. This finding, in addition to the importance of parental education, shows that the socioeconomic characteristics at home are still an important condition for online opportunities (Livingstone and Helsper, 2010). This rep-resents a relevant gap in a country like Brazil where Internet access is far from universal and there are important social inequalities. On the contrary, the importance of digital skills on online opportunities is consistent with previous findings in Europe and North America (Eastin and LaRose, 2000; Hargittai and Hinnant, 2008; Van Dijk and Van Deursen, 2014).
Finally, a general overview of the results of this model shows that as in other contexts 
of child development, access to material resources, parents’ education and mediation role, and children’s skills are all important factors in the digital context. More specifi-cally, parents who dedicate more time to active and co-use can provide more opportuni-ties for their children. These parents also tend to be more skilled and more educated, which is a very important finding facing the inequalities in Brazil and other countries in the Global South. These results support the importance of adopting an ecological per -
spective that combines personal, family, cultural and structural factors to study this phe-nomenon. At the same time, they stress the need to design overarching policies to support children’s development and well-being in the digital environment.
Some limitations of this study should be considered. First, the use of SEM posed 
some methodological challenges when using survey weights. Second, digital skills were based on a self-report rather than actual achievement, which could be reflecting other personal characteristics such as self-efficacy and social desirability, leading to an over or underestimation of the skill level. Third, the influence of teachers or peers was 18 new media & society 00(0)
not considered, which may be obscuring the way that other socialisation agents shape 
children’s experiences on the Internet. Fourth, information on technical and monitoring mediation was only available for children with Internet access at home, and therefore these types of mediation were not included in the analysis. Fifth, the mediation measures available fail to incorporate the nuances of the parenting style, possibly hiding restrictive but supportive or active but controlling types of mediation (Valkenburg et al., 2013). Future studies should also consider these extended frameworks to study parental media-tions. Finally, the definition of risks and opportunities only refers to the likelihood of harm or of benefit, respectively, and the classification of some items in each one of them could be argued. One example is the inclusion of contacting strangers online as a risk. To avoid normative approaches in these types of classifications, further qualitative and quantitative research in this area is needed.

Low-to-middle income countriesDeveloping countriesPreventionSystematic reviewInterventionABSTRACT
Background: Research on prevalence, risk factors, and prevention interventions for child sexual
abuse has continued to focus on western and developed countries. Where country-level pre-
valence data or large-scale research exists, rates of child sexual abuse are consistently higher in
developing and non-western countries than their western and developed counterparts.Objective: We systematically reviewed research on the nature of child sexual abuse interventions
in developing countries, the settings and populations included to identify types of child sexual
abuse prevention initiatives being implemented in developing countries and their eﬀ ectiveness.
Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of six databases and
identiﬁed eight studies to include in our analysis.
Results: Most empirically evaluated interventions in developing countries have focused on pre-
school and primary school-aged children. Most have focused on interventions delivered in edu-
cational settings, with a lack of focus on population-level interventions to prevent child sexual
abuse. Researchers have used outcomes measuring knowledge or skills for young people in self-
protection and help-seeking, not deployment of those skills, actual reduction in prevalence ofCSA, or improvements in conditions of safety in organizational contexts.Conclusions: If the focus on school-based strategies to prevent child sexual abuse continues in
developing countries, a signi ﬁcant gap in knowledge of the eﬃcacy of population-level inter-
ventions outside of school contexts, and consistency across the application of interventions willremain. Evaluations are needed that address the e ﬃcacy of broader government-led or whole-of-
community prevention interventions to reduce actual prevalence of child sexual abuse, or thatcan link increased knowledge and skill with reduced victimization.
1. Introduction
Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a global social problem with growing research and media attention. Many researchers in developed
countries have investigated prevalence rates ( Mathews et al., 2016 ), risk and protective factors ( Kaufman et al., 2016 ) and prevention
strategies ( Morley & Higgins, 2018) to mitigate the occurrence of CSA, particularly within the context of youth-serving organizations.
Concern regarding the signi ﬁcant issue of CSA has begun to be echoed by research in developing and non-western low-to-middle
income countries in recent years ( Abeid, Muganyizi, Massawe, Mpembeni, Darj et al., 2015 ;Al-Saif et al., 2018 ;Plummer & Njuguna,
2009; Veenema, Thornton, & Corley, 2015 ). Although some authors refer to ‘low-to-middle income countries ’, we use the term

T‘developing countries ’, based on the nomenclature set out in the UN ’s country classi ﬁcation ( United Nations, 2014 ).
The World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁ ned CSA as:
“…the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or
for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society.
Child sexual abuse is evidenced by this activity between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a
relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person. ”(World
Health Organisation, 2003, p. 75 )
It is also widely accepted that the deﬁ nition of sexual abuse includes both contact and non-contact forms of abuse ( Kloppen,
Haugland, Svedin, Maehle, & Breivik, 2016 ;Mathews & Collin-Vezina, 2017 ).
Numerous systematic reviews exist of research on topics related to CSA such as prevalence rates ( Barth, Bermetz, Heim, Trelle, &
Tonia, 2013 ;Pereda, Guilera, Forns, & Gomez-Benito, 2009; Stoltenborgh, Bakermans-Kranenburg, Alink, & van Ijzendoorn, 2015 ),
risk factors ( Putnam, 2003; Whitaker et al., 2008) and the e ﬀectiveness of di ﬀerent prevention strategies ( Letourneau, Schae ﬀer,
Bradshaw, & Feder, 2017 ;Walsh, Zwi, Woolfenden, & Shlonsky, 2018 ). These reviews, however, have largely focused on research
conducted in developed countries. Therefore, our aim here is to focus on what research evidence is available about CSA preventioneﬀorts in developing countries and identify implications for improving prevention e ﬀorts globally.
Many developing countries have begun implementing laws with local and international non-government organizations supporting
the prevention of CSA. In recent years, developing countries have broadly adopted policies and laws that directly and formally
address violence against children, including sexual abuse ( United Nations, 2014 ). This has been achieved through national plans of
action on children, the inclusion of children ’s protection from sexual violence in broad child protection initiatives, and the devel-
opment of speci ﬁc national agendas on violence against children ( United Nations, 2014 ).
In recent years, more than 20 countries have adopted di ﬀerent types of action plans for children ( United Nations, 2014 ). However,
there are varying degrees of comprehensiveness with approximately 25 % of countries surveyed by the UN not fully adopting laws to
protect children against all form of violence. Since 2006, Angola, Bolivia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Kenya, Montenegro,
Serbia, and South Sudan have adopted or amended their constitutions to include a prohibition on violence against children ( United
Nations, 2014 ). Regarding sexual violence, the United Nations (2014) noted that signi ﬁcant progress has been made in recent years
on legislation against sexual abuse and exploitation of children. Of the 104 member states of the United Nations that responded to the
UN’s Global Survey (2014) , 96 % highlighted that a prohibition on sexual exploitation of children —including prostitution —is in
place. These initiatives are promising, considering the high prevalence rates of CSA in developing countries. However, a holisticapproach to understanding the right policy mix for CSA is warranted. This systematic literature review of CSA in developing countries
is the ﬁrst
step toward more research-informed and targeted policy development.
1.1. E ﬀects of child sexual abuse
The eﬀects of CSA have been found to be both immediate and long term. In childhood, researchers have identi ﬁed eﬀects
including: cognitive impacts ( Barrera, Calderon, & Bell, 2013 ) mental health including depression, anxiety ( Olafson, 2014 ;Wurtele,
2009) and posttraumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation ( Cashmore & Shackel, 2013 ;Fergusson, Boden, & Horwood, 2008).
Long-term e ﬀects into adulthood include mental ill health ( Amado, Arce, & Herraiz, 2015 ;Fergusson et al., 2008; Lindert et al., 2014 )
as well as detrimental impact on individuals ’adult roles such as employment, parenting, education and relationships ( de Jong, Alink,
Bijleveld, Finkenauer, & Hendriks, 2015 ).
Despite the risk of child sexual abuse being lower for males than females (although not necessarily in institutions; see Quadara,
Nagy, Higgins, & Siegel, 2015 ), the e ﬀects of CSA on men have been widely researched. One reason for this, apart from the need to
understand the life-long e ﬀects of abuse for male survivors, is fears of a cycle of abuse based on the fact that the majority of adult
child sexual o ﬀenders —and adolescents with harmful or concerning sexual behaviors —are male ( Plummer & Cossins, 2018 ). These
issues may be of more concern in developing countries that have patriarchal societal norms.
CSA has vicarious e ﬀects on families and communities ( Blakemore, Herbert, Arney, & Parkinson, 2017 ), which could be ex-
acerbated in societies that emphasize the needs of group members and place importance on interconnectedness between societal
members over individual priorities due to the value placed on community engagement. Such life-long e ﬀects for male and female
victims, coupled with concerning prevalence rates globally, indicates the need to have e ﬀective interventions, policies or strategies
targeted at the prevention of child sexual abuse for both boys and girls in developed and developing countries.
1.2. Prevalence
Few countries have good prevalence data ( Mathews et al., 2016 ). Where prevalence data do exist, they are usually expressed as a
range, given the disparate deﬁ nitions, methodologies, and data reporting mechanisms employed in studies. Many researchers, as well
as international development organizations, also suggest that CSA rates are consistently underestimated due to the inherent chal-
lenges of disclosure and reporting ( Kloppen et al., 2016; Radford, Corral, Bradley, & Fisher, 2013). Recent meta-analyses have
estimated global rates of CSA to be between 7.6 –7.9 % for boys and 18.0 –19.7 % for girls ( Pereda et al., 2009 ;Stoltenborgh et al.,
2015).
Where data are available, a strong contrast exists between developed and developing countries in terms of prevalence data.
Studies from developed countries show lower prevalence rates for boys and higher for girls, compared to developing countries. ForD. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
2example, prevalence in Scandinavia is reported to be between 3 % and 23 % for boys, and between 11 % and 36 % for girls ( Kloppen
et al., 2016 ); in Japan –4.1 % for boys and 10.4 –60.7 % for girls for non-penetrative CSA ( Tanaka, Suzuki, Aoyama, Takaoka, &
MacMillan, 2017 ); and in the United States –5.1 % for boys and 26.6 % for girls ( Finkelhor, Shattuck, Turner, & Hamby, 2014 ). This
considerable international variability may be explained (at least, in part) by gender di ﬀerences in prevalence of CSA in the two key
contexts in which it occurs: organizational vs. familial abuse. As Quadara et al. (2015) noted:
‘Child sexual abuse occurring within institutional settings (including residential, care, education, sporting or religious organi-
zations) generally see higher rates of boys being victims of abuse than girls; however, girls are victims of teacher-student sexual
abuse at a higher rate than boys ( Knoll, 2010; Moulden, Firestone, Kingston, & Wexler, 2010 ;Sullivan & Beech, 2004). Generally,
sexual abuse committed by educators occurs at a similar rate globally. ’(p. 8)
In recognition of the negative e ﬀects of segregated, institutional care and the bene ﬁts of family-based care, progressive de-
institutionalization of many care environments in western countries has occurred, such as home-based services to replace psychiatric
institutions and segregated homes for children and adults with disability and mental illness (e.g., see: Torrey, 1997 ) and the de-
velopment of foster care and kinship care in the child protection system to replace children ’s orphanages ( Innocenti Research Centre,
2003). Given such institutional care for children has been associated with high levels of neglectful and abusive behaviour - including
child sexual abuse, this might then lead to a di ﬀerent gender mix in overall prevalence of CSA in developed compared to developing
countries.
Based on the limited research that does exist, prevalence rates in developing countries paint a poorer picture than is the case for
developed/western countries. For example, Croatia has an overall prevalence of 10.8 % ( Ajdukovi ć,S u šac, & Rajter, 2013 ). Rates are
even higher for countries in Asia, Africa and South America, with rates of 14 % in Saudi Arabia ( Al-Eissa et al., 2015 ), between 16.4 %
(Zolotor et al., 2009 ) and 53.2 % ( Kacker, Varadan, & Kumar, 2007) in India, 27 % in Colombia, 30.6 % in Russia ( Zolotor et al.,
2009), and 13 % for boys and 28 % for girls in Tanzania ( Abeid, Muganyizi, Mpembeni, Darj, & Axemo, 2015 ). In some cases, these
rates may be comparable to data from developed countries, however data from developing countries are often not able to be dis-aggregated by gender. In other cases, there is distinct and concerningly higher rates in many developing and non-western low-to-
middle income countries, which has led to investigations of not only shared risk factors globally, but also speci ﬁc cultural and
contextual risk factors in these localities.
1.3. Risk factors
Although much of the research on risk factors has occurred in developed western countries, similar factors have been identi ﬁed
across a range of developing countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan and many African countries ( Ali, Ali, Khuwaja, & Nanji, 2014;
Bridgewater, 2016; Meinck, Cluver, Boyes, & Mhlongo, 2015; Rumble et al., 2018). In addition to the general risk factors associated
with CSA (see Kaufman et al., 2016 ;Putnam, 2003 ), developing countries face speci ﬁc risk factors due to their context. These
contextual di ﬀerences
are associated with the strong community-centric thinking of many societies in developing countries ( Meinck,
Cluver, Boyes, & Loening-Voysey, 2016 ;Plummer & Njuguna, 2009), and the economic situations faced by individuals, families and
communities ( World Health Organization, 2010 ). Research suggests these contextual risk factors play a more signi ﬁcant role in the
risk of CSA occurring than the individual or family-level factors prominent in both developed and developing countries ( Plummer &
Njuguna, 2009). These contextual risks include the patriarchal nature within communities ( Whitehead & Ro ﬀee, 2016 ), stereotyped
and discriminatory gender norms ( Bridgewater, 2016 ), and the perceived role of children within tribal communities ( Plummer &
Njuguna, 2009 ). Exacerbation of risk factors as a result of the absence of governance processes, the absence of screening mechanisms
to identify those who have already o ﬀended against children, and poor adult-child supervision ratios ( Royal Commission into
Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, 2017 ) provide additional credence to the higher prevalence rates in developing
countries.
1.4. Prevention
A recent shift in how to address the issue of child sexual abuse has seen an increase in the desire to prevent abuse before it occurs,
rather than focus on better responses once CSA has already occurred, in order to reduce the likelihood of harm and ongoing trauma
(Letourneau et al., 2017; Levine & Dandamudi, 2016 ). This shift has required an investigation into how those outside of law en-
forcement (responsible for responding after CSA has occurred), can play a role in preventing abuse from occurring in the ﬁrst place.
CSA has been widely cited as a public health problem ( Letourneau, Brown, Fang, Hassan, & Mercy, 2018 ;Mathews, 2017).
Numerous researchers have suggested that population-level prevention initiatives (i.e., a public health approach) are the best way toprevent CSA, including researchers from both English-speaking western countries ( Letourneau, Eaton, Bass, Berlin, & Moore, 2014;
McMahon & Puett, 1999), and developing countries ( Skeen & Tomlinson, 2013 ;Veenema et al., 2015). Public health approaches
recognize that prevention occurs at three levels: Primary (before it occurs); secondary (when risks are evident); and tertiary (after
harm has occurred, to ameliorate its impact and prevent future harm) ( Quadara et al., 2015 ). Due to the community- and macro-level
approaches utilised in public health approach models, it is often led at the governmental or national level ( Herrenkohl, Lonne, Scott,
& Higgins, 2019). However, WHO (2015) noted that no national plans to prevent CSA existed across South East Asian countries,
raising questions as to whether any population-level initiatives were being applied in developing countries.
The ‘target ’of primary CSA prevention activity can range from individuals through to whole-of- community interventions.
Interventions such as delivery of CSA prevention education (or protective behaviors programs ( Quadara et al., 2015) are focused onD. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
3the individual knowledge and skill of children and young people: to understand their bodies, their right to safety and how to seek help
if confronted with concerning or abusive behaviour at the earliest possible opportunity. On the other hand, community-level pre-
vention initiatives such as parent-education strategies are typically large-scale government-led initiatives reaching much larger
audiences. To complement the focus on the knowledge, attitudes and skills of individuals, more recently, there has been a stronger
focus on situational and cultural risk factors in youth-serving organizations and other community settings ( Kaufman, Erooga, Higgins,
& Zatkin, 2019 ;Morley & Higgins, 2018 ).
Prevention initiatives need to be comprehensive, considering not only the broad range of risk factors, but also the potential
sources of protective strategies. Although there is good evidence for the e ﬀectiveness of prevention strategies to address other forms
of familial child maltreatment (such as home-visiting during the prenatal/infancy period –seeHolzer, Higgins, Brom ﬁeld,
Richardson, & Higgins, 2006), there is no available evidence to show that such generic family support initiatives are e ﬀective at
preventing CSA. Prevention initiatives also need to be targeted to the unique risks for CSA. As well as strategies to increase skills,
awareness and obligations of individual children/young people and their parents/caregivers, safety concerns also need to be ad-
dressed at a macro-societal level. These strategies should be focused on (a) equipping large numbers of young people with skills to
resist thus increasing the e ﬀort required of o ﬀenders to engage in o ﬀending behavior; (b) training adult workers who work in youth-
serving organizations to better understand the risk factors and signs and how to implement situational risk mitigation to addressprevent or interrupt grooming behaviour; and (c) increasing obligations surrounding reporting of child sexual abuse and those who
engage in potentially grooming behavior (e.g., see: https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/health/childprotection/
Pages/expolitationgrooming.aspx ).
Systematic reviews of prevention methods in western and developed countries, such as that by Walsh et al. (2018) , have con-
tinued to support the development of programs and strategies to prevent child sexual abuse within these countries. Training programssuch as the Child Abuse School Liaison program ( Hanson et al., 2008 ) and the Enough! Preventing Child Sexual Abuse in My School online
training program ( Gushwa, Bernier, & Robinson, 2018 ) have shown positive results in improving knowledge and skills related to
preventing child sexual abuse. Whether such improvements in knowledge lead to reduction in actual occurrence of child sexual abuse
is debated in the literature ( Walsh et al., 2018 ). With the identi ﬁcation of speci ﬁc contextual risk factors in developing countries,
some researchers have begun looking at the e ﬀectiveness of prevention methods at the individual country level in developing and
non-western countries. We are not aware of any existing review of evaluations of CSA prevention strategies being applied in de-
veloping countries. However, knowledge of what prevention strategies are available —and their e ﬀectiveness in preventing CSA —is
needed to support the work of researchers, practitioners and policy makers wanting to improve the safety and wellbeing of childrenand young people globally.
Many western countries have had formal inquiries and government reviews, and in response, many prevention activities have
been implemented (through regulation by government, as well as voluntarily by organizations) and the nature of youth-serving
organizations having changed radically through a major process of de-institutionalization of disability and child welfare services
(Innocenti Research Centre, 2003; Torrey, 1997 ). It is important now to see what the application of these lessons might be for
developing countries where there may not have been government-led review of system failures, and where a greater proportion of the
population of children are spending time in institutional care of the kind subject to these inquiries.
Our aim is to systematically review the available evidence on the e ﬀectiveness of CSA prevention strategies in developing
countries. The research question that guided the analysis is: What type of sexual abuse prevention interventions or initiatives are
being implemented in developing countries, and are they e ﬀective?
In conducting this review, our aim is to better understand the types of prevention strategies that e ﬀectively support individuals,
organizations and communities in these countries. We hope to highlight best practice, knowledge gaps, and implementation gaps
(where we may have good evidence of e ﬀectiveness, but limited take-up of interventions) in relation to prevention of CSA, and to
identify implications for how best to support the safety of children and young people in developing countries from sexual abuse.
2. Method
To guide the systematic review, we developed an internal protocol, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria ( Moher et al., 2015 ). (Available by emailing the corresponding author.)

4literature. The databases searched included: Scopus, Web of Science (Core Collection), PsycINFO, ERIC, MEDLINE and the Social
Sciences Index. No date restrictions were used in order to capture as many studies as possible within the search parameters. Table 1
outlines the terms we included in our keyword searches. Where possible, we also conducted subject heading (index) searches.
2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Articles were included if they: (1) included an intervention, program, training or educational strategy to support the prevention of
sexual abuse or assault; (2) investigated the e ﬃcacy of the intervention by measuring changes in (a) knowledge, (b) attitude, (c)
perceptions, or (d) safeguarding practices, or the number of child sexual abuse reports made; (3) measured the outcome relevant to
(a) children and young people and/or (b) sta ﬀor volunteers working with young people; and (4) were conducted in a developing
country, as deﬁ ned by the International Statistical Institute (n.d.) . Our search strategy focused on English-language databases and
publications –although we did screen articles in Spanish, in which one co-author was ﬂuent.
Articles were excluded if they simply discussed the prevalence of child sexual abuse, investigated risk or protective factors related
to child sexual abuse within a speci ﬁc context (but with no reference to an intervention or prevention strategy), or if the prevention
strategy or intervention was aimed at child maltreatment in general and did not have elements speciﬁ c to sexual abuse. The search
strategy did not speci ﬁcally target grey literature.
2.3. Study selection
SeeFig. 1 for an overview of the search process. Initial searching resulted in 2,639 articles, of which 974 were duplicates. Authors
1 and 3 double-blind screened the remaining 1,665 articles using Rayyan QCRI Ouzzani, Hammady, Fedorowicz, & Elmagarmid,
2016), with any disagreement referred to Author 2 for a ﬁnal decision. This process resulted in 20 articles included for data ex-
traction. Of the 20 full-text papers retrieved for data extraction, two were pilot or introductory papers leading to the retrieval of 6additional papers through searching for additional papers or contacting the corresponding author. Of these 26 papers, ﬁve were
included in the ﬁnal data analysis after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Two additional papers were found while searching for material for the introduction to this review, and a third paper was sug-
gested by an anonymous reviewer upon submission of the manuscript for publication. Since these papers met the inclusion criteria,they were included. The ﬁnal analysis included eight studies.
2.4. Analysis plan
In analyzing the eight studies included in this review, as well as considering the results of each study, we focused on the
methodology and design, study characteristics (including year and size of study), sample population (age, gender etc.), and the
country of research. Data were extracted using an Excel spreadsheet based on the Cochrane Public Health Group Data Extraction and
Assessment Template. Using these data, indirect comparisons —where interventions used in separate studies are compared —were
made, to identify what types of interventions/initiatives/strategies are being used in developing countries to prevent CSA and howeﬀective these interventions are when considering the outcomes measured in each individual study.
3. Findings
3.1. Overview of studies
Two studies were from Africa, ﬁve were from Asia and one from Latin America. All the studies reviewed used a quantitative
methodology using quasi-experimental or experimental designs. Three studies were large-scale (over 500 participants), whereas the
remaining six were small-scale studies. Only one study ( Citak Tunc et al., 2018) made reference to any funding provided for the
research, which was provided by a university scienti ﬁc research projects management unit. This is not to say the other research, or
indeed interventions weren ’t provided funding, but this was not explicitly stated within the research articles. All but one study
included both male and female participants. Across the studies, interventions were implemented by a range of people including;teachers, nurses, trained facilitators, and children/young people themselves. We now describe which group(s) of participants were
the focus of attention within the studies, the types of interventions, and whether they were focused on evaluating e ﬃcacy of those
interventions.
3.2. Participants
As can be seen in Table 2, most research on interventions to support the prevention of child sexual abuse in developing countries
has been focused on younger children: either in primary school ( Dunn, 2011 ;Fitriana, Suryawati, & Zubaidah, 2018; Hurtado, Katz,
Ciro, Guttfreund, & Nosike, 2014; Neherta, Machmud, Damayanti, & Afrizal, 2017 )
 or pre-school ( Citak Tunc et al., 2018; Zhang
et al., 2014). One study focused on increasing the sexual abuse prevention knowledge of children living with a disability ( Kucuk,
Platin, & Erdem, 2017). One evaluated a program that supported women and children at risk of sexual abuse ( Sinclair et al., 2013 ).D. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
53.3. Types of interventions
Most of the interventions used within the studies included in this review focused on improving children ’s knowledge of what
constitutes appropriate and inappropriate touching and self-e ﬃcacy to act (i.e., to speak up and seek help) if —hypothetically —they
were exposed to an abusive behaviour. Many of these educational interventions included the use of story books and other devel-
opmentally appropriate materials. One study focused on improving self-defense capabilities in young people, and three utilized one of
two intervention programs developed overseas (in western countries).
Within the literature included in this review, there was evidence of only one investigation into the e ﬃcacy of a large-scale,
government-led intervention to prevent CSA in a developing country ( Dunn, 2011). Similarly, there was little evidence of inter-
ventions that went beyond just increasing knowledge and/or skills of children and young people regarding how to stay safe from
potential abuse. Such studies have been questioned in relation to whether they contribute to a decrease in actual CSA victimization,
not just an increase in knowledge or skills ( Walsh et al., 2018 ). What was evident through this review was the e ﬀorts by researchers to
use strong methodologies such as experimental and pre-post intervention measurement designs, to a focus on measurement of

3.4. Outcome measures
Of the eight studies reviewed, four used psychometrically sound outcome measures. These measures included the “What if ”
Situations Test ( Wurtele, Hughes, & Owens, 1998 ), the Personal Safety Questionnaire ( Wurtele, Gillispie, Currier, Franklin, & Neglect,
1992) and the Children ’s Knowledge of Abuse Questionnaire-Revised ( Tutty, 1995). Sinclair et al. (2013) was the only study we
identiﬁed that used incidence rates in both an intervention and control group to measure the reduction in sexual abuse as a result of
the intervention being tested, while the remaining studies used their own outcome measure developed for the study, with no re-
porting on reliability or validity of the measure.
4. Discussion
The aim of this systematic review was to understand the state of primary prevention strategies being used and evaluated in
developing countries. We identify the nature of child sexual abuse prevention strategies and interventions in developing countries,
understand the typical settings and population groups in which intervention strategies are being used, to investigate the e ﬀectiveness
of the interventions used.
4.1. Nature of prevention policies and interventions
In the few interventions outlined in the research papers included in this review, most prevention work is targeted at the local
level, typically in education settings for children at pre-school and primary school. These interventions focused on improving chil-
dren’s understanding of their bodies, appropriate and inappropriate touch, and who they could reach out to if they have concerns
about someone ’s behavior. Given the reach of school systems, these interventions could be classi ﬁed as being based on a public health
approach to primary prevention ( Herrenkohl et al., 2019). Numerous researchers ( Letourneau et al., 2014 ;Quadara et al., 2015) have
discussed the importance of utilizing a public health approach to prevent child sexual abuse. As it involves both policy setting andcommunity-wide activities (such as awareness raising and behavior change strategies), public health strategies are typically led at the
national or state government level. Of the studies included in this review, only one study was a government-led intervention ( Dunn,
2011).
Two studies ( Citak Tunc et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014 ) focused on an intervention —the Body Safety Training Pro-
gram —developed in the US in the mid-1980s, and revised in 2007, and which has been tested for e ﬃcacy when compared to control
groups and other intervention options (see: ( Wurtele, Saslawsky, Miller, Marrs, & Britcher, 1986 ;Wurtele, Kast, Miller-Perrin, &
Kondrick, 1989). Both studies discussed the translation of the program into the respective language of the participants —Mandarin
and Turkish —using psychologists, educators and other experts to support the translation of either the entire program or the key titles.
The use of ‘western ’interventions in developing countries comes with advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, these pro-
grams have often been evaluated in experimental trials and been found to enhance knowledge about sexual abuse and protective
skills. On the other hand, it is yet to be investigated whether sexual abuse prevention programs developed and shown to be e ﬃcacious
in one cultural or social context can be as e ﬀective in a di ﬀerent cultural or social context.
Considering the use of Body Safe Training Program —a western-developed, local-level intervention —in these two studies, it is
reasonable to consider that an expansion of interventions in developing countries could include western-developed community andsocietal-level interventions. Already there has been e ﬀorts to introduce child maltreatment prevention strategies from western-
developed countries such as parent education and early home visiting; however these were not identi ﬁed
through our literature
search (because they are broader in their goals and not designed to speci ﬁcally to prevent CSA, and no data exist to demonstrate their
eﬃcacy at reducing the risk of CSA). These kinds of societal and community-level interventions would most likely be based on
government-led prevention policies in developed countries but would have to take into consideration the cultural factors relevant to
the context in which interventions were being implemented.
4.2. Typical settings and population groups
Although the eight studies re ﬂected a variety of intervention types, speci ﬁc information was not always available. Where it was,
school-based interventions or interventions delivered by teachers were the most common. This trend has been previously noted
within the wider literature ( Letourneau et al., 2014 ). Evidence of the e ﬀectiveness of school-based interventions aimed at preventing
CSA—largely in developed countries —has been identi ﬁed through a recent systematic review ( Walsh et al., 2018 ). However, Walsh
et al. questioned whether children ’s gains in knowledge and skills translates to an actual reduction in CSA. This has implications for
developing countries where not all children are in school. The out-of-school rate in primary school-aged children in low-incomecountries is 20 % relative to 3 % in their high-income counterparts; the lower secondary out-of-school rate is 38 % and 2 %,
respectively. Of children not attending school globally, approximately 84 % are from developing countries ( UNESCO, 2018). Vul-
nerable groups, such as poor girls, are more likely to be out of school ( Mertaugh, Jimenez, & Patrinos, 2009). Thus, there is agreement
that a public health model, including population-level prevention strategies and a situational prevention approach, would be better
placed to improve prevention of child sexual abuse across di ﬀerent settings ( Kaufman, Erooga, Higgins, & Zatkin, 2019 ;Quadara,
2019). However, we did not identify any population-level interventions within the search parameters of this review. With so fewD. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
9studies meeting the criteria we set, concern regarding the e ﬀectiveness of programs to reduce the high rates of CSA in developing
countries is warranted.
Most interventions in developing countries appear to focus on very young children. The development —and empirical in-
vestigation —of interventions aimed at pre-school aged children is warranted considering the research showing that children under
the age of seven constitute a signi ﬁcant proportion of CSA victims ( Finkelhor, 1984). The intervention most used in developing
countries for children this age identi ﬁed in our review is the Body Safety Training program ( Wurtele et al., 1986 ), evaluated by two of
the papers ( Citak Tunc et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014 ).
We were not able to uncover any peer-reviewed evaluation work conducted by any NGO in this review. Despite many interna-
tional aid and development agencies recognizing the importance of child protection in their work, it was surprising to see no
published evaluations of the e ﬃcacy of such programs. This could be because assessing outcomes (as opposed to delivering in-
itiatives) is not as highly valued, the di ﬃculties in translating evaluation results for peer-review publication, or the general challenges
of outcome evaluation designs makes such an activity very di ﬃcult.
4.3. Intervention eﬃ cacy in developing countries
Overall, the studies provided a positive picture about the e ﬀectiveness of the interventions in increasing abuse prevention
knowledge and —when tested —the self-e ﬃcacy of children and young people to take protective action should they encounter an
unsafe situation. All six studies that measured knowledge and/or skills showed signiﬁ cant improvements in participants ’capabilities.
The evidence suggests that interventions that aim to improve young people ’s knowledge and/or skills regarding keeping themselves
safe can be successful in that goal; however, researchers have not gone further to measure whether that increased knowledge and/orskill in the longer term leads to a decrease in sexual abuse victimization as a result. Such evidence would be di ﬃcult to obtain without
strong existing country or regional prevalence data, or at least incidence data for CSA reported to authorities, against which tocompare. Considering the average delay between abuse and disclosure of CSA is estimated to be in the order of 20 years ( Royal
Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, 2017 ), this is a signi ﬁcant barrier to comprehensive evaluation of
current prevention e ﬀorts. The studies included in our review give evidence that a range of individuals —both professional and
peers —can support the improvement of sexual abuse prevention knowledge in young people. As prevalence and incidence are
notoriously di ﬃcult to measure in relation to child sexual abuse ( Mathews et al., 2016), it is perhaps not surprising that only one
study within the scope of this review used incidence rates to measure success ( Sinclair et al., 2013 ). Incidentally, in that study, rates
of sexual abuse dropped signi ﬁcantly as a result of the intervention. In the 10 months following participation in the program, sexual
assault incidence rates showed a statistically signi ﬁcant reduction within the intervention group of 15.4 %. The control group saw no
change in incidence rates across the same time. Verbal defense skills were identi ﬁed as the ﬁrst skill learned, followed by physical
self-defense skills. The authors attributed the decline in incidence for the intervention group to this. They acknowledged that if CSA
did occur, the intervention group would also be more likely to disclose that assault had occurred, noting that this opened the door to
potential support and intervention ( Sinclair et al., 2013 ).
The results from developing countries con ﬁrm
what has also been shown in developed countries: that prevention strategies
focused on knowledge can e ﬀectively increase the sexual safety knowledge and skills of young children. However, there is a lack of
evidence that supports the link between an increase in knowledge and a decrease in incidence of CSA ( Walsh et al., 2018 ). This lack of
evidence is not because of a lack of data to show no relationship, but because of the absence of an agreed ‘proxy outcome ’measure
and the di ﬃculty in tracking actual incidence of CSA, particularly in the absence of national prevalence or representative surveillance
data on sexual abuse incidence in most countries. The challenge of attributing direct outcomes to prevention-oriented policies and
interventions apply equally in developed and developing countries ( Mathews et al., 2016 ).
Seven of the eight studies focused on acquisition of knowledge and/or skills as the primary outcome measure. Only one evaluation
(Sinclair et al., 2013 ) looked at the implementation of that knowledge, the con ﬁdence and self-e ﬃcacy of participants to take action
based on knowledge/skill, or other emotional factors that might inﬂ uence implementation of the knowledge gained. Few studies
followed-up with participants. One study ( Dunn, 2011) that measured knowledge gains conducted follow-up tests after six weeks. The
study that measured disclosures of child sexual abuse and rape ( Sinclair et al., 2013) collected post-intervention data after 10 months.
Other than these follow-up procedures, there were no follow-up studies that examined the retention of knowledge, use of skills or
changes in con ﬁdence over time.
4.4. State of knowledge of CSA primary prevention activities in developing countries
The number of experimental or quasi-experimental designs is a major strength of the approach being taken by researchers in
developing countries to evaluate the e ﬀectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing CSA. Most of the studies had random allo-
cation to intervention and control groups, with some utilizing a pre-post evaluation design, measuring the intended outcomes bothbefore and after intervention. One of the key weaknesses of the research we identi ﬁed is the lack of comparative analysis of two or
more programs, using the same implementation protocol and outcomes evaluation strategy. Currently, no data exist to suggest whatworks better. All that can be said, given the range of speci ﬁc intervention programs, is that prevention knowledge and skills canbe
taught and achieve statistically signi ﬁcant increases in children ’s knowledge of sexual abuse prevention concepts in developing
country contexts, as has been seen in western English-speaking research on school-based interventions. A second key weakness is the
lack of outcome variables measured in research investigating CSA prevention strategies. Most research regarding the e ﬃcacy of
interventions has focused on the increase of children ’s prevention knowledge and skills. Investigation into the conditions of safetyD. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
10that support a situational crime prevention approach to preventing child sexual abuse could be gained by measuring additional
variables such as children ’s perceptions of safety within settings where abuse can potentially occur ( Moore, McArthur, Heerde, Roche,
&O’Leary, 2016 ), the safeguarding capabilities of sta ﬀand volunteers working with children and young people ( Russell & Higgins,
2019, 2020 ), or parent, carer, and family empowerment and awareness of CSA prevention being used in organizations and within the
community.
5. Conclusion
Safeguarding children from CSA has continued to receive increasing attention globally due to high incidence and prevalence rates.
While developed countries such as the US, Australia and countries across Europe have 40 years ’experience researching and de-
veloping interventions to prevent CSA, developing countries have only seen empirical evaluation of the e ﬀectiveness of such in-
terventions in the past decade. Although data are limited, as developing countries appear to have higher prevalence of CSA compared
to developed and western countries, it is heartening to see that school-based prevention interventions can result in increased
knowledge and skills for children in these countries. Despite the importance assigned to safeguarding activities by international aid
organizations, however, there is scant evidence in English language peer-review journals of rigorous quality evaluations of the
policies and related intervention strategies they can —or do —employ when working in developing countries.
Although there are considerable e ﬀorts internationally to prevent CSA that exist, however, they have not been subject to empirical
evaluation and the ﬁndings published in peer-review journals. The sizeable gap between the prevention e ﬀorts, and the formal
research evaluating their e ﬀectiveness suggests an area of focus for funding and further research e ﬀorts to understand whether and
how such prevention initiatives are (or are not) e ﬀective in their goal of preventing CSA in developing and non-western low-to-
middle income countries.
Considering the global scale and growing interest in addressing the problem of CSA, it is disappointing to have not found more
evidence of large-scale government-led initiatives to combat this abuse in developing countries. Compared to developed nations, fewevaluations of government-led initiatives, or institutional standard practices such as curriculum, have been undertaken in developing
countries. It is a given that individual nations hope to make a di ﬀerence and reduce CSA, but further work —and the requisite
funding —is needed to apply a rigorous public health approach with an evaluation component. Most programs being evaluated in
developing countries were isolated interventions or programs. Although there are some limited local, school-level programs in de-
veloping countries, even in that context, we did not ﬁnd reference to there being an overarching public health or system-level model
behind the interventions on which teaching about prevention of sexual abuse can be based at a whole-of-population level. We foundno evaluation of a national or regional initiative, or of an integrated prevention framework in a developing country.
There was relatively poor geographical coverage of evaluative research regarding CSA prevention, with no international com-
parisons undertaken. No evaluations were published from South America; North Africa, Paci ﬁca, or the Middle East. Given our
systematic search of multidisciplinary databases found so few eligible studies, research into CSA prevention in developing countries
and evaluation of interventions is a global need. For prevention strategies to e ﬀectively support individuals, organizations and
communities in developing countries, more rigorous evaluations need to be conducted and reported, so that the internationalcommunity can identify best practice for implementation.
6. Implications
To support local-level activities in developing countries aimed at reducing CSA, the accessibility of primary prevention programs
should be a focus of governments and non-government organizations operating in developing countries (who are funded directly by
governments, international aid agencies, and overseas donors). Country-wide policies/programs are needed, supported by partner-
ships with research experts to conduct evaluation research on their prevention e ﬀorts–whether they be at community or societal
levels. As is the case in dealing with related areas of interpersonal violence, such partnership activities between international agenciesand governments must also recognize and promote equality and the human rights of women and children, which underpin many of
the intervention activities.
CSA-speci ﬁc prevention also needs to be situated within the context of child maltreatment prevention more broadly, from a public
health perspective ( Herrenkohl et al., 2019). By recognizing the crossover between CSA prevention and broader child maltreatment
prevention, as well as issues related to gender and patriarchal social norms, prevention initiatives would be able to relate speciﬁ cally
to the risk factors identi ﬁed as being more relevant in the developing nations in which they are being implemented.
This
review highlights the need for prevention programs that are broader and go beyond school-based sexual abuse prevention
knowledge of children (particularly given the higher out-of-school rates in developing countries), linked to a framework for com-
prehensive CSA prevention, and preferably an even broader child maltreatment prevention framework.
Considering the opportunities a ﬀorded through technological solutions (where these can be appropriately used), research is
needed to investigate the e ﬃcacy of how these can be applied in developing countries, with consideration to the limitations and risks
that come with internet access in relation to CSA, could support broader roll-out of e ﬀective prevention interventions.
With the use of western-led interventions in developing countries to reduce CSA, it is essential to consider cultural adaptation of
such interventions, based on a solid examination of cultural beliefs that may be barriers or enablers of prevention e ﬀorts. As well as
development of new culturally appropriate and speci ﬁc CSA prevention strategies, such adaptations would need to ensure con-
sideration of the perceived role of children and young people within the societies that interventions are being applied in, as well asthe level of importance placed on community and societal cohesion.D. Russell, et al. Child Abuse & Neglect 102 (2020) 104395
11The primary prevention programs that governments and non-government agencies begin utilizing should go beyond school-based
protective behaviors programs, measuring only the increase in knowledge and skills, but rather be linked to a broader framework for
comprehensive prevention that includes improving conditions of safety for children, such as addressing workforce capabilities and
building engagement with parents and the broader community. Those leading prevention e ﬀorts should include within their pro-
grams research —including qualitative methodologies —to evaluate the e ﬀectiveness of prevention e ﬀorts in speci ﬁc contexts. For
example, this could include programs delivered in contexts where children may not be attending school regularly, and where other
risks to their safety and wellbeing (from poverty, neglect, child labor, etc.) may intersect with their risk of CSA and the capacity of
prevention initiatives to be e ﬀective.

Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse among Primary School Children in Langata Sub-county, Nairobi City County in Kenya   Wilkins Ndege Muhingi Pan Africa Christian University  Johnson Nzau Mavole St. Augustine University of Tanzania  Mumo Nzau University of Nairobi      Abstract Kenya introduced Digischool to public primary schools to prepare children for today¶s digital world attracting a cyber-threat landscape. Utilising a descriptive cross-sectional design within a concurrent mixed approach, the study examined the relationship between digital literacy intervention and online child abuse among primary school children in Langata sub-county. Targeted, were children between 9 and 17 years from private and public primary schools, teachers, parents and policy makers, and child protection officers. Godden¶s formula informed purposive and random sampling of 384 respondents, plus a 10% (423) respondents for Key Informant interviews and focused discussions. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics and content analysis with the help of SPSS version 22 and Nvivo version 12 respectively. The study revealed stakeholders intervened in online child abuse at various levels using several strategies.  The study revealed a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure online. Since the p-value (0.000) was less than alpha (0.05) and we conclude there was a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure to online child abuse.  There is a need for systems thinking and a concerted multi-sectoral approach to the improvement of digital literacy hence protecting children online.

Educación Alfabetización Digital y Abuso Infantil Online entre Alumnado de Primaria en Langata Sub-county, Nairobi County en Kenya Wilkins Ndege Muhingi Pan Africa Christian University  Johnson Nzau Mavole St. Augustine University of Tanzania Mumo Nzau University of Nairobi     Resumen Kenia introdujo Digischool en las escuelas primarias públicas para preparar a los niños para el mundo digital actual que atrae un panorama de amenazas cibernéticas. Utilizando un diseño transversal descriptivo dentro de un enfoque mixto concurrente, el estudio examinó la relación entre la intervención de alfabetización digital y el abuso infantil en línea entre los niños de la escuela primaria en el subcondado de Langata. Los beneficiarios fueron niños de entre 9 y 17 años de escuelas primarias públicas y privadas, maestros, padres y encargados de la formulación de políticas, y oficiales de protección infantil. La fórmula de Godden informó un muestreo intencionado y aleatorio de 384 encuestados, más un 10% (423) encuestados para entrevistas con informantes clave y discusiones enfocadas. Los datos cuantitativos y cualitativos se analizaron utilizando estadísticas descriptivas e inferenciales y análisis de contenido con la ayuda de SPSS versión 22 y Nvivo versión 12 respectivamente. El estudio reveló que las partes interesadas intervinieron en el abuso infantil en línea en varios niveles utilizando varias estrategias. El estudio reveló una relación significativa entre el tipo de escuela y la exposición en línea. Dado que el valor p (0,000) fue menor que alfa (0,05) y concluimos que hubo una relación significativa entre el tipo de escuela y la exposición al abuso infantil en línea. Existe la necesidad de un pensamiento sistémico y un enfoque multisectorial concertado para mejorar la alfabetización digital y proteger a los niños en línea.

 3 s well as a vital cornerstone of general education, digital literacy is one of the guiding forces in the growth of the digital age. In order to encourage Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG)-Quality Education, developing countries have integrated digital literacy into general education, making it an active part of the digital economy for the majority of their people (Urbancikova, Manakova & Ganna, 2017).  There are two common terms ³Digital divide´ and ³digital inclusion´, which relate to connectivity and internet utilization that have gained popularity (Nemer, 2015). The real origin of the term ³Digital divide´ is not known but it was advanced and began to be widely used in the mid-1990s to describe the disparity between households that have access to the Internet and households that do not have access to the Internet (Light, 2001; Pigato, 2001). However, this divide continues to persist today in the wake of COVID-19 (Aissaoui, 2021). Catalysts for bridging the digital divide on what former US Vice President Gore called ³the information superhighway´ was the notion of ICTs as global education and economic equalizer (Cerf, 2019). Computers were introduced in college classrooms around the world, and are making their way into primary and secondary schools in wealthy cities including developing countries (Tatnall, 1992; Tatnall & Davey, 2004). Access to the Internet is seen as a way to change education in profound ways.  Another term ³digital inclusion later took a centre stage among media and researchers. This term described the differences that existed between hardware and broadband access, in particular, this was about access to ICT knowledge in the home, the school, and the workplace. These disparities in digital access that remained among poor, undereducated, and racial-ethnic minorities and may affect the quality of life although (Ali, Alam, Taylor & Rafiq, 2020) observe studies have shown mixed results (Helsper, 2008; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). The solution to inclusion is often described as community building, therefore grassroots organizations and community centers began offering access to ICTs through their facilities.  Digital inclusion presupposes that people who are not connected to ICTs want to join the digital society and need assistance in understanding the importance of the technology. Rather than trying to find who was not connected, the notion put forward in digital inclusion was to work toward bringing underserved populations²people in underdeveloped and developing nations; poor, undereducated people and racial-ethnic minorities in the United A  Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 4 States; and minority populations around the world²into the already existing digital society. The word ³inclusion´ is perceived as being more forward-thinking than the term ³divide´ when it comes to describing the state of digital affairs. Despite the shift in terminology and focus, several scholars and organizations around the world remain committed to the concept of the digital divide. In doing so, they have discovered more nuanced approaches to understanding the digital divide. The second wave of digital divide interrogates access as both physical and intellectual, and usage as place and purpose was introduced by Hargittai (2001) by investigating user differences in ICT skills.  According to Bean and Kern (2018), digital literacy is seen in the light of praxeology as school teachers carry out educational practices aimed at reducing risk behaviors facilitated by digital media and most frequently associated with: student cyberbullying (PyĪalski, 2012). The digital environment has been blamed for underutilised opportunities for learning, creativity, and social connectivity (Lomax, Murray & Pyer, 2018). According to the House of Lords (2017 as cited in Lomax, Murray and Pyer 2018), no child should leave school without a well-rounded understanding of the digital world. Digital literacy concepts have slight differences in reach or focus areas, and their meanings often overlap (Zhang & Zhu, 2016). Digital literacy is described as ³intelligence assembly´ by Paul Gilster (1997 as cited in Pool, 1997, p.9) and includes ³how to assimilate the information, analyze it, and reintegrate it.´ Digital literacy refers to the ability of individuals to use skills, knowledge, and understanding to make full use of the opportunities offered by the new media world as well as safeguard themselves from associated risks (Martin, 2005 as cited in Buckingham, 2007):   ³Digital literac\ is the aZareness, attitude and abilit\ of individuals to appropriately use digital tools and facilities to identify, access, manage, integrate, evaluate, analyse and synthesize digital resources, construct new knowledge, create media expressions, and communicate with others, in the context of specific life situations, to enable constructive social action; and to reflect upon this process´ (Martin, 2005, p. 135 as cited in Buckingham, 2007).  International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 5 Digital literacy can be seen as an umbrella concept that includes elements of other literature that share conceptual grounds with other forms of literacy, such as knowledge literacy that is capable of identifying, finding, assessing and using information (UNESCO, 2018; Cummins, Becker & Alexander, 2016), media literacy that is, the ability to access, recognize and critically evaluate media messages (Koltay, 2011) and news media literacy. i.e., the ability to apply core media literacy skills to news (Vraga, Tully, Kotcher, Smithson & Broeckelman-post, 2015; Maksl, Craft, Ashley & Miller, 2017). Digital literacy skills include but are not limited to Instrumental (or essential or functional), insightful (comprehension, navigation, assessment), and social (communication, disclosure, privacy) (Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). There worldwide recognition of the importance for children to be digitally literate (CoE, 2018; Keeley & Little, 2017), although there are limited studies on relationship between digital literacy and online safety (Nascimbeni & Vosloo, 2019).  According to Sonck and de Haan (2014), there are very few longitudinal studies looking at the relationship between digital skills and threats online. Kids, like teenagers, are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills (Rodríguez de Dios, 2018; Sonck & de Haan, 2014; Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). Besides, research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital capabilities will gain more from online opportunities (Lee & Chae, 2012; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Nikken & Schols, 2015; Sonck & de Haan, 2013). Certain empirical studies, on the contrary, have shown that the more qualified teenagers there are, the more risks they face online (Lee & Chae, 2012; Leung & Lee, 2012; Livingstone, Ólafsson, Helsper, Lupiáñez-Villanueva, Veltri & Folkvord, 2017; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Sonck & de Haan, 2013; Staksrud et al., 2013).  According to Joyce, Pham, Stanton Fraser, Payne, Crellin & McDougall (2014), the history of digital literacy and online education projects has been patchy for example in the UK despite recent calls for a clear curriculum for digital media education since media education aims to teach students how to become critical media users through media analysis and media production (Children's Commissioner, 2017; Hobbs as cited in Polizzi, 2020). Previous research according to Marsh, Hannon, Lewis, & Ritchie (2017) and Plowman et al. (2012) showed the early establishment of 'digital literacy' in young children (0-8) and learning through home technology. Citing Görzig, and Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 6 Ólafsson (2011), Livingstone, Davidson, Bryce, Batool, Haughton, and Nandi (2017) observed that girls tended to report slightly fewer digital skills than boys and younger children reported considerably fewer skills than older teenagers. Moreover, skills of children with disabilities, who are discriminated against, or who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, vary ± some have fewer skills commensurate with their fewer resources or available supports, but others have developed skills partly through facing negative experiences online (Livingstone et al., 2017).  Children¶s digital literacy changed qualitatively with age for example, at around 9 to 10 years, children were concerned with what was real or not, although they would not discriminate real from fake. At 11 to 13 years children were more concerned with what was fun or even transgressive, irrespective of whether it was trustworthy. Lastly, by 14 to 16 years their increasing maturity led teenagers to refocus on what was more valuable for them or more generally (Livingstone, 2014; Livingstone, Kirwil, Ponte & Staksrud, 2014). The shift in focus would be brought about by a change in peer and parental relations with the children and had implications for the incidence of online risks encountered by children (Ofcom, 2016). Children¶s digital literacy was found to increase fairly steadily from age 8 to young adulthood. Also, with increasing age, children gained digital literacy to realise that some but not all search engine results could be trusted (Ofcom, 2016).  A study comparing EU Kids Online and Net Children Go Mobile also showed little change in the levels of children¶s digital literacy and safety skills since 2010, although children are now better able to manage their privacy settings and to delete their browsing history. On the other hand, the same comparison showed that the proportion of children whose profiles were public had nearly doubled from 11 to 19% of social network users aged between 9 to 16, which may reflect the diversification in social networks used (Livingstone et al., 2014). Schools are an important partner in ensuring child protection online (Shipton, 2011). E-safety guidance from schools is particularly helpful for children from under-resourced households where parents lack confidence or expertise concerning digital media (Livingstone, Mascheroni, Dreier, Chaudron & Lagae, 2015). Whittle, Hamilton-Giachritsis, and Beech (2014) found that support from schools along with support from parents and friends also assisted with the recovery of victims of online grooming and sexual abuse. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 7 According to Ofcom (2016), e-safety strategies and initiatives schools would use in protecting children online include annual talks, some with members of the police and/or NSPCC representatives, information videos and associated lesson plans: ³We saw a video on CBBC about a girl and Direction and she gave out her details and didn¶t realize.´ (Girl, 8-9 years old, Nottingham), e-safety pupil representatives: ³I am an e-Safety rep at school and we help to tell [others] how to be safe online.´ (Girl, 8-9 years old, Nottingham), take-home µcontracts¶ to share with parents to agree to terms of safe internet use and a Safer Internet Day, held once a year, and other campaigns. In studying two primary schools, Shipton (2011) found that the schools preferred developing the critical capabilities of the students rather than employing blanket filters. This was done to ensure that children can manage risks both at school and elsewhere. Aston and Brzyska (2012) further strengthen the argument for developing critical capacities among children by observing that majority of teachers felt that their pupils had the skills and knowledge to use the internet safely in school yet only 58% felt that the children were similarly equipped to use it safely at home. Other scholars, Byrne et al. (2016) revealed that high percentages of children had basic digital literacy skills but only about 20% (on average) used the internet for creative activities (creating blogs, videos, and websites). Studies show that the more digitally literate children become, the more they can gain from the internet while avoiding or coping with online risks (Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). According to Rouchun, Zongkui, Shuailei, Qingqi and Chen (2019, citing Bronfenbrenner, 1989), the family atmosphere is the most critical micro-system that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socio-economic status as a distal environment. Access to, familiarity with, and skill using mobile devices are a first step in achieving digital literacy. A study showed that most children started using mobile devices in their first year of life, and use was enabled by parents who gave children a device to use and to keep. Three out of four parents gave children a mobile device when doing chores and to keep them calm (Kabali, Irigoyen, Nunez-Davis, Budacki, Mohanty, Leister & Bonner, 2015). µDigital literacy¶ or µe-skills¶ is crucial to children¶s use of the internet. Internet literacy is a capability constitutive to utilizing the advantages of the Internet and as Knobel and Lankshear (2006) assert has a close relationship with participation in cyber-culture. Byrne et al. (2016) observe that the Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 8 creation of online content by children is a means of self-expression as well as an important vehicle for participation in matters that affect them, participation being one of the underlying principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. A broad concept of Internet literacy refers to the information, skills, and behaviors used in a wide range of digital devices such as smartphones, laptops, PCs, etc. (Taylor & Dalal, 2014 citing Julian, 2013). Cyber-safety risks for children when using video sharing platforms, websites, social networking sites, and games include but are not limited to: Exposure to pornography; Violent content; Contact and conduct risks; Cyberbullying and associated low self-esteem and emotional responses; Contact with strangers and online predation; Content and practices that are not age appropriate through viewing media used by older siblings; Identity theft; and Malware (Robinson, 2013 citing Green et al., 2011). The children¶s limited digital literacy skills increase the potential for harm to them. One report noted children of [primary school] age are particularly challenged in their cognitive and emotional abilities to cope with online risk. It follows then, that these risks increase where adult supervision is inadequate (Baldry, Sorrentino & Farrington, 2019). A study by Tomczyk (2019) in the field of digital security in the school and family environment in Poland revealed that digital literacy was necessary, especially in a group of people who are responsible for facilitating digital safety. A good example is parents who are in contact with children all the time and most time give digital devices to children under their care with good reasons or to keep them off so that they can concentrate on their work.   Parents have to ensure an appropriate degree of digital protection at home since previous study revealed a positive relation between socio-economic status and digital literacy Tran et al. (2020). However, a study by Moawad and Ebrahem (2016) reported a negative correlation between adolescents¶ technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology, the more their social interaction with their parents was affected.  On the other hand, teachers help their students improve their digital literacy (Savage, 2015). Because of the nature of their work, teachers also have a responsibility to create approaches that promote effective media exposure and socialisation. This is only feasible if teachers have sufficient and up-to-date information about the risks emerging from digital media prevalence. Teachers International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 9 particularly teaching in primary school bear particular responsibility for ensuring digital safety (Cortina-Pérez, Gallardo-Vigil, Jiménez-Jiménez & Trujillo-Torres, 2014). At the educational point, teachers can influence the behaviors of students that would allow them to protect themselves from traditional and non-standard e-threats such as problem Internet usage, cyberbullying, image security, recognition of false information, sexting, copyright infringements, hygiene of digital media navigation, sensitivity to Internet challenges Digital literacy is undergoing constant changes as the information system is undergoing simultaneous transformations. Digital literacy requires not just the technological capacity to use digital media, but also the mechanisms linked to risky behavior awareness. A study in the UK showed that one would be termed as internet literate when they can: find information confidently, they can send an instant message, fix a problem on their computer or set up an email account or even download music. Internet literate children may also be able to filter or remove a virus from their computer among other activities. Boys were found to be more skilled than girls. For example, when a girl was able to send an instant message, a boy would be able to download music. The study also revealed that internet skills increased with age (Livingstone, Bober, & Helsper, 2005). Kenya, with a population of over 48.5 million people (as of 2016), is generally regarded as one of Africa's most technologically advanced nations. According to estimates, about 85 percent of the population is covered by third generation (3 G) technology in2017, but only 17.8% of individuals and 33.7 percent of households have internet access. In addition, Kenya's telecommunications revenues increased from USD 1.32 billion in 2014 to USD 1.65 billion in 2016 (Okyere, 2020 citing ITU, 2018).  Materials and Methods  The study was carried out in Nairobi City County specifically Langata Sub-county. Langata Sub-county is one of the nine sub-counties in Nairobi City County which is one of the 47 counties in the Republic of Kenya. The Sub-County lies in the South West of Nairobi, bordering Kajiado County to the North. This sub-county has four divisions and eight wards namely: Karen, Hardy, Lenana, Nairobi West, Olympic, Mugumuini, Bomas, and South C (County, 2018). This study site was selected because of its accessibility to Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 10 cyber cafes and high-speed Internet and the availability of many schools that had very well equipped computer labs and ICT Innovation Centres and good internet connection. It was also preferred because it housed the various levels of population in terms of socio-economic status comprising of the high class, the middle class, and the low class which is not characteristic of the other sub-counties within Nairobi City County. This sub-county also had several Information technology innovation centres. The researchers utilized a descriptive cross-sectional design within a concurrent mixed approach collecting and analysing both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time (McCusker & Gunaydin, 2015). The study targeted children between ages 9 years and 17 years old from selected private and public primary schools in Langata Sub-county, teachers, parents and policy makers within the Department of children services and Directorate of Criminal Investigation. Godden¶s formula informed the sample size determination of 384 respondents, plus 10% of the sample size to cater for non-response by respondents making a total of 423 respondents. Key Informant interviews were also carried out targeting 9 parents, 9 Key informant teacher respondents, 2 Key informant Child protection officer respondents all sampled purposively.  The researchers utilised simple random, stratified purposive sampling, stratified sampling, convenience, and purposive sampling designs. Three schools were selected from three regions within Langata Sub-county which included: Karen, South C, and Mugumuini wards. The study sought both empirical data and secondary data from published sources like general and specific search engines. Interviews and focused group discussions were carried (5 FGDs) which enabled the collection of data using interview guides, questionnaires, and FGD guides tools. Quantitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of SPSS version 22. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were applied to examine relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Data were transformed to enable further inferential statistics to relate variables and help test hypotheses. Findings were presented using graphs, frequencies, charts, and tables. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis with the help of Nvivo version 12 and presented in narrative and map forms. Informed written consent was sought in writing and verbally from all respondents including teachers, parents, children and protection officers following the right International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 11 procedure, who were prepared in advance on the nature of questioning including the degree of sensitivity of the subject. Parents and guardians were approached to give consent on behalf of their children. All participants were allowed to take part in the study. However, they were informed that if they wished to withdraw from the study at some point then they were allowed.  Ultimate confidentiality was observed in regards to the individuals sampled for purposes of data collection, especially regarding the case studies. No information provided by the children, teachers, parents, child protection officers, and government officials was shared with any other person for any purpose other than supervisors and where was required so to prepare this research report. Lastly, the researcher disseminated research findings as planned.  Results and Discussion  This section presents characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents. Besides, the researchers present the type of schools respondents attended, the risky actions by respondents when they go online and the categories of cyberbullying and abuse experienced while online. Finally presented was digital literacy that was measured using twenty-five items among the respondents.  Table 1.  Distribution by response rate  Frequency  Percentage  Complete questionnaires  370 87% Not Completed questionnaires  53 13% Total  423 100% Source (Field data, 2019)  The researchers purposively selected 12 primary schools, two private schools and two public schools per ward in the selected three wards out of the eight that existed from within Langata Sub-county in Nairobi. The total sample was 423 pupils, out of which 370 successfully filled and returned questionnaires. The researchers invited children respondents aged 9 years to 17 years enrolled in primary public and private schools in Langata Sub-County in Nairobi City County in Kenya to participate in the study. Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 12 Questionnaires were administered to the children and out of the 423 questionnaires, 53 (13%) of the children either refused to or did not return their questionnaires. A good number 370 (87%) filled the questionnaires successfully and returned. The questionnaires that were filled successfully were sufficient for analysis for a response rate. That shows that automatically the study sample remained 370 respondents.   Demographic Profile of Respondents   This section presents the characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents. The characteristics of the children were, age, gender, class, type of school, residence and level of education of parents. Of the 370 respondents, 49.2 % were girls while 188 (50.2%) were boys. The findings revealed that the highest number of those who successfully filled and returned questionnaires were class six pupils forming a 22.2% (82) as shown in table 3. The study found that 91 (24.6%) were 12 years old followed by 78 (21.1%) 61 (16.5%) were 13 years old as the least number. This may be attributed to the fact that most pupils after age 13 may have transited to secondary school. The highest number of respondents 38.4% (142) resided in the Mugumuini area followed by the Karen area 37.3% (138) and only 24.3% (90) resided in South C because the response rate was low in South C ward. The study showed that 175 (47.3%) pupils in public schools accessed the internet while 191 (51.6%) in private schools accessed the internet. This revealed that a higher number of children in private schools access the internet compared to those in public schools. This was because in private schools children used the internet even for their homework assignments. A very small but equal number of 2(0.5%) respondents did not access the internet. Children from private schools were from higher social economic status and therefore their parents afford internet and internet access gadgets. According to Rouchun, Zongkui, Shuailei, Qingqi and Chen (2019 citing Bronfenbrenner, 1989), the family atmosphere is the most critical micro-system that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socio-economic status as a distal environment. Earlier survey results showed that families with elevated socio-economic status had more Internet access devices and more Internet access resources for children (Lenhart et al., 2001). The findings concur with a related study by Tran et al. (2020) revealing a positive International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)

The online action considered less risky was gaming at 5.7% (21). This means that the children had experienced abuse through some videos. They reported having watched music video clips they considered offensive. Almost half the respondents 48.6% (180) had experienced bullying that involved strangers sharing pictures and videos with them. Some children 27 % reported having experienced abuse through text messages through phones. Whatsapp and e-mail recorded the lowest 5.4% (20) considering it not easily used for cyberbullying. Only 5.4 % had experienced abuse through the e-mail. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 15 Most of the children did not either know how to use mails or use mails often, the reason for a low percentage. Few 5.4 % had experienced abuse through WhatsApp since it was a smartphone application and few of them had their phones. Those who had experienced abuse through WhatsApp agreed to have shared with siblings or those who owned phones. Others cited Facebook as a site where they experienced abuse.  Table 5.

The children were at risks of exposure online for example:  ³When children access the internet the\ pla\ games like ³Blue Whales´ Zhich ma\ be disastrous. A good e[ample is Zhen children end up committing suicide.´ When children accept friend requests on social media and other platforms that exist it is risky because some are abducted mostly because they are interacting with people who enjoy anonymity. It is scary that some pose as children and children easily trust and start engaging them. These online strangers ask children for information and family details Zhich makes the children more vulnerable to trafficking.´ (Respondent 3, 7th, March, 2019)  Digital literacy was measured using twenty-five items among the respondents and the results revealed the following: Findings on whether they frequently used the internet for schoolwork, 165 (44.6) strongly disagreed while 12 (3.2%) disagreed showing that more than half did not frequently use Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse

Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 18 The findings revealed that children were limited in skills concerning digital literacy and were therefore highly internet illiterate and this would either expose them to online abuse or even would shield them from predators since they were not so much exposed to internet risk. In comparison to what was indicated by prior literature, kids, like teenagers, are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills (Rodríguez de Dios, 2018; Sonck & de Haan, 2014; Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). Besides, research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital capabilities will gain more from online opportunities (Lee & Chae, 2012; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Nikken & Schols, 2015; Sonck & de Haan, 2013). Certain empirical studies, on the contrary, have shown that the more qualified teenagers there are, the more risks they face online (Lee & Chae, 2012; Leung & Lee, 2012; Livingstone et al., 2017; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Sonck & de Haan, 2013).  Online coping is one-way children can deal with online child abuse-related encounters. It can be defined as µinternet-specific problem-solving strategies children adopt after a negative experience online¶ (Vandoninck et al., 2013, p. 61). A study by the EU Kids Online identified three main coping strategies: passive responses, that include fatalistic (stop using the internet for while) and self-accusatory responses (feeling guilty about what happened); proactive responses (such as reporting inappropriate content and contact, blocking the unwanted contact, etc.); and communicative responses (talking with parents, peers, teachers or other trusted adults about what happened) (Livingstone, Haddon, Görzig, & Ólafsson, 2011). Learning how to cope with negative experiences effectively is one of the most effective responses for any particular situation which is part of the process of building resilience among internet users (Vandoninck et al., 2013). Responding to online risks by seeking support from social networks is the most common coping strategy adopted by children, although in most cases they tend to combine two strategies (Livingstone et al., 2011).    Pearson Correlation   Correlations estimate the strength of the linear relationship between two (and only two) variables. Correlation coefficients range from -1.0 (a perfect negative correlation) to positive 1.0 (a perfect positive correlation). The closer International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 19 correlation coefficients get to -1.0 or 1.0, the stronger the correlation. The closer a correlation coefficient gets to zero, the weaker the correlation is between the two variables. Ordinal or ratio data (or a combination) must be used. After testing the hypothesis stated below, the researcher obtained the following results as interpreted them as shown:  H0 There is no relationship between exposure to the internet and digital literacy  The correlation coefficient for exposure to the internet and digital online literacy was 0.041. The number of respondents in the sample answering both items is 370 and 376 respectively. The p-value for this correlation coefficient was .431. There is a weak positive relationship between exposure to the internet and children internet digital literacy.  Table 7.

The researcher used two-tailed because the direction was not known earlier. As shown in the table, a p-value of .431 indicates that the correlation is not significant and the two variables exposure and digital literacy are not linearly related. This implied that even if the children are exposed to the internet that alone does not improve much of their digital or internet literacy hence there is a need for them to be guided and assisted to navigate while using the internet for their security. It can further be interpreted that children exposed to the Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 20 internet would fall prey to predators and abusers whose tricks are dynamic and they are always ahead of the children. This is in agreement with Krueger (2002) who discovered Internet skills (the ability to access the web) was the most significant indicator of online participation) and deal with emails. People who are more familiar with the Internet and have good social skills and communication skills would benefit more from internet use, consistent with the Rich-Get-Richer-Theory (Kraut et al., 2002).   Table 8.

Other respondents, 64 (17.3 %) said it was a bit true,¶ 33 (8.9 %) agreed it was true their parents were more knowledgeable than them on matters internet and 15 (4.1 %) gave other reasons. This concurs with a study by Livingstone et al. (2015) on how parents of young children manage digital devices at home. Children don¶t believe that they have more internet abilities than their parents (Livingstone et al., 2015). This meant children had confidence in their parents guiding them on how to use the internet and keep safe. However, this is contrary to a study by Moawad and Ebrahem (2016) that reported a negative correlation between adolescents¶ technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology, the more their social interaction with their parents was affected. This raises the question of interaction and guidance provided by parents as indicated in this study although this study sample included younger children who may be more trusting to their parents compared to adolescents who listen to their peers more.

Respondents thought that they knew a lot of things about the internet meaning they were confident in their teachers guiding and protecting them while using the internet. A further 32.4% (120) respondents felt that it was not true that they know more about the internet while a small percentage 8.1% (30) thought it was not true they knew a lot about the internet. The reason being that they were either not accessing the internet, they were not digitally literate or they were not confident enough.  Conclusion  Access to cyber-space is no longer a luxury, but an everyday activity for many teachers and learners in the school environment, at home and other environments like cyber. This study found there was early access, early exposure, and early adoption of mobile media devices among young children in an urban, low-income, moderate, and high-income community. Online child abuse is today recognised as a global phenomenon since the internet has been found to have a powerful impact on the lives of children throughout the world. This would continue to grow and evolve. While Internet access and child usage were highest in industrialized countries, the global pace of web access and broadband penetration, and the exponential uptake of mobile phone technologies, coupled with increasing capacities and decreasing costs, means that the rest of the world is beginning to catch up in the next few years, Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 22 it is anticipated that the most dramatic changes will occur in low- and middle-income countries. Based on the findings of this study the researchers concluded that the responsibility of online child protection was for every stakeholder including the state, parents, teachers, citizens, netizens, and children themselves. It was also concluded that training and the creation of awareness were important elements to consider in protecting children online. The study revealed low skills among parents and teachers on internet matters yet children looked up to them and believed they would guide them in remaining safe online. Children were found to be digitally literate. Digital literacy helped children to remain safe as well as exposing them to internet-related risks as was revealed by other studies.  Only a small proportion of contemporary adults had access to ICT when they were children, particularly the tools that have facilitated the revolution in interaction and communication This has probably affected the ability of adults to understand and empathize with the ways children and young people use the Internet, mobile phones and other new technologies. This may be especially true in societies where children¶s social activity, particularly that of adolescents, has been under fairly direct parental observation or control.  Recommendations  The government needs to develop strategies through the Ministry of Education to create institutional capacity to respond to online child abuse to educate minors in the responsible use of ICT. Moreover, programs for the prevention of cyberbullying should also integrate issues related to education about sexting and sexual solicitation among other harmful online child abuse issues. Holistic intervention concerning the different risks found on the Internet is also necessary following the fast and dynamic nature of the growth, accessibility, and availability of the internet which people are exposed to as early as 4 months. Moreover, sexual education programs in schools should address sexting, as it seems to be a new avenue through which adolescents express their sexuality. Besides, educators particularly teachers and parents should be informed about Internet risks and how to protect their children to educate their children on the responsible use of ICT with emphasis on digital skills. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 23 The onus is on governments and the private sector to ensure that protection is integrated into promoting the expansion of access and the positive benefits the Internet brings. Cyber security awareness and training ought to be a top priority for all African states. This should be cross-cutting from the vulnerable sector or people in the society, school-going children, families, industry captains, critical national infrastructure handlers, government officials, and the entire African continent with its unique needs. The government of Kenya through the Communications Authority to first track: Establishing a database on reported cybercrime cases affecting children; Commissioning of national research on Online Child Sexual Exploitation, which once completed would provide a more reliable and full picture of OCSE in Kenya; Developing a training curriculum that could be used to train stakeholders on online safety of children and related risks and Developing a National Child Online Framework Strategy. The government needs to put in place the policy, legal and regulatory framework which is also important. That would require the involvement and support of the political leadership and goodwill at the very highest level. The lawmakers must be well trained and sensitised to help implement legislation that addresses cyber threats at all levels. There is a need to address online child abuse at the continental level. African countries need strong Information and Computer Technology institutions. This may be utilised to train cyber security experts in system administration, security audit, forensic investigation, information security, and software development to deal with the future challenges of cybercrime.

Publics see mobile phones and social media bringing certain benefits 
to them and their societies . But these views are paired with 
widespread concerns about their impact on children  
After more than a decade of studying the spread and impact of digital life in the United States , Pew 
Research Center has intensified its exploration of the impact of online connectivity among 
populations in emerging economies – where the prospect of swift and encompassing cul tural 
change propelled by digital devices might be even more dramatic  than the effects felt in developed 
societies.  
Surveys conducted in 11 emerging and d eveloping countries across four global regions find that the 
vast majority of adults in these countries own – or have access to – a mobile phone of some kind.1 
And these mobile phones are not simply basic devices with little more than voice and texting 
capacity: A median of 5 3% across these nations now have access to a smartphone capable of 
accessing the internet and running apps.   
In concert with this development, social media platforms and messaging apps – most notably, 
Facebook and WhatsApp – are widely used . Across the surveyed countries, a median of 64% use at 
least one of seven different social media sites or messaging apps.2 Indeed, smartphones and social 
media have melded  so thoroughly that for many they go hand -in-hand. A median of 91 % of 
smartphone users  in these countries also use social media , while a median of 81 % of soc ial media 
users say they own or share a smartphone .  
1 Throughout this report,  mobile phone users include those who say they own or share a mobile  phone. 
2 The su rvey a sked r espondents whether they u se seven d ifferent s ocial m edia a nd messaging platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, 
WhatsApp, S napchat a nd Viber, plus t he dating app Tinder. Throughout this r eport, r eferences t o “social media p latform a nd m essaging a pp 
users” o r “social media u sers” e ncompass anyone who u ses one or more o f these se ven d ifferent si tes. F or more i nformation on the use o f 
these  platforms in d ifferent c ountries and b y different demographic group s, please see Chapter 1 of this report. What is a median?  
Throughout this report, median percentages are used to help readers see overall patterns. The median is th e 
middle number in a list of figures sorted in ascending or descending order. In a survey of 11 countries, the 
median result is the sixth figure on a list of country -level findings ranked in order.  5

 People in these nations say mobile p hones  
have help ed them personally in various ways . 
Among mobile phone users, an 11- country 
median of 93% say these devices have helped 
them stay in touch with people who live far 
away, and a somewhat smaller share (a 
median of 79%) say they have helped the m 
obtain news and information about important 
issues. More broadly, majorities of adults in all 11 countries say the internet has had a good 
impact on education –  and majorities in 10  of 11 countries say the same of mobile phones.  
At the same time, smaller shares of adults in these nations  say mobile phones and social media 
have been good for society than say these technologies have been good for them personally. A nd 
the challenges that digital life can pose for children  are a particularly notable source of concern . 
Some 79% of adults in these countries say people should be very  concerned about children being “Facebook has brought a lot of advantages 
for our society. However, it has also 
affected society in a negative way. Just like 
anything which can be used for both good 
and bad, social media have brought 
negatives and positives for people.”  
-Man, 22, Philippines  The 11 countries in this report and why they were included  
This report is the first of several  reports  that will be issued this year based on nationally  representative 
surveys of adults age s 18 and older conducted in 11 countries located in four different regions of the globe: 
Mexico, Venezuela and Colombia; South Africa and Kenya; India, Vietnam and the Philippines; and Tunisia, 
Jordan and Lebanon.  
These countries were selected for the survey based on a number of crite ria. Key goals of the country 
selection process were to assemble a group of countries that:  
 Are middle -income countries  as defined by the World Bank.  
 Contain a mix of people with different sorts of devices.  Many of these countries have notable variation  
in the share of their populations who have smartphones, more basic phones –  or no phones at all.  
 Offer country -level diversity and variety.  These countries offer a variety of regional, pol itical, economic, 
social, cultural, population size and geographic conditions.  
 Vary in their market conditions.  These countries differ in their technological and industry 
competitiveness , and have a range of “networked readiness” ratings as calculated by the World 
Economic Forum .   
 In many cases have high levels of internal or external migration . Each of these countries exhibits 
rising levels of urbanization , and most still have substantial  rural populations. A special report examining 
the impact of mobile phones on the migrant experience is also forthcoming.

 exposed to harmful or immoral content when using mobile phones, and a median of 63% say 
mobile phones have had a b ad influence on children in their country. They also express mixed 
opinions about the impact of increased connectivity on physical health and morality .  
Some of these tensions between the upsides and downsides of digital life span all 11 countries 
surveyed . At other times, there are nation -specific elements to people’s views about  what these 
technologies have brought to their lives . For instance, more than half of mobile phone users in five 
of these countries describe their phone as something they couldn’t live without –  but users in six 
countries are more likely to describe it as something they don’t always need.  
These are among the major findings from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted among 28,122 adults  in 11 countries from Sept. 7 to Dec. 7, 2018. In addition to the survey, the Center 
conducted focus groups with diverse groups of participants in Kenya, Mexico, the Philippines and 
Tunisia in March 2018 , and their comments are included throughout the repo rt.  
 
  How the focus groups were conducted  
Pew Research Center conducted a series of focus groups to better understand how people think about their 
own mobile phones and the impact of these devices on their society. Five focus groups were held in each of 
the following four countries: Kenya, Mexico, the Philippines and Tunisia. Each focus group consisted of 10 
adults coming together for an hour and a ha lf for a discussion led by a local, professional moderator using a 
guide developed by the Center. For more information on how these groups were conducted, see Appendix A . 
These groups were primarily used to help shape the survey questions asked in each of the 11 countries. But, throughout the report, we have also included quotations that illustrate some of the major themes that were discussed during the groups. Quotations are chosen to provide context for  the survey fin dings and do  not 
necessarily represent the majority opinion in any particular group or country. Quotations may have been 
edited for gramma r and  clarity.

 Majorities say  mobile phones and social 
media have mostly bee n good for them 
personally, somewhat less so for society 
Asked for their overall assessment of the impact 
of mobile devices and social media platforms on 
society and their own lives, people in these 
nations generally are more affirming than not. But within this broadly positive consensus, 
there are important nuances . 
First, at both a personal and societal level 
publics are generally more likely to say mobile 
phones have had a mostly good impact than t o 
say the same of social media . A median of 70% 
of adults across these 11 countries say mobile 
phones have been a mostly good thing for society, but that share falls to 57% on the 
question of the impact of social media. Indeed, 
a median of 27% think social media have  been a 
mostly bad thing for society.  
Second, these publics are more likely to say that both mobile pho nes and social media have been 
mostly good for them personally than they are to say they have been mostly good for society. As 
noted above , an 11 -country median of 70% say that mobile phones have been mostly good for 
society. But an even larger share of 82 % say mobile phones have been mostly good for them 
personally . When it comes to social media, users of these sites are generally more likely to 
proclaim their benefits than non- users. Even among users, people’s views of their personal impact 
tend to be mor e positive than their views of their societal impact.  
These broad themes tend to occur across the full scope of the countries surveyed. But Kenyans and 
Vietnamese stand out somewhat for their more positive views of the societal impact of both mobile 
phones  and social media. Conversely, relatively large shares of Venezuelans view the societal 
impact of these technologies as a negative one.

 Many worry th at mobile phones are a problem for children ; it is common for parents to 
attempt to curtail and surveil their child’s screen time  
While on balance people in these nations express 
largely positive judgments about the personal and societal impact of technologies , they also 
express significant concerns over the effects 
mobile phones and online connectivity might 
have on young people. Wo rries that mobile 
phones might expose children to immoral or 
harmful content are a key flashpoint in these 
fears. A median of 79% of adults in these 11 
countries – and majorit ies in all countr ies 
surveyed – say people should be very  concerned 
about this.  More broadly, a median of 54% say 
the increasing use of the inte rnet has had a bad 
influence on children  in their country , and a 
median of 63% say t he same about mobile 
phones.  
Coupled with these concerns, m any parents say 
they try to be vigilant about what their children 
are doing and seeing on their phones.
3 Among 
parents whose children h ave mobile phones, a 
median of 5 0% say they monitor what their 
children do on their mobile devices. P arents who 
are themselves smartphone or social media users 
are more li kely than non- users to monitor their 
child’s phone in this way. Along with monitoring 
their children’s activities on their mobile devices, 
a median of 52% of parents whose children have 
mobile phones have tried to limit the time their children spend with t heir phones.  
Beyond these concerns about the influence of connectivity on children, people’s views of the 
broader impact of digital technologies on family life are more positive . For instance, the vast

 majority of mobile phone users (a median of 93% across the 11 countries) say their phone has 
helped them stay in touch with people who live far away . And although m ajorities of Lebanese 
(70%) and Jordanians  (62%) feel that mobile phones have had a bad influence on family cohesion, 
in most  other  countries surv eyed, more say  mobile phones have had a good influence in this regard  
than a bad one .  
Publics are divided over the role mobile 
phones play in their lives  
Overall, mobile phone users  tend to associate 
their mobile phones with feelings of freedom. In 
every country  surveyed , a larger sha re of mobile 
phone users describe their phone as something that frees them as opposed to something that ties 
them down. 
When it comes to whether their phones help 
them save time or make them waste time , the 
largest share of mobile phone users in seven 
coun tries describe their phone as something that 
helps them save time. Still, larger share s of 
Jordanians and Filipinos describe their phone as something that makes them waste time. And in Lebanon and Mexico, roughly equal shares  see 
their phone as a time save r and time waster.  
Across the 11 countries surveyed, m obile phone users fall into two camps about whether their 
phone is something they don’t always need  or something they couldn’t live without. Kenyans, 
South Africans, Jordanians, Tunisians and Lebanese who use a mobile phone are more likely to 
say their phone is something they couldn’t live without. But in the six other countries, larger 
share s say they don’t always need their phone.  
Both phone type  and demographic differences 
are at the core of these assessments about  the 
value of mobile phones in users’ lives. For 
instance, adults ages 50 and older are more 
likely than those under 30 to view their phone  
as a time saver, while younger adults are more Across 11 countries, more see mobile 
phones as freeing, time saving

 likely to view it as a time waster – a relationship that persists in most countries even when 
accounting for ag e-related differences in  smartphone  use. And although mobile phone users tend 
to see their phone as something that frees them, the prevalence of these attitudes varies by device 
type. For instance, in most countries, smartphone users are more likely than basic or feature 
phone users  to say their phone is something that ties them down rather than something that frees 
them.  
Publics in these countries say mobile phones have a beneficial impact on certain aspects 
of society, but a more negative influence on others  
People’s assessments of the 
specific societal impacts of 
mobile phones vary depending 
on the aspect of society in 
question. Broadly, people in 
most countries think mobile 
phones and the internet have had similar impacts on society 
– possibly because for many 
their online access comes 
through a mobile phone.  
In most countries, education 
stands out as the issue where 
the largest share of adults say 
the increasing use of the 
internet and mobile phones has 
had a good impact. A median of 
67% say this about the impact 
of mobile phones , and a median 
of 71% about the internet . 
Public attitudes regarding the 
influence of the internet on education  have grown more positive since 2014
 in six of the countries 
studied here (Jordan, S outh Africa, Kenya, Vietnam, Lebanon and Mexico), while falling in 
Tunisia.  
Adults in the 11 nations surveyed also view these technologies as having a largely good influence 
on the economy: A  median of 58% say this of mobile phones and 56% say same about t he internet. Across 11 emerging economies, majorities think 
mobile phones have been beneficial for education  and 
the economy – but negative for children

 And i n seven of the 10  countries for which trends are available, more people today say the 
increasing use of the internet has had a good influence on their country’s economy than said the 
same in 2014.4 
But digital connectivity is seen in a less positive 
light when it comes to other issues. In addition 
to their widespread worries about the impact on children , publics in these countries also express 
mixed views about increased connectivity ’s 
impact  on health. An 11 -country median of 40% 
say mobile phones have had a bad influence on 
physical health , and 37% say the same of the 
internet. Majorities of the public in Jordan, 
Lebanon and Tunisia view these technologies as having a negative influence  on health.  
In addition, a  median of 35% say that both mobile phones and the internet have had a bad 
influence on morality. In four countries for which trend  data are available (Kenya, Venezuela , 
Mexico  and Colombia ), larger share s of the public say the internet has had a good influence on 
morality than was true four years ago. But in Jordan  and Lebanon, the share s saying this have  
declined since 2014.  
When  people consider i ssues such as the impact of digital tools on local culture, civility, family 
cohesion and politics , the overall balance of public sentiment leans positive. But notable minorities 
– ranging from a median of 20% in the case of family cohesion to a median of 29% in the case of 
politics – say mobile phones have had a negative impact on these facets of society.  
Moreover, public opinion across these 11 countries has diverged in recent years when it comes to 
the internet’s impact on politics. Compared with surveys conducted in 2014, larger shares of 
Mexicans, South Africans, Venezuelans, Kenyans and Colombians now say increasing use of the 
internet has had a positive impact on politics. But Tunisians, Lebanese and Jordanians are now 
less likely to say this  compared with 2014.

 Despite wide- ranging worries about the problems mobile phones invite, personal benefits  
are still widely recognized  
In addition to their concerns 
about the impact of mobile 
phones on children , majorities 
across the 11 countries surveyed 
also say people should also be 
very worried about issues such 
as identity theft (an 11 -country 
median of 66% say people 
should be very concerned about 
this), exposure to false 
information (64%), mobile phone addiction (62%)  and 
harassment or bullying (59%)  
when using their mobile 
phones . Fewer are very

 Yet these broader concerns often coexist with 
perceived benefits to users. For instance, d espite 
widespread concerns that mobile phones might 
expose people to false or inaccurate information, 
a sizable majority of mobile phone users (79%) 
say their own phone has helped their ability to 
get news and information about important issues.  Similarly, a median of 58% of mobile 
phone users say their devices have helped  their 
ability to communicate face -to-face – even as a 
median of 48% of adults in these countries say 
people should be very worried about mobile phones’ effects on face -to-face communication.  
Other key findings relating to the adoption 
and use of digital technology in these countries include : 
 Majorities in each  country own their mobile 
phone , and s haring a phone with someone 
else is relatively rare . A median of just 7 % of 
adults in these countries share a mobile 
phone , ranging from a low of 1% of adults in Vietnam to a high of 17% in Venezuela . 
 Smartphone us e is higher among  younger adults and those with high er education levels.5 
Lebanon and Jordan are the only countries in the survey in which a majority of  adults ages 50 
and older –  as well as a majority of those with less than a secondary education –  are 
smartphone users.  
 Home computer and tablet access is relatively rare in these countries: A median of 34% have 
access to either kind of device. And a median of 27% of adults in these countries say they do not have a tablet or computer at home but do have a sm artphone, ranging from a low of 18% in 
Venezuela to a high of 50% in Jordan.  
 By a substantial margin,  Facebook (used by a median of 62 % of adults in these countries) and 
WhatsApp (used by a median of 4 7%) are the two most commonly  used social media or 
mess aging platforms out of the seven included in the survey . To the extent that adults use only 
one of these platform s, in every country that platform is either Facebook or WhatsApp.   
                                                        
5 For the purpose of  comparing education groups across countries, we standardize education levels based on the United Nations’ 
International Standard Classification of Education. In all nations surveyed , the lower education category is below secondary education and the 
higher  category is secondary or above.  Vast majority of users in 11 countries 
say mobile phones help them stay

 1. Use of smartphones and social media is common across 
most emerging economies  
Large majorities in the 11 emerging and developing  countries surveyed either own or share a 
mobile phone , and in every country it is much more common to own one’s own phone than to 
share it with someone else. I n seven of the se countries , half or more now use smartphones – and 
smartphone use is especially common among younger and more educated groups . 
Meanwhi le, access to tablets or computers is rarer. In only one country –  Lebanon – does a 
majority (57%) have access to a working desktop, laptop or tablet computer in their household , 
and mobile devices play a prominent role in how people access the internet an d their social 
networks in many of these nations.6 Additionally, i n most of these countries a majority of adults 
use social media platforms or messaging apps –  with Facebook and WhatsApp showing prominent 
levels of adoption.

 Most adults say they own a mo bile phone; relatively few share one  
Majorities of adults in each of the 11 emerging 
and developing countries surveyed report 
owning their own mobile phone.  Ownership 
level s are highest in Vietnam, where nearly all 
adults (97%) own a mobile device , although  
about nine -in-ten or more also own one  in 
Jordan, Tunisia, Colombia, Kenya, Lebanon 
and South Africa.  Ownership is lowest in 
Venezuela, India and the Philippines, but even 
in these countries about seven -in-ten adults 
own a mobile device.   
Meanwhile, an 11 -country median of 1 1% say 
they do not  own a mobile phone , which 
includes a median of 7 % who say they regularly 
use someone else’s phone.7 But overall, p hone 
sharing is relatively rare in most countries – 
ranging from just 1% in Vietnam to a high of 
17% in V enezuela . (Throughout this report, 
phone owners and phone sharers will be grouped together and referred to as “mobile 
phone users .”) 
Sharing tends to be more common among adults with lower levels of education.
8 And in 
India – where women are less likely th an men 
to own their own mobile phones –  significantly more women (20%) than men (5%) report sharing 
a device with someone else.

 Mobile phone ownership varies by age, gender and education  
Across these 11 countries, mobile phone ownership (as distinct from phone sharing) tends to vary  
by several demographic traits, including educational attainment , gender and age . 
In all countries surveyed, a dults with a secondary education or higher are more likely to own their 
own mobile phone than are those with less than a secondary education. These educational gaps in 
ownership range from just 3 percentage points in Vietnam to 35 points in the Philippines.  
Majorit ies of both men and women own mobile pho nes in all of the countries surveyed . But 
ownership rates among women vary significantly across the countries, from a low of 56% in India 
to a high of 96% in Vietnam. Outside of India  – where men are 28 percentage points  more likely 
than women to own a mob ile phone –  gender gaps in ownership in other countries are either 
relatively modest (such as the 8 -point differences in Kenya and Lebanon) or nonexistent, as in the 
case of Vietnam  and the Philippines.  
Most of those ages 18 to 29  report owning their own m obile phone  in almost all countries 
surveyed . However, a slightly smaller share of younger Venezuelans –  but still a majority at 65% – 
say they own a mobile phone . A majority of those 50 and older also report owning a mobile phone  
in most of the 11 countri es surveyed . Only in the Philippines do fewer than half of the oldest age 
group own a phone (46%) . Overall, y ounger people are more likely than older adults to own a 
phone  in the Philippines (41 percentage point s), Lebanon (27 points), India (25 points) and 
Mexico (24 points).

 Phone users cite multiple reasons for 
sharing, rath er than owning , a mobile 
device  
Across the countries surveyed, the 7% median 
of those who share , rather than own, a mobile 
phone  cite a number of reasons for why they 
share  their phones . About four -in-ten phone  
sharers in Kenya (42%), Venezuela (40%) and 
Tunisia (38%) say they share a phone primarily 
because they cannot afford their own device. Another half of Ve nezuelan sharers say they 
now share a phone because their own phone was lost, broken or stolen, as do  about four -in-
ten Colombians (41%) and Kenyans (41%). Not 
needing to use a mobile phone regularly is a 
common ly cited  reason for sharing a phone in 
India (39%) and the Philippines (29%).  
In India, a sizable portion of phone sharers also name  another reason for sharing rather than 
owning their own device: They think phones are too complicated to use (26%).

 Smartphones are generally the most common type of  mobile device  
Smartphones , or phones that can connect to the internet and run apps,  are the most prevalent type 
of mobile device in nine of the 11 countries surveyed : A majority of adults (median of 5 3%) report 
using a smartphone. Usage  is highest in Leba non (86%) and Jordan (85%), and lowest in India 
(32%).  
  How this survey defines different types of mobile phone users  
Some general features and capabilities can help distinguish between the three broad types of mobile 
phones:  
 
 Basic phones  are generally the most technically limited –  and most affordable –  mobile phone option. 
These phones typically only have the ability to make voice calls or send text messages and cannot 
access the internet or download apps.  
 Feature phones  typically fall between smartphones and basic phones in terms of connectivity and price. 
These devices can access the internet and may offer some of the same features as smartphones, such as the ability to access social media platforms. However, they have fewer advanced capabilities than 
smartphones and typically do not support apps.  
 Smartphones  are the most advanced –  and generally most expensive –  type of mobile phone. These 
devices can connect to the internet, run a variety of apps and offer many of the same capabilities of a traditional computer.  
 
Respondents to this survey were asked a series of questions to determine the type of mobile device they own 
or share with someone else . Those who indicate d that their phone is a smartphone are classified as 
smartphone users. Those who said  their mobile phone can connect to the internet –  but that it is not a 
smartphone – are categorized as feature phone users. And those who said  their phone is not a smartphone 
and cannot access the internet are considered to hav e a basic phone.  Responses to each of these individual 
questions can be found in the topline  and more information on the combined measures can be found in

 Basic  and feature phones are less popular overall, but some countries stand out for their high 
usage of these less digitally  connected phones. I n India nearly half of adults (47%) say they use a 
basic mobile phone that cannot connect to the internet. S izable sh ares in Kenya (40%), Tunisia 
(37%) and Venezuela (36%) also report using a basic phone.  
Across emerging economies , smartphones –  rather than basic or feature phones –

Feature phones are generally the least common devices in the countries surveyed, with few adults 
(median of 4 %) saying  they own or share  a device that can connect to the internet but is not a 
smartphone . But feature phones  – which offer some of the same features as smartphones, but 
typically cannot support apps – are popular in Mexico, where one- third of adults say they use this 
type of device.  About one -in-five Kenyans (21%) and Colombians ( 17%) also use feature phones.  
Smartphone use is far more common among younger and more educated adults  
Younger adults lead the way in smartphone use in each of the countries surveyed. Across all 11 
countries, those under 30 are much more likely to use a sm artphone than those ages 50 and older.  Feature phone  Smartphone

differ substantially by country, from nine -in-ten 
or more in Lebanon, Jordan and Vietnam to 
fewer than half of Kenyans under 30 (46%).  
Lebanon and Jordan – where smartphones are 
widespread  – stand out for being the only 
countries where a major ity of adults ages 50 and 
older also report using smartphones. Still, older 
Lebanese and Jordanian adults are far less likely than their younger counterparts to use  a 
smartphone.

 People with higher levels of education are also 
more likely to use smartphones. In each count ry 
surveyed, a majority of those with a secondary 
education or more use smartphones. The 
education gap is most pronounced in India, 
where more educated people are 41 points more 
likely to use a smartphone.  
In six of these countries, men are somewhat 
more likely than women to use smartphones. 
This gap is largest in India, where 40% of men 
use smartphones compared with 23% of 
women.  
While smartphone users are generally younger and more educated, the opposite is true of basic phone users: People who use these more 
technically limited devices tend to be older and have lower levels of education.  
Feature phone use doesn’t consistently vary by 
age or education. However, in Mexico –  where 
one-third of the population uses a feature

 Facebook  and WhatsApp  are the most widely  used  social  platforms  
Among the seven online social media platforms and messaging apps asked about on this survey, a 
median of 62 % use Facebook . Facebook is most popular in Jordan and Lebanon, where about 
seven -in-ten adults say they currently use it. Although India has the smallest percentage of 
Facebook users (24%) of the countries surveyed, the country also has the largest net number of 
active Facebook users in the world .  
  
The seven social media platforms and messaging apps in this report and why they were 
included  
Respondents w ere asked about their use of seven different social media platforms and messaging apps. 
These platforms were chosen based on three criteria: high usage rates, input from local survey organizations 
and to capture a range of different types of sites with dis tinctive features. The  seven platforms included are:  
 
 Facebook , a social networking platform founded in 2004. As of the release date of this report, i ts 
interface is available in over 100 languages.  
 WhatsApp , a messaging platform launched in 2009. The service allows users to send text messages 
and other media, as well as make phone and video calls. WhatsApp’s interface is available in up to 60 
languages.  
 Twitter , a social networking and microblogging platform founded in 2006. The Twitter interface is 
available in 47 languages.  
 Viber , a messaging and voice over platform founded in 2010. Its interface is available in 39 languages.  
 Instagram , a photo - and video -sharing platform founded in 2010. Instagram’s interface is available in 
up to 36 languages.  
 Snap chat , a multimedia messaging platform founded in 2011. Its interface is available in 22 languages.  
 Tinder , a mobile dating platform founded in 2012. It is available in over 40 languages.  
 For purposes of this report, people who use any one of these seven  social media platforms or messaging 
apps are classified as “social media users.” Responses to each of these individual questions can be found in 
the topline , and more information on the combined measures can be fo und in Appendix B

 The messaging application WhatsApp, which was purchased by Facebook in 2014 , is also one of 
the most widely used digital platforms, with a median of 47% saying they use it. As with Facebook, 
WhatsApp is most popular in Jordan and Lebanon, where about eight -in-ten or more say they 
currently use it. The messaging app is least popular in the Philippines and Vietnam, where very 
few adults use it –  4% and 2%, respectively.  
Use of the other platforms included in the survey is less widespread. A median of 20% say they use the photo -sharing application Instagram –  which is also owned by Facebook
 – while 10% or fewer 
report using Twitter or the messaging and photo -sharing app Snapchat. Just 4% of adults in these 
countries say they use the Viber messaging app, and no more than 3% in any country use the dating app Tinder.  
But s ome platforms are more  popular in particular countries. For example, about one -third of 
Lebanese adults (34%) say they currently use Instagram. The messaging app Viber is most popular 
in Lebanon and Tunisia, where about one -in-five adults report using it. And Jordanians stand o ut 
for their use of the photo -messaging app Snapchat (24%).

 Educational gaps in usage are also significant 
for most of these services, with p eople  who have 
a secondary education or higher being more 
likely to use them. In Vietnam, for example, a 
large majority of more educated adults (85%) 
use Facebook, compared with 52% of those with 
less than a secondary education.  
Majorities of adults in most cou ntries use at 
least one social media platform or

In most of the 11 countries  analyzed , a majority 
of adults report using at least one of the seven 
social media platforms or messaging app s 
included  in this survey . This type of online 
activity is especially common in Lebanon, Jordan, Colombia and Mexico, where about 
three -quarters or more use  at least one of these 
services.  
Kenya and India are the only countries where a majority of adults do  not use at least one of 
these social media  or messaging services.  
Although it is common to use at least one of these platforms, relatively few adults  (median of 20%)  
say they  currently  use three or more  social media platforms or messaging apps. This level of use is 
most common in Lebanon and Jordan, where about four -in-ten say they use three or more of these 
apps  (42% and 38%, respectively) . About three -in-ten say the same  in Venezuela  (31%),  Colombia  
(29%)  and Mexico (27%) . People in India (9%), the Philippines (9%) and Vietnam (5%) are the 
least likely to report using three or more of these apps.

online in the Latin American countries of Mexico (81%), Colombia (80%) and Venezuela 
(77%).  
India has the smallest share of internet users of the countries surveyed: Just 38% of Indians use the internet. However, a ma jority of Indians 
ages 18 to 29 (55%) go online, as do a majority 
of Indians with a secondary degree or more 
(67%).

How this survey defines ‘internet users’  
The definition of an internet user used in this report seeks to capture the many ways in which p eople are 
likely to go online. In addition to asking people directly whether they use the internet, people are also 
classified as internet users if they:  
 
 Use any of the seven major social media or messaging services included in the survey (Facebook, What sApp, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Viber and Tinder).  
 Use a smartphone  or feature phone  that can connect to the internet . 
Responses to each of these individual questions can be found in the topline
, and more information on the 
combined measures can be found in Appendix B . 30 
PEW RESEARCH CENTER  
www.pewresearch .org 
 Similar  patterns regarding age and education 
are found in the other 10 countries surveyed : 
Younger and more educated people are more 
likely to go online.  
In eight of these countries , gender differences 
in internet use are either nonexistent  (in the 
case of Colombia, the Philippines, Venezuela 
and Vietnam)  or modest ( in the case of Jordan, 
Lebanon, Mexico and South Africa) . These 
differences are most prominent in India , Kenya  
and Tunisia , although majorit ies of both men 
and women in Tunisia and Kenya go online . In 
India, 46% of men and just 29% of women use 
the internet. To s ome extent, these gender gaps 
in internet use coincide with differences in 
smartphone use, as men in both countries are 
more likely to use smartphones than women.  
For more on how use of the internet and of 
specific social media platforms and messaging 
apps vary by age, gender or education, see

 Home computer or tablet access is relati vely rare in most countries  
In most  of the  countries  surveyed , relatively  few 
people (median of 34%) have access to a 
desktop computer, laptop or tablet in their 
household . The exception is Lebanon, where a 
majority of adults (57%) say they have access to 
such a device.  As with most other measures of 
technological connectedness , those who are 
younger and more educated are generally more 
likely to have access t o a computer or tablet at

 2. Majorities say mobile phones are good for society, even 
amid concerns about their impact on children  
Across the 11 countries surveyed, people’s attitudes toward mobile phones tend to be largely 
positive. In most of the countries, a large  majorit y say mobile phones have been good for them 
personally , and many also say mobile phones positive ly impact education and the economy . 
Mobile phone users also overwhelmingly agree that their phone s help them to stay in t ouch with 
faraway friends and family and keep them informed of the latest news and information.   
At the same time, people’s positive attitudes are paired with concerns about the impact of mobile phones on certain aspects of society –  
and especially their impact on children. In 
eight of these countries, a majority of the public says that the increasing  use of mobile 
phones has had a bad impact on children today. And w hen asked about the potential risks of mobile phone use, majorities in every country 
say people should be very concerned that mobile phones might expose children to harmful or 
inappropriate  content.

world like a global village.”

 Overwhelming majorities say mobile phones have been more positive 
than negative for them personally  
In nine of the 11 countries surveyed, large 
majorities say mobile phones have been mostly 
good for them personally. I n Venezuela , people 
are more skeptical of the role mobile phones are 
playing in their lives . There, 49% say mobile 
phones have been mostly good for them 
personally, while 47% say they have been mostly 
bad. Elsewhere, no more than 11% in any 
country say mobile phones have been mostly a 
bad thing for them.  
In nine of these 11 countries, majorities al so say 
mobile phones have had a positive impact on society . But in most countries, people report less 
enthusiasm  about the societal impact of mobile 
devices than about the ir personal impact.  For 
example, while 82% of Jordanians say mobile 
phones have mostl y been good for them 
personally, just 53% express positive views about 
their societal impact. And in Colombia, Tunisia 
and Mexico, there is at least a 10- percentage-
point difference between shares who see the 
personal benefits of mobile phones and those 
who see the society -wide benefits.  
Regardless of the type of mobile phone people use – basic, feature or smart – most have similar 
views about how their lives and societies have 
been impacted by their devices.
9 Across all surveyed countries, basic or feature phone users are 
just as likely as smartphone users in their country to say mobile phones have mostly been a 
positive thing for them personally. And in all countries but Mexico, similar shares of smartphone 
users and those with less advanced devices say the societal impact of mobile phones has mostly 
been good. In Mexico, where smartphone use is relatively low compared with  other countries ,

 smartphone users are somewhat more likely than basic or feature phone users to say the impact on 
society has been mostly positive (77% vs. 69%).   
But there are some differences between mobile phone users and those who do not use a mobile phone  at all . In five of these 11 countries (India, Kenya, Lebanon, Mexico and South Africa) , 
mobile users  of any kind are more likely than non- users to say that mobile devices have had a 
mostly positive impact on society.  
Mobile  phone  users have mixed views about upsides and downsides of 
their phones , are espe cially divided over whether they ‘couldn’t live 
without ’ phones   
In every country surveyed,  mobile phone users 
are more likely to say their phone is something 
that frees them rather than  something that ties 
them down. A t least 63% in five countries 
(Kenya,  Vietnam, Venezuela, South Africa and 
the Philippines) characterize their phone as 
something that frees them, whereas users in other countries are somewhat more ambivalent. For example, while 46% of Jordanian mobile phone users say their phone frees them, 25% say it ties 
them down, and 21% volunteer that neither statement holds true. I n Lebanon, 40% of mobile 
phone users say their phone frees them, compared with 30% who say it ties them down.  
Across the 11 countries surveyed, m obile phone users are somewha t more divided when it comes to 
whether their phone helps save them time or makes them waste time. In seven countries, larger 
shares say  their phone helps save them time. Kenyans are especially likely to see their phone as a 
time saver; 8 4% of mobile phone  users say their phone saves them time, compared with 1 4% who 
say it wastes their time. Venezuelan (71%), South African (65%), Indian (64%), Vietnamese (63%),  
Tunisian (54%) and Colombian (50%) phone users are also more likely to say that phones save 
them time rather than waste it. But mobile phone users in Jordan and the Philippines generally 
believe they waste more time on their phones than they save, while Mexican and Lebanese phone 
users are roughly evenly divided in their assessments.  
Mobile phone  users are even more divided when assessing their reliance or lack thereof on their 
mobile device. In six countries – Mexico, Colombia, India, the Philippines, Venezuela and Vietna m 
– around half or more see their phone as something they don’t always need . But  in five others  – 
Jordan, Lebanon, South Africa, Tunisia and Kenya  – users are more inclined to say they  couldn’t 
live without it.   “It’s like the mobile phones become your 
partner.”  
-Woman , 40, Philippines  36

In some instances , people’s perceptions of the necessity of their mobile device is not linked to their 
assessments of its  utility in other aspects of their life . For instance, a majority of Venezuela ns say 
their phone is something that frees them and helps them save time –  but just 29% say they 
couldn’t live without it. Conversely , a majority of Jordanians say they couldn’t live without their 
phone – even as they are more likely to describe it as a time waster rather than a time saver.  
 
Consistently, smartphone users tend to be somewhat more critical of their device than basic or 
feature phone users in their country. For exam ple, in every country smartphone users are more 
likely than basic or feature phone users to say the ir phone makes them waste time . And in all 
countries except Lebanon, smartphone users are more likely to say their phone ties them down 
rather than frees the m.   
There are also prominent and consistent differences by age. In every country surveyed, mobile 
phone users ages  50 and older are significantly more likely than users ages 18 to 29 to believe their 
phone helps them save time. The age gap is particularly notable in Vietnam, Tunisia and Mobile phone users divided over whether their phone is something they ‘don’t 
always need ’ or ‘couldn’t live without ’

 When asked about a variety of ways in  which 
mobile phones might affec t their day -to-day 
lives, users across the surveyed countries 
generally agree that mobile phones have 
mostly helped them keep in touch with people 
who live far away and obtain information 
about important issues. But there is  less 
consensus  when it comes to mobile phones’ 
impact on people’s ability to earn a living, concentrate and get things done , or communicate face -
to-face.  
Large majorities say their phones have mostly helped them stay in touch with people who live far 
away. A median of 93% across the 11 countries surveyed express this view, whereas a median of just 1% say mobile phones have hurt their ability to stay in touch. M ajorities also say their mobile 
phones have helped them obtain information and news about important issues, ranging from a low of 73% in Vietnam to a high of 88% in Kenya. And only small shares (from 1% to 6% of users) indicate that phones have hurt their ab ility to do this.  
In all 11 countries, smartphone users are significantly more likely than basic or feature phone 
users to say their phone has helped them obtain news and information. The difference is 
particularly prominent in Lebanon,  where 8 3% of smartp hone users say the impact has been 
positive, compared with 26% of non -smartphone users. And in Jordan, smartphone users are 
much more likely than non- smartphone users to say their phone has mostly helped them obtain 
information (8 3% vs. 44%).  
Less consensu s over whether mobile phones help users earn a living, concentrate or 
communicate face -to-face  
Across the 11 countries surveyed, there is less agreement about whether mobile phones have 
helped people earn a living. Majorities of users in nine countries say  their phone has had a positive 
impact on their livelihood –  ranging from 55% in Tunisia to 81% in Kenya –  while Jordanians and 
Lebanese most commonly say that mobile phones have not had much impact either way on their ability to make a living. Still, few people see mobile phones having a negative effect. E ven in 
Jordan and Lebanon, nearly four -in-ten say the impact has been favorable.  
There is less consensus among mobile phone users that their devices have helped them to 
concentrate and get things done. Ma jorities in eight out of 11  countries say mobile phones have “In general terms, communication is much 
more efficient. You are more 
interconnected, [whether] with your 
relatives or with world affairs.”

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

 mostly helped them concentrate and get things done. But notable shares in the Philippines (30%), 
Lebanon (18%) and India (16%) say mobile phones negatively affect their concentration.  
In some ins tances, these attitudes are related to  the type of device users carry  – although this 
relationship varies by country. Smartphone users in five out of 11 countries  – Lebanon, India, 
Jordan, Colombia and Venezuela – are more likely than other phone users to say their phone helps 
them concentrate and get things done, while there are no differences based on smartphone usage 
in the other six countries surveyed. This pattern is particularly salient in Lebanon, Jordan and 
India , where smartphone users and non -smar tphone users differ by at least 10 percentage points.  
These findings echo the concerns raised by 
some focus gro up participants  (see Appendix A  
for more information on how the groups were 
conducted) . Some respondents noted how 
mobile phones bring distractions and shorten 
their attention spans, leading people to commit 
basic errors or not complete work  because of the attention paid to their devices. In every group 
held in the Philippines, for example, at least one participant brought up that she had burned the rice she was making because of her focus on her phone.  
Lastly, majorities of users in eight c ountries say their mobile phones have helped their ability to 
communicate face -to-face – but notable shares in many countries say that impact has been mostly 
negative. In particular, 35% of Lebanese phone users say mobile phones have hurt their ability to 
communicate face -to-face.  
 In focus groups, some lamented that more and 
more people prefer virtual communication 
enabled by mobile phones and other 
technologies to face -to-face interaction. A few 
participants across the four countries where 
focus groups were conducted also pointed o ut 
similar trends among children and young 
people.  
Because these questions center on people’s personal relationship with their device, they were only asked of those who own or regularly share a mobile phone. For those who reported not using a 
phone at all , a different set of questions were posed: How do mobile phones, in general, shape 
people’s ability to stay in touch with those far away, to obtain information, and so on? Broadly , “Because I was busy texting my client, my 
rice got overcooked.”

people use telephones to express 
themselves to avoid face -to-face 
discussions.”

PEW RESEARCH CENTER  
www.pewresearch .org 
 non- users’  impressions of the impact of mobile phones tend to mirror the ways users feel about 
their own devices. The vast majority of non -users feel that mobile phones help people stay in touch 
with those who live far away, but smaller shares think  they help people  to concentrate and get 
things done or communicate face -to-face.  
Majorities in most countries say mobile phone use has had a good impact 
on education, but few er see positive impacts on children, health, morality  
Publics in the  11 nations polled  view mobile  phones as having a range of positive and negative 
consequences when it comes to their broader impact on their country and its society . Most 
notably, a median of 67% –  and around half or more in every country –  say the increased use of 
mobile phones has ha d a good influence on education. Slightly smaller majorities say the increased 
use of mobile phones has had a good influence on the economy (58%) as well as on their local 
culture  (56%) . 
Despite positive views of mobile phones’ impact on education and the economy, 
many fewer think they have had a good impact on children , physical health, morality

www.pewresearch .org Few in these countries say mobile phones have had a good impact on children today  
Across all dimensions measured in the survey, publics in the 11 coun tries  are most negative about 
the impact of mobile phones on children. Nowhere does a majority feel that mobile phones have 
had a good influence on children. And in eight countries , majorit ies of the population  say that 
mobile phones have had a bad influence on children today. Residents of the three Middle East and 
North African ( MENA ) countries surveyed are especially downbeat about mobile phones in this 
regard: 90% of Jordanians, 86% of Lebanese and 81% of Tunisians say mobile phones have had a bad influence on children in their country.   
People also focus on  the negative impact s of mobile phones on physical health , morality  
 In addition to the impact of mobile phones on children, health and morality stand out as 
particular areas of concern. A median of 40% – and clear majorities in Lebanon (71%), Jordan 
(69%) and Tunisia (63%) – say the increasing 
use of mobile phones ha s had a bad influence 
on people’s physical health. Some focus group participants expressed similar sentiment by commenting that excessive screen time, phone 
“addiction” and lack of physical activities were 
potential health -related challenges.  
Meanwhile, a media n of 34% say mobile phones have had a positive impact on morality, similar to 
the share who say the impact has been negative. As was the case wit h children and health, 
Lebanese, Jordanians and Tunisians hold the most unfavorable views in this regard. R ough ly a 
third or more in Colombia, Mexico, Kenya  and South Af rica also say mobile phones negatively 
affect people’s morality.  
 As noted above, publics in Lebanon, Jordan and Tunisia stand out in their overall negativity 
toward mobile phones on these aspects of society. But other countries are conspicuous for having relatively positive attitudes in this regard. Kenyans, in particul ar, offer especially upbeat 
assessments of mobile phones. Half or more Kenyans feel that mobile phones have had a positive impact on each of these aspects of 
society, with the exception of children today 
(just 28% of Kenyans say mobile phones have 
been goo d for children). South Africans and 
Filipinos are also relatively positive about most areas surveyed.  “Phones also give us much more room to 
conceal things.”

 In most countries, t here are no differences between smartphone users and non -users – nor 
between social media users and non- users – when it comes to people’s views about the impact of 
increasing mobile phone use on children.  But on other questions there is more variation between 
users and non- users. For instance, i n six out of 11 countries larger share s of social media users 
than non- users say the increasing use of mobile phones has had a good influence on their nation’s 
politics. This includes all  three MENA  countries in the survey . Conversely, in eight of these 11 
countries larger share s of social media users than non- users say mobile phones have had a bad 
influence on family cohesion.  
Concern is widespread  about the 
risk that mobile phones might 
expose children to immoral or 
harmful content  
Despite the perceived benefits of increased 
mobile adoption  in areas such as education, 
public s express concern about  an array of  
potential downsides of mobile phone use . The 
survey a sked about six possible risks from 
mobile phone use , and respondents in every 
country are most concerned about children being exposed to immoral or harmful content. A 
median of 79 % – including a majority in each 
country  surveyed – feel people should be ver y 
concerned about this.  
Meanwhile, the prospect of users losing the ir 
ability to communicate face -to-face is the item of 
least concern in each country. In only two 
countries (South Africa and Colombia) are a 
majority of adults very concerned about 
declinin g face -to-face communication skills  as a 
result of mobile phone usage .  
Among these 11 countries, Colombians rank in 
the top two most -concerned about all of these 
issues . Other countries that rank in the top two 
most -concerned on particular issues include : Majorities  are very concerned about 
children being exposed to harmful

 Mexico (identity theft and online harassment); Jordan ( phone addiction and  impacts on children); 
South Africa (exposure to false information and losing the ability to talk face -to-face); and Tunisia 
(phone addiction).  
 
Beyond these country -specific differences, concerns about mobile phone use exhibit few  consistent 
or substantial differences relating to gender, age, phone type or social media usage.  Notably, 
concerns about children  are widespread across multiple groups. In most instances, men and 
women, older and younger adults, and social media users and non- users express similar levels of 
concern about the impact of inappropriate online content  on children.  People in most countries  are very  concerned about a broad range of potential

 Additionally, men and women in most of these countries are similarly concerned about 
harassment and bullying  – a noteworthy contrast to the gender -related differences often seen in 
surveys of online harassment  among Americans . For example, a 2017 Pew Research Center  survey  
found that 70% of women in the U.S. said  online harassment was a “major pro blem,” compared 
with 54% of men.  
It is relatively common for mobile 
phone users to limit the amount of 
time they –  as well as their children  – 
spend on their phones

various types of screens on children  and adults  
alike, m ajorities of mobile phone users in five  of 
these 11 countries say they have ever tried to 
limit the time they themselves  spend on their 
phone. This behavior is especially common in 
the Philippines and Mexico , but somewhat less 
prevalent among mob ile phone owners in 
Jordan, Lebanon, Venezuela and Vietnam .  
In all 11 countries surveyed, smartphone users 
are more likely than n on-smartphone users to 
say they try to limit the time they spend on their 
mobile phone. These differences are especially 
prominent in Vietnam (where 46% of 
smartphone users and 24% of non- smartphone 
users have done this) and Colombia (66% vs. 
45%). And in 10 of these countries, larger share s 
of mobile phone users who also use social media 
say they have tried to limit the ir phone use 
relative to those who do not use social media.  Parents  at times try to limit their 
children’s screen time , and many try to 
limit their own time on the p hone

 People’s efforts to limit screen time also extend to children. Among parents wh ose child  has access 
to a mobile phone, about half or more  in seven  of these countries say they ever set limits on how 
much time their child  can spend on their phone.10  
As was true of limiting their own screen time, parents’ efforts to limit the time their child spends 
on his or her phone also differ by the type of phone they themselves own .11 Smartphone -owning 
parents whose child also uses  a mobile phone are more likely than parents with more basic phones 
to say they have tried to limit their child’s screen time in nine of these 11 countries. Indeed, this 
gap reaches double digits in nine  of these 11  countries – and is as high as 22 points in Vietnam  and 
Jordan . 
Parents’ efforts to limit their child’s mobile phone use are also related to their concerns about the 
negative impacts of mobile phone use (such as online harassment or children being exposed to 
immoral content). In nearly every country surveyed, parents who say they are very concerned 
about at least five of the six issues tested are more likely to try to limit their child’s mobile phone 
use relative to those who are very concerned about two or fewer of these issues. The only exception 
to this trend is Jordan, where similar shares of highly  concerned and less -concerned parents say 
they try to limi t their child’s mobile phone use.

 It is common for parents to monitor their child’s mobile phone use, and 
notable shares monitor the phone activity  of their spouse or partner  
In the focus group interviews conducted as part 
of this study, mobile phone surveillance 
performed by immediate family members 
emerged as a common theme. Some parents mentioned that mobile phones allowed them to 
track the whereabouts of their children and to 
make sure they were not exposed to harmful 
content. And for people in marriages or romantic 
relationships, mobile phone “spying” and social 
media “stalking” sometimes become the source of drama, jealousy and harassment.  
Among parents whose child  or chi ldren  use a 
mobile phone, a median of 50% say they ever 
monitor what their child is looking at or doing 
on the screen. But some variation exists  across 
these countries. In Jordan, Colombia and 
Mexico, for example, clear majorities of parents 
do this, compa red with 37% of parents in 
Vietnam and 38% in India.  
Parents who use a smartphone are generally more likely to say they monitor their child’s 
phone usage than parents who use a basic or 
feature phone. This trend is seen in 10  out of the 
11 countries and is especially prominent in 
Jordan and Vietnam , where smartphone users 
differ from other phone users by 30 percentage 
points each.  
Parents’ likelihood of monitoring their child’s phone use also differs by their own social media 
presence. Parents who use soci al media and messaging apps in each country are more likely than 
parents who do not use social media platforms to say they monitor content on their child’s phone.  It is more common to monitor a child's 
phone use than to monitor a partner’s

looking at  or doing on their mobile phone  
 
Note: Only respondents whose spouse/partner or whose child uses 
a mobile phone are shown. In the survey, questions about parents 
and children (as well as spouses or partners) were asked of all 
respondents. The results reported here were recalculated to exclude 
those who volunteered that they do not have any children  (or a 
spouse/partner) , and/or that their child or children (or 
spouse/partner) do not have a mobile phone.  Respondents who 
gave other responses are not shown.

 Monitoring of mobile phone activity also extends to marriages and romantic relationships  
In all countries surveyed, it is less common to 
monitor a partner’s phone activity  – although 
notable shares of those with a spouse or 
partner report doing so .12 Among those whose 
partner or spouse uses a mobile phone, a 
median of 2 6% say they ever monitor their 
partner’s phone use. In the Philippines, this 
behavior is somewhat more common; 38% say 
they monitor their partner’s phone.  
In most countries surveyed, younger adults are 
more likely to monitor their partner’s phone 
than older adults in their country. This trend 
holds even after accounting for the fact that 
younger adults are generally more likely than older adults to use smartphone s or social 
media. In 10 countries, smartphone users ages 
18 to 29 are more likely to say they monitor their partner’s phone activity than smartphone 
users ages 50 and older.  
There are also notable gender differences when it comes to monitoring the phone activity  of their significant other. In five of these  11 countries 
(Jordan, Venezuela, Vietnam, Mexico and Tunisia), larger shares of women than men say they ever 
monitor what their partner does on the phone. India is the only country surveyed where men are 
more l ikely than women to say they keep an eye on their partner’s phone.

 3. People say the internet brings economic and educational 
benefits  – but some are concerned about social media’s 
societal impact  
Whereas t he previous chapter looked specifically at mobile phones and their perceived impact , this 
chapter focuses on the perceived changes brought about by increasing internet and social media 
use. Majorit ies of the public in every country surveyed feel the internet is having a positive 
influence on education, and these assessments are often more positive than they were four years 
ago. In the three Middle Eas t and North African countries surveyed , people are more pessimistic 
about the internet’s influence on politics than they were four years ago . And publics are also 
skeptical about the effect the internet is having on their children . 
Generally, people in mos t countries think 
mobile phones and the internet have had 
similar impacts on society –  whether for good 
or for bad. And , although pluralities in most 
countries say social media have  been a good 
thing for society, large minorities see downsides 
as well  – a sentiment that is even more 
common among those who do not use social media . 
 
 “Things have gotten better indeed, but 
[the mobile phone] also has made us 
lazier. For the busier ones, it has helped us 
have everything more within our reach, 
but there are other times in which this can 
become counterproductive. Relationships 
become blurrier. You hardly ever see the 
other person. It’s become  shallow and 
everything comes down to what you post 
on Facebook or on Twitter.”

 Publics largely see comparable influence s from mobile phones and the 
internet  
In addition to asking respondents how they think mobile phones have impacted society , the survey 
asked an identical series of questions about the influence of the internet. By and large, p ublics feel 
similarly about the influence of mobile phones and the influence of the intern et. Roughly equal 
shares within most countries say mobile phones and the internet have had a good influence on 
morality, politics, physical health, local culture, civility and the economy.  As was the case with 
mobile phones, many publics in these countries  are especially concerned about the influence th e 
internet has had on children.  
 
Internet users and non- users have fairly similar views on how internet use has impacted many 
aspects of their societies. But users are somewhat more upbeat than non- users abou t the internet’s 
influence on politics a nd the economy.  
 Few say increasing internet use has had a positive impact on children; more see 
benefits for economy  and education

 But when it comes to the influence these 
technologies are having on education,  many 
publics do see the influence of the internet and 
that of mobile phones in different lights . In six 
of the 11 countries surveyed, more people say 
the increasing us e of the internet is having a 
good influence on education than say mobile 
phones are having a good influence on 
education. Focus groups in four of the countries 
surveyed revealed some of this tension (see 
Appendix A  for more information on how the 
groups were conducted ). Whereas some focus 
group participants cited the educational 
benefits that stem from children using the 
internet to do their homework or research, 
others highlighted phone addiction, games and 
other distractions as things that hinder studies.  
In five countries,  people differ in their views of 
the impact of mobile phones and the internet 
on family cohesion. Where these differences 
exist, m ore say mobile phones have had a good 
influence on family cohesion than feel the same 
about the internet.

ciety. Venezuelans are generally more likely to say the internet has had positive influence s on 
many facets of society, while Kenyans are more likely to say mobile phone s have had a positive 
impact.  
Views of the impact of the internet have shifted in recent years as usage 
has become more prevalent  
Internet use has generally risen substantially si nce 2014,  when Pew Research Center last asked 
people in t hese emerging ec onomies a bout t he internet’ s influence o n key fa cets o f their societies .13 
With thes e changes , opinions about the positive a nd n egative i mpacts of the internet in many 
countrie s have a lso s hifted . In general, over t ime – and as more p eople h ave gone o nline – views of 
the i nternet’s influence o n society have often grown m ore p ositive, e specially w hen i t comes to 
assessments o f its influence o n the economy and education.     
More now say the internet has had a good  influence on their country’s economy, education  
In many countries, p eople’s v iews of the 
internet’s influence on the economy and 
education have generally improved in the past 
four years. In seven of the 10  countries for 
which  trends are available, more pe ople today 
say the increasing use of the internet has had a 
good influence on their country’s economy than said the same in 2014. And in six countries, 
more say the internet’s influence on education 
is positive compared with  four years ago . 
Publics in Leba non, Kenya, South Africa, Mexico and Vietnam have grown more positive about the 
internet’s influence in both areas. Lebanese views of the internet’s influence on education have shifted especially strongly : In 2014, just one -in-five felt the internet was having a good impact on 
the economy, but today the share has roughly doubled to 42%. Jordanians have also become much more positive about the internet’s influence on education: 71% feel it is having a good influence on education toda y, compared with  less than half (44%) four years earlier .  
13 In the spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, internet users were defined as those who reported using the internet at least occasionally or 
who owned a smartphone. To provide comparable estimates of internet users’ views in 2018, we are using the same definition he re. “For me, WhatsApp is important because 
I have many groups. For instance, I have 
maybe 15 salespeople, so I don’t have to 
call [them] one by one – I just send one 
message.”

PEW RESEARCH CENTER

 Rising internet use overall 
appear s to play some role in 
many publics’ increasing ly 
positive assessments of the internet’s impact on the 
economy and education: 
Internet users in some countries are more likely to see the 
internet’s impact in a positive 
light . But rising internet 
adoption is only part of the 
story. For instance, m ore South 
Africans have access to the 
internet today than did in 2014, 
but views of the internet’s 
influence on the economy 
impr oved among internet users  
over the same period as well. Four years ago, 56% of South 
African internet users felt the 
internet was having a good 
influence on the economy, and 
today, 66% feel it does. I n 
Tunisia , too, internet use has become more widespread since 2014 . Yet  opinions there about the 
internet’s influence on their economy and education have actually grown more negative . 
In other instances, changes in public sentiment have been driven largely by non- internet users. 
For example, i n 2014 , 71% of Kenyan internet users felt the internet was having a good influence 
on the economy , while a similar portion (67%)  say the same today. But among Kenyans who do not 
use the internet or own a smartphone, views have improved , from 50% expressing optimism about 
the internet’s influence on the economy in 2014 to 61% saying the same today.

 In some countries, views of 
the internet’s influence on 
morality and politics have 
grown more positive –  but in 
others, these views have 
grown more negative  
While many of these publics 
have generally  grown more 
positive about the internet’s 
influence on the economy and education  in recent years , fewer 
have grown more positive about its impact on morality and politics. Colombians, 
Kenyans, Venezuelans and

about the internet’s impact on 
morality and politics. But 
Jordanian and Lebanese adults 
have grown more pessimistic  
over the same time period.   
The greatest change in public opinion on these questions has occurred in Jordan, where the 
public is much more pessimistic than it was 
four years ago. In 2014, about a third of Jordanians said the internet was having a good

 Social media user s see more societal benefits from the platforms than non -users  
Users of social media platforms and messaging 
apps  are often more likely than non -users to 
view these platforms as having a good impact 
on society as a whole. These differences are 
especially notable in Lebanon, India and 
Jordan , where there is a difference of more than 
20 percentage points in the shares of social 
media users and non- users who say these 
platforms have been beneficial for society . By 
contrast, users and non -users in Venezuela, the 
Philippines and Vietnam tend to see the social 
impact of these platforms in similar terms.  
These differences between user s and non- users 
tend to exist across all age groups and 
education levels. But in some countries, such as 
Mexico, Tunisia and Lebanon, younger and 
more highly  educated social media users are 
more likely to feel positive about social media’s 
societal effects  than older or less- educated 
users.  
For instance, i n Mexico, two -thirds of 18 - to 29-
year -old users feel that social media ha ve 
mostly been a good thing for society , compared 
with  about half of social media users ages 50 
and above. There is a similar 10 -point gap on 
this question between Mexican social media users with a secondary education or more 
(66%) and users with less than a secondary 
education (56%).

 Appendix A: About the focus groups  
Pew Research Center conducted a series of focus groups to better understand how people think 
about their own mobile phones and the impact of these devices on their society. Five focus groups 
were held in each of the following four countries: Kenya, Mexico,  the Philippines and Tunisia.14 
Each focus group consisted of 10 adults coming together for an hour and a half for a discussion led 
by a local, professional moderator using a guide developed by Pew Research Center.  
In each country, the groups were structured according to the following criteria: 
 Group 1, “basic phone” – all participants either owned or shared a basic phone that could not 
connect to the internet and were 36 years old or older;  
 Group 2, “younger, smartphone” –  all participants owned or shared  a smartphone and were 
under the age of 30;  
 Group 3, “older, smartphone” – all participants owned or shared a smartphone and were at 
least 30 years old;  
 Group 4, “women phone users” –  all participants were women who  either owned or shared a 
phone (including a minimum of five participants who owned or shared a smartphone), and at 
least two participants were married and two were unmarried;  
 Group 5, “migrant phone users” –  all participants either owned or shared a phone (including a 
minimum of five participant s who owned or shared a smartphone) and all either lived in a 
place that was different from where they grew up or had a family member who lived elsewhere.  
All focus groups also required participants to have at least some interest in politics, and, aside from group 4, which was all women , they were balanced with regard to gender. Aside from group 
1, participants were also required to use their phone at least once a week. Where feasible, participants were also recruited to ensure diversity with regard to education levels, employment status, rural and urban location, and the duration for which they have owned their phones.  
                                                        
14 Focus groups were held in four, rather than all 11 countries, because of time and resources. Countries were chosen purposefully to cover 
all four key regions included in the survey: Latin America, the Asia -Pacific, sub -Saharan Africa and the Middle East and Nort h Africa (MENA).  59 
PEW RESEARCH CENTER  
 
 Focus groups were held in the following locations and on the following dates: 
 Mexico City, Mexico: March 13 -15, 2018  
 Manila, Philippines: March 21 -23, 2018  
 Nairobi, Kenya: March 26 -28, 2018  
 Tunis, Tunisia: March 28 -30, 2018  
D3 Systems,  Inc. worked with local field partners in each of the four countries to recruit the 
participants using a screener designed by Pew Research Center. All participants were given 
financial remuneration for their time.  
These groups were primarily used to help shape the survey questions asked in each of the 11 countries. But, throughout the report, we have also included quotations that illustrate some of the 
major themes that were discussed during the groups. Quotations are chosen to provide context for  
the survey findings and are not necessarily representative of the majority opinion in any particular 
group or country. Quotations may have been edited for gramma r and  clarity.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Children’s lives are increasingly mediated by digital technologies, yet our knowledge of how this affects 
their well-being is far from comprehensive. We know, for example, that the online environment 
exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information. The use of digital technologies 
can expand their opportunities, reduce inequalities and contribute to the realization of children’s rights. 
We also know that when children seek information online and want to learn, they risk being exposed to 
inappropriate or potentially harmful content. Yet, when it comes to determining the long-term effects of 
internet use and online experiences on children’s well-being, mental health or resilience, the best we 
can do is make an educated guess.
This is just one evidence gap among many that need to be filled in order that society can support 
children’s positive use of digital technologies, develop children’s skills and protect those who are 
vulnerable. Filling these gaps would benefit children. Their education, relationships, entertainment, and 
participation in a connected world increasingly depend on digital technologies. Filling these gaps 
would also help to guide policy and programme responses and maximize the potential of technological 
advancements. Our need for this knowledge has become even more acute as internet use rises during 
the global COVID-19 pandemic. 
This report identifies, evaluates and synthesizes what has been learned from the most recent research 
about children’s experiences and outcomes relating to the internet and digital technologies. It aims to 
inform policymakers, educators, child protection specialists, industry and parents on the latest and best 
evidence, and it proposes a future research agenda. 
The conceptual framework for the report is based on the well-established models of children’s internet 
use that underpin research by three international projects: EU Kids Online,1 Global Kids Online2 and 
Disrupting Harm.3 We add to this in two ways. First, we pay particular attention to research on children’s 
sexual experiences and related risks online. We do this because of the growing concern about the 
potential for harm online and because it reflects the priorities of the UNICEF Office of Research — 
Innocenti, which funded this research as part of the Disrupting Harm project. Second, we examine 
research on children’s privacy in the digital environment, because of its importance to children’s online 
opportunities, risks and rights.
The methodology is a rapid evidence review of two of the largest databases of peer-reviewed outputs 
in science, technology, medicine, social sciences, and the arts and humanities: Web of Science and 
Scopus . We searched for all empirical studies concerned with digital technology and children published 
since 2016. We then screened the 2,090 search results for relevance and methodological robustness. The 
resulting 359 studies were coded using a version of the Global Kids Online framework. We grouped our 
findings under seven research themes: (1) access; (2) activities and opportunities; (3) digital skills; (4) 
privacy online; (5) risk of harm online; (6) sexual activities and risks online; and (7) mental health and 
well-being.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Four overarching questions guided our review and helped us to identify the key evidence gaps:
  What is the most recent evidence on how children’s internet use contributes positively to child 
outcomes and well-being?
  What is the most recent evidence on how children’s internet use can amplify the risk of harm and 
potentially undermine their well-being?
  How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability, and the protective factors that help to 
build resilience in children?
  What are the remaining research gaps?
Below, we summarize the findings in relation to these questions.
What do we know about how children’s internet use can contribute positively to child 
outcomes and well-being?
Children around the world primarily use mobile devices to access the internet for information and 
entertainment, to connect with their friends and to engage with their community. Increased 
internet and device uptake by society diminishes the gaps in internet access experienced by 
different groups of children. In low-access contexts, children lead the way in the adoption of new 
technologies and are online more than adults.  
Some children experience the benefits more strongly than others. Children from global South countries 
and poorer backgrounds face significant inequalities in relation to access to devices and the internet, 
the quality and cost of connectivity, and the availability of competent support from those around them. 
Such inequalities create a domino effect in other areas, resulting in cross-country inequalities in online 
activities and digital skills. 
The online environment exposes children to new ideas and more diverse sources of information. This 
helps children to engage with others and become aware of different views. The internet is also an 
important source of physical and mental health knowledge for children. They value that it offers 
anonymity, access to reliable information, peer experiences and support-seeking options. 
The internet can have a positive effect on mental health and well-being. Children who receive mental 
health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have improved 
outcomes.
What happens to children offline affects their experiences and outcomes online. Their age, gender, 
home context and relationships with family, peers and school are all important factors. So too are such 
factors as the safety of their neighbourhood or whether they are overweight, engage in substance 
abuse, take sexual risks or are a survivor of violence or sexual abuse. 
How can children’s internet use amplify the risk of harm and potentially undermine their 
well-being?
What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they spend 
online. The more children use the internet, the more skills they develop and the more activities they can 
undertake. But as they engage in a wider range of online activities, children are also more likely to 8
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 encounter risks. However, greater exposure to risk does not necessarily translate into more harm. 
Children can be exposed to inappropriate or potentially harmful content when they are seeking 
information online. For example, some children view sexual content online to learn about sex, but this 
content can expose them to sexually violent behaviours or gender-based sexual objectification. 
Exposure to online risks may result in harm to the child. Some studies show a positive association 
between internet use, risk encounters and negative outcomes. These outcomes include anxiety, 
depression, suicidal thoughts and panic disorder. 
Many studies show that cyber-bullying victimization is associated with lower psychological well-being 
and externalizing behaviours such as feeling angry or ‘acting out’. More children are bystanders of 
cyber-bullying than they are bullies or victims. This experience can have an adverse effect on children’s 
well-being over time. ‘Cyber-bystanders’ display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of 
responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school. 
What do we know about the pathways to harm and vulnerability?
Children who are vulnerable offline are also more likely to be vulnerable online, while protective 
offline factors can also reduce exposure to online risks. Offline factors that create vulnerability or 
protection influence how children engage with the online environment. Vulnerable children, or 
those living with offline risks or disadvantage, are more exposed to online risks and, in turn, find 
themselves more likely to experience harm and less able to find support.
Children’s overall well-being seems to affect how they engage with the internet. For example, a 
lower level of happiness and life satisfaction is found to be associated with exposure to negative 
online content, cyber-hate, discrimination and violent extremism, but we do not know enough 
about why this is the case. Children who experience violence, neglect, physical punishment, 
psychological victimization, parental conflict, sexual harassment and offline solicitation are more 
likely to also be exposed to sexual solicitation online, but again it is unclear exactly how or why 
this happens.
Some children are more vulnerable than others, but who is vulnerable varies based on the type of 
online risk. For example, older teenagers, LGBTQI4 children and those from lower socio-economic 
backgrounds are more likely to engage in ‘sexting’ behaviour and be victims of ‘sextortion’.5 Girls 
are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation coercive sexting, and cyber-dating 
violence. They are also more likely to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers, and to have 
negative sexting experiences, and are more negatively affected by cyber-dating violence. 
Children who experience one kind of online risk are also more likely to experience others. For 
example, online sexual solicitation is associated with exposure to online pornography, posting 
personal information or pictures online, having contact with unknown people on social media, 
voluntary sexting, and video chatting with strangers. Cyber-bullying victimization and perpetration  
is associated with children’s greater exposure to negative online content and to cyber-dating 
violence. 
4 Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and intersex.
5 In our search of the recent literature we found no studies of the experiences of children with special educational needs or disabilities, 
though there are reports documenting their greater exposure to online risks. 9
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 There is a connection between offending and victimization. For example, both the victims and 
perpetrators of cyber-bullying tend to report weaker offline social ties and support from friends and 
family, higher rates of loneliness, being less liked at school, and lower psychological well-being. 
Perpetrators of cyber-bullying and sextortion are also more likely to be victims. Online and offline 
perpetration and victimization are also highly correlated. This suggests that when children become the 
target of hurtful behaviour, some respond in the same way, creating a snowball effect of risky conduct. 
What do we know about protective factors?
There is limited evidence on what can protect children from negative online experiences and harm. 
Some exploratory studies suggest that social support and children’s positive relationships with the 
people around them can act as protective factors. Children who lack such social resources face a 
double disadvantage: they are more likely to experience online risks and are less likely to seek help.
Protective factors may differ based on the type of online risk, though existing evidence addresses only 
a few risks. For example, a positive relationship with parents, parental monitoring of children’s 
activities, teacher care, enforced school rules, higher self-efficacy, self-confidence and resilience are all 
protective factors for cyber-bullying. For cyber-dating violence, parental monitoring and emotional 
bonding can be protective factors. 
Encouragement and support from parents, teachers and peers can help children to become more 
confident internet users. This is especially true for younger children. Parents can reduce risks by 
imposing restrictions such as limiting the time children spend online. But this can impede children’s 
skills and hinder opportunities. 
Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in safety 
strategies. Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect children’s privacy behaviours. 
Protecting children online is more efficient when combined with supportive parenting more generally 
(i.e., offline). For example, emerging evidence on cyber-bullying shows that children’s overall 
relationships with their parents and general offline monitoring of their day-to-day activities reduces 
children’s risk of cyber-bullying – more so than monitoring their online activities specifically. 
What research gaps do we need to fill?
  Robust, high-quality and comparable research is still necessary. In many areas, knowledge 
remains tentative. The large majority of studies we found are based on small or non-representative 
samples, involve correlational analyses of cross-sectional data and control for a limited number of 
background variables. While such studies offer some insights, their limitations make it difficult to 
establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the 
child’s wider life environment.
  We need a better representation of the diversity of children’s circumstances. At present, most 
research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North. Evidence 
regarding the pre-teenage years and from global South countries is sparse. Filling these gaps will 
enhance our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability, and the protective factors 
that help to build resilience. 10
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   We still need to learn more about the positive effects of children’s internet use. Only one fifth (79 
out of 359) of the studies identified by the search explore opportunities and benefits of internet 
use. In contrast, children’s encounters with certain online risks – particularly excessive internet use, 
cyber-bullying, gambling and problematic gaming – feature heavily in the research literature. 
  Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet, without including 
variables related to the perceived quality or context of their internet use, for example, negative 
experiences related to online victimization or cyber-bullying. The focus on time spent above quality 
or context of use is a serious limitation, which constrains our understanding of which activities and 
risks are more likely to influence children’s outcomes. 
  There are significant cross-country differences in children’s exposure to opportunities and risks. We 
need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of children’s internet use to develop 
a better understanding of what factors determine such differences and for which groups of children. 
To do so, we also need more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable 
comparative research. This has been a key objective of research conducted by the EU Kids Online 
and Global Kids Online research networks.
  More evidence is needed on the outcomes of children’s internet use. While studies may link 
children’s online experiences to risk and protective (predictive) factors in their life circumstances, 
they rarely follow up on the consequences of children’s internet use over time, to document either 
benefits or harms. The evidence is particularly scarce in relation to long-term outcomes such 
as well-being, mental health and resilience, which require longitudinal research. To develop the 
longitudinal evidence base in this field, long-term investment and commitment to explore the 
outcomes of children’s internet use is needed. 
  We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are 
linked, for example, children’s online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both. 
Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations, 
and generated hypotheses about how these shape children’s well-being in an increasingly digital 
world, few recently published studies have tested these models.6
  We need a better understanding of children’s digital ecology. There needs to be some exploration 
of the nature of digital devices, and online platforms and their policies, applications, services and 
networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm. 
  The pathways between children’s online and offline vulnerability, exposure to both offline and 
online risks, and children’s responses to risk remain underexplored. Investigating these pathways 
would entail developing a model of mechanisms mapping the digital ecology, perpetrators’ 
behaviours, children’s digital skills and online activities, and children’s background and living 
environment (home, school, community) with the occurrence of different types of risk and harm 
online. This is a main purpose of the Disrupting Harm project.  
 
 
6 We have begun this process in our recent 11-country comparative report, comparing Global Kids Online findings for cross-national 
similarities and differences (see: Global Kids Online comparative report ). See also Setting the agenda for future research and analysis  
(Stoilova et al., 2020) and the projects CO:RE – Children Online: Research and Evidence  and Youth Skills (ySKILLS) .11
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03  There is an urgent need for child-centred research methods to complement the recent 
evidence.7 We still do not understand enough about how children see these issues. We 
need research on cultures of childhood, as they are experienced by children, and how these 
cultures change (or not) due to the online environment. For example, are there online sexual 
activities that may be tolerated or even encouraged because they have positive impacts on 
children’s evolving identities, even though they may involve a level of risk? If so, how much 
risk is acceptable, and how do children themselves view and mitigate such risks? Above all, 
researchers should conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences 
in their own words.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 1. INTRODUCTION 
An estimated one in three internet users globally is a child. This number is likely to be even higher in 
the global South.8 Access to digital technology can help children to develop the skills and literacies they 
need to learn and prepare for life in an increasingly digital society. It can give them access to health or 
education services or information on topics that are important for young people but may be taboo in 
their societies. Yet internet access may also compound risks to children that, unless managed, could 
undermine their well-being. Most importantly, engagement with technologies is increasingly a means 
of realizing children’s rights, as set out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Use 
of digital technology is a key driver of change and partly underpins the realization of the Sustainable 
Development Goals.9
To develop appropriate policy and programme responses, stakeholders need robust evidence on how 
children use the internet. They need evidence on whether children can make use of the many 
opportunities it offers. They also need to identify which risks of harm children may face online. Such 
evidence can significantly contribute to the development of policies and programmes that support 
children and their parents, teachers, law enforcement officers and others who bear responsibilities for 
the protection of children. It can also help the private sector to protect child rights and make decisions 
informed by the best interests of the child. 
There have been numerous efforts to improve the global evidence base and support advocacy, policy 
development and programming in this area. Two such research efforts are particularly important to this 
review because they generate an international comparative evidence base of cross-sectional, nationally 
representative research with children and parents. 
The first is Global Kids Online, which was initiated in 2015 by the UNICEF Office of Research – Innocenti, 
the London School of Economics and Political Science, and the EU Kids Online network. The project, 
conducted in collaboration with country partners around the world, uses a research framework that 
seeks to assess the balance between online opportunities and risks of harm for children’s well-being. 
The framework takes into account how interactions between offline and online factors may make a 
difference to children’s experiences and outcomes.10 It facilitates North-South and South-South 
collaboration and builds the capacity of national research institutions to increase sustainability in 
evidence generation. Since 2016, directly comparable survey research has been fielded in 18 countries, 
covering more than 25,000 children and 12,000 parents.11 In 2019, the EU Kids Online network expanded 
upon the Global Kids Online methodology and fielded comparable survey research in an additional 20 
countries. We use the Global Kids Online research framework as a point of reference.12

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Harm explores in depth children’s experiences of online violence and sexual exploitation and abuse in 
14 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa and Southeast Asia. 
This evidence review supports these research efforts by contributing to the development of the 
Disrupting Harm survey methodology, as implemented by UNICEF . It also responds to the broader need 
for evidence on the positive and negative effects of internet use on children’s well-being. It assesses 
recent advances in the understanding and measurement of children’s online experiences, identifies 
recent developments in the field, and highlights pressing research gaps and limitations.13 In light of 
growing concerns about the potential for harm to children in the digital environment, we pay particular 
attention to research on children’s online privacy and the risk of online violence and sexual exploitation 
and abuse.
Our research was guided by the following questions:
  What is the most recent evidence on how children’s internet use contributes positively to child 
outcomes and well-being?
  What is the most recent evidence on how children’s internet use can amplify the risk of harm and 
potentially undermine their well-being?
  How can we identify the pathways to harm and vulnerability, and the protective factors that help to 
build resilience in children?
  What are the remaining research gaps?

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 2. METHODOLOGY
2.1. Evidence review methodology
A rapid evidence review  method was used for this report. This rapid review used systematic 
methods to search for and critically appraise published research.14 Rapid evidence reviews are 
rigorous and explicit in their methodological approach, and thus systematic, but make 
concessions to the breadth or depth of the process (for example, by limiting the amount of grey 
literature, extracting only key variables and performing a simpler quality appraisal). This report 
groups the rapid review findings around key aspects of children’s internet use, and identifies 
future research needed to address evidence gaps. 
We conducted keyword searches of the title, abstract and text of studies in the Web of Science and 
Scopus  databases. We blended several groups of keywords: technology-based, child-based, 
method-based and violence-based ( see Appendix ). This yielded 2,090 search results, which were 
screened initially by title and abstract only and then by the full text. Details of the search protocol 
are discussed in the Appendix. The screening was based on whether the studies met the following 
predefined  inclusion criteria: 
  publication based on primary survey research with children (under 18 years) or review article 
offering a summary of recent high-quality studies
  from any country but published in English
  published since 2016 to account for advances in technology and how children use the internet
  deriving from research that was of a high quality, methodologically robust and preferably 
published in a peer-reviewed journal
The requirement for a high-qua lity methodology was applied differently across the research themes. 
For themes where we found little research (such as activities and opportunities in relation to civic 
participation, learning and socializing), the criteria were more inclusive and some exploratory studies 
are discussed. In such cases, we treat the findings as indicative, offering an insight into where more 
robust research could be productive. For themes where more research is available (notably risk of harm 
online in relation to cyber-bullying), we focus on studies with more robust methodologies and 
representative survey samples. 
After applying the inclusion criteria, the resulting of 359 studies – the final sample – were coded and 
summarized for the review.
2.2. Analysis
We develop ed a code for each of the key research themes, using a top-down coding framework based 
on well-established models of children’s internet use.15 The final search results were allocated to the 
relevant themes, allowing for one article to receive multiple codes. New codes were formulated to 
facilitate the development of a more comprehensive review of online violence and sexual exploitation 
and abuse. Each study was analysed for its findings, methods and measures, and suggestions for 
furthe r research.

2.3. Limitations
Limitations of the rapid evidence review
This evidence review updates previous reviews of the evidence on children’s internet use,18 and cross-
country comparisons by the Global Kids Online network.19 It includes only the most recent studies 
(published since 2016) across a range of research themes. As a result, valuable earlier studies were 
omitted and should be considered separately for a full, in-depth review. Our purpose was to discover 
new developments and the themes studied most recently, how they have been researched (methods 
and gaps) and what the newest evidence suggests. We did not expand the search with additional 
16 These studies were coded but then excluded from the analysis as this area has already been extensively covered elsewhere. A full 
review would be required to account for existing methodological shortcomings and limitations inherent to this sub-field, which was 
beyond the scope of this assignment. For a recent review and discussion paper by UNICEF covering excessive internet use and 
gaming, see: Kardefelt-Winther (2017); UNICEF (2019a).
17 We explore sexual activities separately from risks of harm online, partly to provide a more specific focus on risks related to sexual 
activities, but also to suggest that not all of children’s sexual activities are risky; some may be part of children’s sexual exploration and 
identity.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 keywords specific to each theme, such as access- or skills-related words, because each theme-specific 
search could constitute a separate evidence review. Restricting the search to the English language and 
to databases mainly oriented to the global North limited the evidence found from non-English-speaking 
countries and the global South. 
Limitations of the available research literature 
We found a substantial imbalance across the reviewed research themes of children’s internet use ( see 
Figure 1 ). While some areas, such as addiction, gambling and problematic gaming, receive considerable 
attention, others remain comparatively under-researched. We excluded the body of literature concerned 
with hypothesized addiction to the internet, gambling and excessive gaming, partly because these areas 
have been covered elsewhere, but also because of methodological shortcomings that make it difficult to 
interpret these results reliably. A reliable interpretation would require a tailored review to query specific 
methodological issues, which was beyond the scope of this assignment.20 Generally, we found more 
literature on children’s encounters with online risks than on their positive experiences, activities and 
skills. This suggests a need for a better balance in research on children’s internet use. Another imbalance 
relates to the type of research participant. Studies most often sample older teenagers, while research on 
children under 12 years of age is generally missing from the evidence base. Some studies conflate 
children with young adults. 
The studies we reviewed vary significantly in the definitions and the measures used for ostensibly the 
same construct, for example, cyber-bullying. This makes comparability across studies difficult. The large 
majority of studies are based on small or non-representative samples that make it difficult to generalize 
from the findings. Where such studies are included in the review, the findings should be considered with 
caution. They are exploratory in nature and highlight possible areas for further research. Many studies 
conduct correlational analyses of cross-sectional data. This means that they cannot establish what is 
cause and effect or determine long-term consequences. This makes the task of establishing a pathway to 
harm and vulnerability, or protective factors for resilience particularly difficult. The analysis cannot 
determine whether an effect, for instance, a high level of harm, is the cause or the consequence of a 
child using digital technology. We draw insights, where available, from the small number of longitudinal 
studies found in the review. More longitudinal research, or research that deploys research designs that 
support causal inferences, is needed to reach conclusions about the effect of children’s internet use on 
their well-being in the long term.
Also problematic is that, in their statistical analyses, most studies control for a limited number of 
background variables. These tend to prioritize children’s psychological characteristics or their internet 
use. They only rarely examine the role of factors relating to the child’s life situation, home environment 
or parental mediation. A broad consideration of neighbourhood or community effects, country-level 
indicators, poverty and inequalities is often missing. As discussed in a 2017 UNICEF review, this makes it 
difficult to establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from 
the child’s wider environment.21
Bearing the above in mind, we begin the discussion of each research theme with a brief note to explain 
the definitions and research methods typically used. We note the limitations of the research, highlight 
the key findings and draw out suggestions for further research.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 3. ACCESS
Access refers to how children log on to the internet. It includes what devices they use to go online and 
the places of access, such as home, school, a friend’s house or an internet café. It also includes how 
much time children spend online, and whether they can go online when they need or want to, or 
experience some barriers in terms of permission, cost or connectivity. 
We reviewed 15 studies on this theme. They are diverse in relation to their geographical location as 
well as the areas they address. The locations were Chile, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Singapore, 
Spain, Switzerland and the United States of America. A comparative study looked at Belgium, Denmark, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The 
areas covered included the connections between access and learning outcomes, reading habits, and 
online activities and opportunities, and the links between access and digital skills. A few studies 
examine the impact of inequalities on internet access. Most of these reports provide only descriptive 
statistics derived from samples that are small or close at hand, and sometimes both. While it is 
unsuitable to use these limited studies for cross-country comparisons of prevalence, they broadly 
support the trends identified by the larger, representative surveys reviewed. 
Key findings
  Regardless of the country or context, children tend to mainly use mobile phones to go online.
  There are important differences in access between countries based on the level of internet and 
device uptake. Countries with lower levels of uptake tend to have more access inequalities. 
Children from poorer backgrounds face more barriers to going online. 
  Countries with high internet and device penetration see narrowing gaps in relation to access. Here, 
disparities relate more to the quality and cost of connectivity, which affects what children do when 
they are online.
  There are important differences in access relating to the age of first access and the number of 
devices used. Children from wealthier backgrounds and country contexts tend to go online from a 
younger age and have access to a larger number of internet-connected devices.
  Access inequalities also relate to the availability of competent support and mediation, especially 
when children are younger.
  In contexts with lower internet penetration, children tend to lead the way and be online more than 
the adults around them. This raises important questions about parental support and mediation.
A few high-quality studies examine access inequalities among children. In their 2016 study,22 
Mascheroni and Ólafsson use data collected through the Net Children Go Mobile survey of 
approximately 3,500 respondents aged 9–16 years across seven European countries (Belgium, 
Denmark, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom). They conclude that a combination 
of social inequalities and differences in access to digital technologies results in disparities in online 
activities. In these countries, the probability of children owning a smartphone increases by 58 per cent 
on average for each year they grow older (from the age of 9 years), though the exact figure varies by 
22 (Mascheroni and Ólafsson, 2016)18
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 country. Boys and girls get their first smartphone at a similar age. While in these countries socio-
economic status is not related to smartphone ownership, children who start to use the internet later 
than average are less likely to own a smartphone, as are children whose parents do not use a 
smartphone to go online.
A longitudinal study in Switzerland of 1,083 students aged 10–15 years and 914 parents also shows that 
a family’s socio-economic status on its own predicts neither children’s internet access nor the 
availability of digital devices, when controlling for children’s academic performance.23 This may be due 
to a number of factors such as devices being relatively inexpensive, affluent parents trying to limit their 
children’s access to devices, or parents with a lower socio-economic status trying to ‘catch up’ and buy 
devices for their children to avoid social exclusion. A family’s socio-economic status is, however, 
associated with how children use the internet. In this study from Switzerland, children from lower 
socio-economic backgrounds tended to use the internet more often as a form of communication and 
entertainment and less often for educational purposes. Children who had access to a larger number of 
digital devices also tended to use the internet more often for entertainment and socializing, but this 
was not related to socio-economic status.
Children’s smartphone ownership depends partly on how their family uses mobile devices. It also 
depends on where the country stands on smartphone adoption – in terms of the availability and cost of 
devices and data as well as the mainstream culture of adoption. Age creates important differences. 
Younger children are less likely to use a smartphone to go online daily and are less likely to have an 
internet plan on their phone. The availability and cost of connectivity also matter, as do parental 
decisions to limit children’s unsupervised internet use, especially at a younger age. Some access 
inequalities can create further divides in relation to how children use the internet. If children start to use 
the internet at an older age or do not use a mobile phone daily, they tend to engage in fewer online 
activities. Research from Global Kids Online suggests that engaging in fewer online activities can have 
a detrimental effect on the development of digital skills.24 While this effect decreases with age, it 
remains significant even for older children.25 
Several studies with samples too small or unrepresentative to generalize from the findings offer 
interesting, though only indicative, insights into children’s internet access. For example, a survey of 
children aged 16–18 years living in Moscow shows that even when children are not allowed to use 
mobile devices at school, many still do. The lack of integration of digital technologies into the 
educational process may, however, affect the type of activities they do online. Instead of using mobile 
phones to learn and look for information, children may focus on entertainment and socializing.26
A United States-based study researching the internet access of 181 runaways or homeless children and 
youth shows that children and youth who are better educated or employed are more likely to own a 
mobile phone. Digital devices are an important source of connection for homeless children, including 
staying in touch with family members, who in some cases pay the phone bills.27
Finally, a survey of 251 parents and 381 children in Chile showed that children use different strategies

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 to influence their parents’ adoption of new technologies. Whether children are successful depends on 
various factors, including the type of device they want. Success also depends on whether they use 
argumentative strategies (taking into account their family’s or parents’ perspectives by reasoning or 
bargaining) or non-argumentative strategies (begging, demanding or whining) to influence technology 
adoption.28 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  Most studies offer a narrow understanding of access to the internet. It is most often researched in 
relation to being able to go online and having a digital device available. Other important factors 
that can create access inequalities are rarely explored, including cultural factors and parental 
attitudes. In some contexts, cultural factors may even create additional inequalities, for example, 
in relation to gender, which should be explored further, especially among non-internet-using 
children.29 
  More research is needed on the effects on access of the quality, cost and availability of connectivity. 
Impacts of parental mediation strategies that encourage or discourage children to go online need 
to be better understood, together with the effects of the availability of devices in different settings, 
including at school. 
  We need to better understand how access inequalities create further divisions in terms of the 
range and complexity of online activities that children engage in, and the extent to which these 
differences become long-term effects.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 4. ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES 
4.1. Activities and opportunities in general
Children engage in a broad range of activities online. These include learning, community and civic 
participation, creativity, engagement in social relationships, and online communication. These 
activities may result in tangible benefits to children. Sexting and watching pornography may be 
experienced as opportunities by some children and as risks by others. These activities are 
discussed later in the report.  
The review includes 33 studies of online opportunities for children. An additional six studies examine 
digital health. Five explore digital citizenship. These were reviewed separately to gain additional 
insights. The main 33 studies on activities and opportunities focus mostly on Europe and North 
America. Some also cover Australia, China, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Korea, 
Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. The studies mainly use survey methods but some use mixed 
methods, focus groups or interviews. The quantitative research comprises a panel study30 and a few 
school-based surveys with stratified sampling.31 But the majority of surveys use small, convenience or 
self-selected samples. Some studies control for only a limited number of variables. A few samples 
include young adults, aged 18 years and above. 
Key findings
  The online activities in which children engage depend on their gender, country context, socio-
economic status, smartphone ownership and age. 
  What children do online is much more important for their outcomes than how much time they 
spend online. 
  Platforms can be used for different purposes and result in different benefits for children. For 
example, social media are mainly used for communication and socializing but can offer learning 
opportunities for those children who seek such benefits. 
  How children engage with the internet depends on a range of factors, including their needs, 
preferences and abilities. 
  Information-seeking activities are particularly valuable to children dealing with sensitive issues 
such as sexuality and health. Receiving support can be helpful for children dealing with hardship.
The Net Children Go Mobile survey shows that girls are more likely to use the internet for schoolwork 
and social networking than boys. It was conducted in seven European countries (Belgium, Denmark, 
Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Romania and the United Kingdom). There are, however, cross-country 
differences. For example, children in the United Kingdom are significantly less likely than those in Italy, 
Portugal and Romania to use social networking sites.32 Findings from the same study also indicate that 
European children from medium and higher socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to use the 
internet for schoolwork and learning activities than those with a lower socio-economic status. Some of

32 (Mascheroni and Ólafsson, 2016)21
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 these findings are contradicted by a study conducted in the Republic of Korea. It shows that neither 
gender nor the parents’ academic background is significantly related to a child’s use of the internet for 
studying.33 This points to the possibility that some of these relationships vary by country and regional 
context.
The evidence suggests that there is a relationship between which devices children use, how long they 
stay online and the type of online activities they engage in. For example, Mascheroni and Ólafsson (2016) 
found that daily smartphone use is not related to using the internet for schoolwork, but is associated with 
more engagement in entertainment and communication activities. These activities are considered more 
participatory than schoolwork because they involve things like playing games; sharing or downloading 
photos, videos or music; sharing files; posting messages; and creating a pet or an avatar. 
Some indicative research suggests that there may be a relationship between the time spent online and 
the type of activities in which children engage. According to a study in Sweden, children who spend 90 
minutes or more online per day are more likely to play games and surf the web (e.g., to seek leisure-
related information), while children who are online less tend to engage more in social communication 
and information-seeking.34 
There is longitudal evidence that using social media can develop children’s affective and cognitive 
empathy. This enables them to share, understand and recognize other people’s emotions.35 Some 
studies also emphasize the importance of self-disclosure for receiving support from peers. Children 
who use social networking sites discuss more personal information with their offline friends than 
children who do not have a social media account, according to a study in Germany of a stratified 
sample of 1,890 children aged 10–16 years.36 
A Belgian study of 1,943 high school students, aged 10–20 years and recruited via random stratified 
sampling, found that self-disclosure is positively associated with higher emotional support received 
from friends.37 Exchanging messages online with friends reinforces a sense of companionship because 
of its characteristic of ‘any time, any place’ connectivity, which allows them to chit-chat and micro-
coordinate activities.38 Intimate self-disclosure is also associated with children’s perceived privacy and 
control over the content in messaging with friends. 
Socializing can also be linked to online learning opportunities, particularly in countries where such 
opportunities are facilitated by the education system. Children sometimes use social media to manage 
homework tasks or engage with content related to homework.39 When time spent on social media is 
used for studying, it is associated with better school performance.40 On the other hand, the evidence 
shows that spending more time on social media (more than two hours a day) is negatively associated 
with school performance if social media are not used for study-related activities.41

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Some indicative findings from smaller studies suggest that the internet can offer benefits to hard-to-
reach children and those in vulnerable situations, such as children dealing with drug use, mental health 
problems42 or self-harm,43 by making it easier to access information and seek help. These indicative 
findings suggest that technologically driven interventions to improve child well-being may be useful for 
some children.
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  While there is evidence that smartphone use is linked to variations in children’s online activities, it 
is not clear how the type or number of devices used is associated with different activities. 
  Some activities, such as learning, socializing and play, have received more attention in the recent 
research evidence, while others, such as creativity, health and participation, are discussed much 
less. More evidence is needed across the full spectrum of online opportunities to understand which 
activities lead to positive outcomes and how existing inequalities may be overcome. 
  A broader range of predictors of online activities and opportunities should be considered. Most 
studies omit variables related to digital skills, parental mediation or the influence of peers and the 
community. This makes it difficult to understand how different skills or family attitudes enable or 
restrict children in taking advantage of online opportunities. 
  Future research should also explore whether and how positive online experiences of children are 
related to tangible, long-term benefits. If some children yield greater benefits than others, research 
should uncover the factors that create these differences. The potential of the internet to provide 
social and emotional support for children requires more attention in future research. This would 
include what type of support is most beneficial and how to reach those children who most need 
support. There is also very little research on peer versus intergenerational communication and its 
impact on well-being. The potential of peer support needs to be better examined.
4.2. Digital health
On an individual level, digital health refers to the use of the internet and digital technologies to 
maintain or improve health and lifestyle. It may involve searching for a broad range of health-related 
information. This includes information on healthy eating and nutrition; exercise or sports, sexual or 
reproductive health, mental health, disease or injury, and treatment or medication. Digital health also 
refers to using specific applications, software programs or devices to monitor, plan, share or discuss 
issues related to health or lifestyle. Such issues include weight loss, exercise, food intake and mood.
The six studies reviewed mainly cover countries in Europe and North America, including Germany, the 
Netherlands, Northern Ireland (in the United Kingdom) and the United States. One study was 
conducted in Nigeria. The methodologies encompass a range of methods, from secondary data and 
meta-analysis44 to web-based focus groups45 and surveys. The surveys are mostly cross-sectional, 
involving convenience samples and multi-stage random sampling of schools46 or clustered random

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 sampling of schools.47 The one longitudinal panel study used a small, non-probability sample.48 The 
methodological shortcomings of the studies include small samples and insufficient information about 
controls.
Key findings
  The digital environment is an important source of health information and support for children, both 
in relation to physical and to mental health. 
  Children value that the internet provides anonymity, access to reliable information, glimpses of the 
experiences of peers, and support-seeking options. 
  Children use a variety of online channels to access digital health content. They usually try to judge 
the reliability of the source and the particular benefits it provides, but this can sometimes be 
difficult for them. 
  Not everyone is equally able to benefit. Looking for health information online is positively 
associated with having a higher level of digital skills. 
  Digital health outcomes are rarely discussed and the evidence on effectiveness is somewhat mixed 
and insufficient.
Several studies explore how children seek health information online. They show that trusted and 
high-quality online health information is important to young people. A survey in Germany of 1,162 
students aged 13–16 years shows that the aspects most frequently cited as important for digital health 
information are: easily comprehensible wording (cited by 88 per cent of respondents), clear layout (81 
per cent) and perceived reliability of the website’s publisher (79 per cent). The visual style of a website 
and whether it is explicitly aimed at students are deemed less important. Girls are nearly twice as likely 
as boys to attach importance to the publisher’s reliability, especially those girls who do not have a 
migrant background or who attend a school in the highest academic tier.49 
Children also evaluate the reliability of online information by determining whether the same 
information appears on multiple websites, and if it corresponds with what they know from offline 
sources such as family, friends or school. Websites associated with medical institutions, such as 
pharmacies or health care providers, are generally considered reliable, as are websites explicitly aimed 
at educating youth about sexual and reproductive health.50 Forums with user-generated content are 
seen as beneficial for offering glimpses of the experiences or opinions of others,51 and for providing 
opportunities for informal support through online peer networks.52 
A survey in Nigeria of 1,186 students aged 11–19 years found that 63 per cent of children and young 
people use the internet to seek health information on a weekly basis.53 The most popular search topics

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 include: healthy diet and nutrition; body size, shape and image; sexually transmitted infections; and 
other sexual issues. The availability of easily accessible online information is particularly valuable for 
the hard-to-reach children who struggle to seek help face to face. A study of 527 boys from Northern 
Ireland aged 11–16 years found that one quarter of those who seek information online will not tell 
anyone about a mental health issue. They place particular value on the anonymity of digital health 
information, resources and support services.54 
The internet also provides opportunities for children to access information on sexual health and 
relationships, mental health support and general health services. A study in the Netherlands shows 
factors related to children’s identity and circumstances may influence how they engage with online 
information.55 For example, LGBTQI children and those with more knowledge about sex and sexuality 
are more likely to consult sexual information online. Girls, children who know more about sex and 
sexuality, and those who communicate with friends (rather than parents) about sex tend to seek sexual 
information from professional websites. Boys and children with low sexual self-esteem and high sexual 
curiosity are more likely to use, interactive, user-generated online content.56 
The study in Nigeria revealed that children who have more advanced digital skills are more likely to use 
the internet for health information.57 The study in Northern Ireland found no significant impact of 
economic status, geographical location or educational attainment on the online help-seeking habits of 
boys in relation to health.58 The study suggests that boys who use online help-seeking to supplement 
offline support may gain more mental health benefits. Boys who have larger online friend networks, 
and those who have confided in online friends regarding personal problems, also have better mental 
health outcomes.59 This suggests that a lack of online social support may create inequalities among 
children.
Long-term digital health outcomes are rarely discussed. The evidence on effectiveness is both 
insufficient and somewhat inconsistent. A review of the evidence on changes in children’s health 
behaviour found that mobile health interventions can have a positive effect on children’s health 
outcomes.60 Furthermore, interventions supported by caregivers produce larger changes in health 
outcomes, on average, than those that exclusively target children.61 Yet, another review of the evidence 
on the effects of mobile health, including use of wearable activity trackers to increase physical activity 
outcomes among healthy children, found no evidence of an effect among all interventions.62

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Limitations and suggestions for further research
  More evidence that is methodologically robust and comparable is needed to assess how 
children benefit from digital health information, resources and support services. The conclusions 
from current findings are limited by the small number of studies, differences in measurement, 
dissimilarities in the digital health content assessed, and the methodological challenges of the 
study designs. 
  More evaluations are needed of digital health interventions. Another area for future research is to 
explore how the relationship between youth health behaviours and outcomes is related to factors 
at the individual, family and community level, and influenced by health care systems. 
  Further analyses of the relationship between seeking mental health information and support and 
children’s exposure to online harm could be helpful, especially in relation to targeting online harm 
interventions.
4.3. Digital citizenship
Digital citizenship is an umbrella term. It covers the role of digital technologies in the development of 
children’s political interest, civic identity and engagement in politics. It also covers their understanding 
of citizenship values, their civic engagement and their rights in the digital world. 
The five studies reviewed cover four European countries and Indonesia. They are mainly quantitative in 
nature, with a mixture of convenience or small samples and longitudinal panel surveys using random 
cluster sampling of schools.63 
Key findings
  Digital technologies are children’s preferred medium for learning about new ideas and civic 
participation. On their own, however, digital technologies have a somewhat limited ability to create 
proactive and ongoing civic participation among children. 
  Children who actively seek political content online are more likely to develop a stronger interest in 
politics over time than children who come across this content by chance, even if they engage with it 
by commenting or sharing.
  Offline engagement in civic activities, such as taking part in a demonstration, distributing leaflets or 
wearing a T -shirt, is more likely to create a sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens. 
Online participation in civic activities, such as expressing an opinion on social media, writing a 
blog, creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll, is less likely to create a civic identity.
  Still, civic participation online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and help 
children to create new and independent opinions. 
A five-year longitudinal study in Sweden on the relations between online media use and political 
interest among children aged 13–14 years (wave 1) and young people aged 18–19 years (wave 5) found 
that children who actively engage with political content online develop a stronger interest in politics 
over time. This effect is relatively weak. On the other hand, children who come across political content 
63 (Machackova and Serek, 2017; Moeller et al., 2018) 26
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 online by chance do not develop a stronger interest in politics over time. The study also found that a 
range of other factors, such as changes in family socio-economic status, children’s total news 
consumption across different platforms, and interpersonal discussions with parents or peers, appear to 
have no effect on later political interest.64 
The importance of proactive engagement with political information is also demonstrated by an 
Austrian study with 294 children and young people aged 15–20 years. The study explored intentional 
(proactive seeking) and incidental (coming across politics material randomly) engagement in politics 
offline and online. The study also asked whether the effects differ based on children’s motivations for 
internet use. These include using the internet for self-expression, entertainment, socializing or to look 
for political information. Children who use the internet because they are interested in political 
information or self-expression are significantly more likely to intentionally engage in politics both 
online and offline. Children who use the internet mainly for entertainment purposes, which defines 
most of the children in the sample, are unlikely to engage in politics offline but may spontaneously 
engage in politics online. This may be via activities such as liking, sharing or commenting on political 
posts in a random or non-proactive way. Hence, exposure to online political content can lead to higher 
engagement in politics but only for children who are already interested in politics or self-expression, 
and only if they come across political content online intentionally.65 For the other children included in 
this study, engagement with online political material did not seem to lead to active or long-term civic 
participation.66 
A similar approach, distinguishing offline and online civic participation, was adopted in a two-wave 
panel study conducted in Czechia with 768 adolescents aged 14–17 years.67 The findings show that the 
development of civic identity (the sense of connection and responsibility to fellow citizens) is not 
affected by online participation, but it is positively predicted by offline participation. In this study, online 
participation involves signing an online petition, expressing an opinion on social media, writing a blog, 
creating an online group or voting in an opinion poll. Offline participation is about taking part in a 
demonstration, distributing leaflets, wearing a T -shirt or another symbol, or signing a paper petition. 
Surprisingly, the study found no effect of either online or offline participation on children’s political 
self-efficacy (trust in government and belief that they can influence politics). Online participation, on the 
other hand, is linked to greater acceptance of unconventional, authority-challenging activism and to 
more negative attitudes towards social authorities and conventions. A possible explanation is that 
participating online can create exposure to more diverse sources of information and create new and 
independent opinions in a way that offline participation does not.68

  Political participation is covered by a substantial part of the literature. It would benefit from a more 
comprehensive approach whereby digital citizenship is also understood and studied in relation to 
child identity and belonging, civic engagement, children’s agency and rights, and the formation of 
values through online engagement.  
  It would be beneficial to develop our understanding of the factors that help children to advance 
their engagement in digital citizenship activities. This would help us to understand how the digital 
environment can facilitate and enhance children’s agency and rights.
  We need to know more about groups of children who are marginalized and under-represented, or 
even persecuted, in relation to their digital citizenship activities, and identify ways in which their 
voices can be heard in all cultural, social and political contexts. 28
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 5. DIGITAL SKILLS
The definition of skills in the literature we reviewed varies from the general ability to use the internet69 
to specific skills related to the digital environment. These specific skills include the ability to determine 
the credibility of online sources and information,70 possession of online social skills,71 and the ability to 
identify whether people met online are who they say they are.72 More comprehensive, 
multidimensional models include operational skills, browsing skills, social skills, creative skills, mobile 
skills, personal-security skills, critical skills and device-security skills.73 
We reviewed seven studies on digital skills. They used both qualitative74 and quantitative methods.75 
Two studies include parents as well as children.76 The quantitative research ranges from large 
representative surveys used for cross-country comparisons, used in two studies, to small and 
convenience samples and studies, which do not clarify their sampling methods. The research is mostly 
based in Europe, except for two studies that focus on Malaysia and Latin America (the Plurinational 
State of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay). 
Key findings 
  Better digital skills are associated with more online opportunities but also more online risks.
  Parents tend to use restrictive mediation when they or their child have a lower level of digital 
skills. Restrictive mediation reduces online risks mostly at the expense of digital skills and online 
opportunities.
  In countries with low internet adoption, children tend to be better internet users than their parents. 
In such cases, parents rely on their children and use the internet less on their own, hence they are 
less able to provide support to their children when needed. 
  It is difficult to measure children’s digital skills. The studies mostly rely on children’s self-
assessment rather than performance testing, which means that some more confident children may 
overestimate their digital skills. 
Several studies suggest that better digital skills are associated with more online activities but also more 
online risks.77 Skills have a decisive role in how children engage with the internet and in what their 
parents allow or encourage them to do online.78 A nationally representative survey of 6,400 parents of 
children aged 6–14 years from eight European countries shows that children who are encouraged to 
take advantage of online opportunities and are actively supported by their parents tend to do more

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 things online and have better digital skills.79 However, they also face higher levels of risk. To limit that 
risk, parents sometimes use restrictive mediation, such as taking away devices, not allowing children to 
go online or limiting what they can do. This reduces risk but it also reduces children’s digital skills and, 
through this, reduces the activities children engage in. Children are more likely to be restricted when 
they are younger, when they have a lower level of digital skills or when their parents have a lower level 
of digital skills.80 However, a school-based survey in Spain of 1,446 students aged 12–18 years shows 
that associations between digital skills and online opportunities are stronger than those between digital 
skills and online risks.81 This means that restricting children is reducing online risks mostly at the 
expense of online opportunities. 
A 2019 study explored the intergenerational transmission of digital skills and internet use in the context 
of countries with low to moderate levels of internet adoption. The authors look at how children’s 
internet use and skills affect parental internet use and skills. The study is based on large-scale surveys 
with children and young people aged 5–27 years in six Latin American countries (the Plurinational State 
of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay). It found that the intergenerational transfer 
of motivation and skills from children to adults is, on average, outweighed by ‘leaning effects’. This 
means that parents rely on children to perform online tasks for them. Hence, parents whose children 
are better internet users tend to rely on them and use the internet less on their own. 
A qualitative study with 102 girls aged 12–13 years and 15–17 years in the Netherlands explored skills 
and confidence in determining whether an online stranger was an adult or a peer.82 The findings 
suggest that most girls are confident in their ability to identify an adult with possible sexual intentions, 
but less than half of them (45 per cent) are actually able to do it. When unsure about whom they are in 
contact with, most girls apply a strategy that does not involve interaction with the person. They scan 
the profile page of the stranger, checking the contact information, the profile picture and whether they 
have friends in common. When mutual friends are present, trust increases significantly and girls are 
less critical. If still unsure, girls ask their friends in common about the stranger or, more often, continue 
the conversation with the stranger to find out more. Important cues that alarm girls are when the other 
person ignores personal questions, shows an exaggerated amount of interest, acts as a friend and 
makes sexual comments. The study also found that girls in the younger group (aged 12–13 years) 
report more distress when such incidents occur than those in the older group. 
The potential unreliability of children’s self-assessment of their digital skills is addressed by a Swedish 
study on news credibility.83 The study asked 483 students aged 16–19 years to assess their competence 
in finding and evaluating online information. While most respondents rated themselves as quite skilled 
at fact-checking (68 per cent rated their ability as good or very good) and searching for information 
online (79 per cent good or very good), most of them (88 per cent) could not separate news from 
advertisements in a popular online newspaper. Self-reported skills of fact-checking and searching ability 
are inversely associated with performance, but children are better at recognizing manipulated images 
(75 per cent) and identifying such images as poor evidence (81 per cent). The students also had a 
difficult time determining the trustworthiness of credible, biased and false information online. Hence, 
the study concludes that claiming to be good at finding information online is associated with an 
inability to determine the trustworthiness of information.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Limitations and suggestions for further research
  The reviewed literature offers little discussion of how particular skills may be related to higher or 
lower exposure to risks and to what types of risk. A more comprehensive model of skills is needed, 
which can explain what role skills play, if any, in children’s pathways to harm and vulnerability, or in 
the protective factors that help to build resilience.
  The skills literature is almost exclusively digital. It does not examine how offline skills, such as 
critical thinking or social skills, may support children when applied to online situations. More 
research is needed on the possible benefits from the application of such skills in an online 
environment. 
  We found no longitudinal research that could explain differences between children’s digital skills. 
Do children who acquire better digital skills at a younger age have improved outcomes from their 
internet use, and are such effects long-lasting? There are gaps in our knowledge of what factors 
from children’s offline and digital environments create the best conditions for learning digital skills, 
and how best to support children to acquire digital skills. 31
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 6. PRIVACY ONLINE 
Privacy relates to children’s understanding of a range of related issues at the personal, institutional and 
commercial level, and their ability to mitigate privacy-related risk.84 The issues include knowledge of 
how to protect their own and other’s personal information online, what to share and with whom, how 
to use privacy settings and how personal data are collected by businesses or institutions and used for 
monitoring, analyses or commerce. 
The studies we reviewed are mostly from Europe and North America. There are several studies from 
Asia, including from China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore. The quantitative research is 
cross-sectional, with most of the studies using convenience or small samples. Some studies include a 
mixture of children and adults. All findings should be considered indicative.
Key findings 
  Overall, children are less concerned about certain aspects of online privacy than adults and are less 
engaged in privacy management.
  Children who are concerned about their privacy and aware of online risks are more engaged in 
safety strategies. 
  Girls have greater privacy concerns than boys and are more likely to have parental involvement in 
managing their online privacy. 
  Privacy discussions with parents and teachers positively affect privacy behaviours (e.g., having 
a private profile). Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age, while peer mediation 
increases. This is similar to other aspects of internet use.
  The evidence of how skills affect privacy is inconclusive. Having the relevant skills does not 
necessarily mean that children will engage in better privacy protection strategies. 
Most of the studies in our sample examine privacy by exploring the relationship between privacy risks 
and other online risks, such as sexting, sexual exploitation or contact with unknown people. The focus 
is often on children having a public social media profile, sharing information with people they have got 
to know online, using privacy settings, sharing passwords with friends and being concerned about 
privacy.85 Mostly, the studies are interested in exploring the factors that influence online privacy, both 
positively and negatively. These factors include device use; media literacy; mediation by parents, 
teachers or peers; and personal characteristics such as gender, age and personality traits. Some studies 
examine the violation of privacy. Examples include the manipulation or dissemination of personal 
information or images without consent,86 or being monitored by others, such as partners or parents.87 
The findings suggest that gender and age influence online privacy behaviours. A web survey 
administered to 3,763 social media users in Norway, aged 13–50 years, investigated the impact of 
privacy concerns on ‘selfie’ behaviours across gender and age groups. The groups were: adolescents

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 aged 13–19 years, young adults aged 20–30 years and adults aged 31–50 years.88 The adolescents in the 
sample were much less concerned about privacy and less engaged in privacy management than the 
older groups. Female users had greater privacy concerns than male users (across all three age groups) 
and the degree of privacy concern was not influenced by the use of privacy management strategies. 
Adolescent girls who had greater privacy concerns engaged less in taking personal selfies, cropping or 
editing photos, and using photo enhancement filters. There was no influence on group selfie-taking, 
and none of these factors was significant for adolescent boys. 
A United States-based survey of 333 children and young people aged 13–21 years, though limited in 
terms of generalizability, found that gender can be an important factor in determining privacy concerns. 
Girls in the study were more likely to have a parent who accessed their online profiles. They were also 
more likely to have had a discussion with a parent about privacy settings.89 The findings suggest that 
children who have privacy discussions are more likely to have private profiles on social media. 
However, this does not affect how often they use social media. The children in the study who said that 
their parent knew their passwords were less likely to have a private profile. If we speculate, this may be 
because they are already very cautious about what they post online, knowing their parents will see it. 
Those who had discussions with teachers about social media safety and privacy settings were more 
likely to have a private profile. Approximately one half of the participants reported that they discussed 
the importance of privacy settings with parents (55 per cent), teachers (52 per cent) and peers (52 per 
cent). Privacy conversations with parents decrease with age, while discussions with peers increase. 
Other exploratory studies show that significant factors for children’s online privacy practices also 
include device use and digital literacy. Findings from a survey of 300 participants aged 11–25 years 
living in the capital region of the Philippines — which is again limited in generalizability — show that 
children who use more devices have better online privacy behaviours.90  The relationship is even 
stronger for children with better information literacy. However, another exploratory study looking at 
online privacy, digital literacy and actual exposure to online risks shows that digital skills may be less 
important than privacy concerns in driving privacy behaviours. This study comprised a survey 
conducted in Malaysia among 420 children aged 9–16 years.91 It shows that the participating children 
were less exposed to online risks when they were highly aware of the severity of online risks and had 
high online privacy concerns. 
These findings may be explained by a qualitative study with children and young people aged 14–18 
years. It shows that online privacy is perceived as likely to be infringed as children struggle to maintain 
the boundaries between different social circles (digital crowding) and to control how information about 
them travels (audience segregation).92 Despite this lack of informational privacy, there is an element of 
social or psychological privacy online. It is based on trust in others and expectations that personal 
information will be handled correctly. Hence, whether or not children are concerned about their privacy 
affects how they engage with the internet and deal with risky situations.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 The offline–online connection is explored in a survey with 1,644 children aged 10–16 years in China. It 
demonstrates the importance of differentiating between children with high and low levels of self-
disclosure, both online and offline. Children who use the online space as an extension of offline 
relationships and share information in a more balanced way (both offline and online) are more likely to 
experience positive outcomes and to show signs of resilience (low personal scores for neuroticism). 
When online self-disclosure occurs at the expense of offline self-disclosure, this tends to be associated 
with low personal scores for conscientiousness, agreeableness and extroversion and high scores for 
neuroticism.93 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  A lot of privacy research proceeds with adult definitions of privacy and does little to account for 
what children think and know about privacy. Paying attention to children’s definitions of privacy, 
or, more precisely, drawing connections between their definitions and the issues that adults are 
concerned about on children’s behalf, could help us to strengthen children’s privacy practices.
  In a previous piece of research,94 we emphasized that the majority of research concerns privacy in 
interpersonal contexts, with less attention paid to commercial or institutional contexts. Relatedly, 
most research conceives of data that are deliberately and knowingly provided, with fewer studies 
recognizing that data traces and inferred data (or metadata) also matter for children’s privacy. This 
evidence review found the same gaps and a lack of extensive measures of online privacy, which go 
beyond using privacy settings, having a public profile and sharing information with strangers. 
  More research is needed on the effect of skills on online privacy behaviours, particularly in relation 
to privacy strategies, values and behaviours, or peer pressure, which could inform peer training 
and empowerment methods.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 7 . RISK OF HARM ONLINE
The large majority of the studies identified by the review dealt with different aspects of online risk and 
harm. This review includes a total of 316 studies divided into sexual risks (70 studies), which are 
discussed in section 8, and non-sexual risks (246 studies). Of this latter set, 141 studies on excessive 
internet use, online gambling and excessive gaming were coded for research theme but excluded from 
further analysis and this report. 
The non-sexual risks reviewed include: 
  General or overall online risk exposure (14 studies)
  Seeing user-generated negative content (7 studies)
  Hurtful and bullying behaviour (81 studies)
  Cyber-hate, discrimination and violent extremism (3 studies)
Sexual risks include: 
  Receiving and sending sexual messages (30 studies)
  Viewing sexual content online (18 studies)
  Online sexual exploitation and abuse (22 studies) 
Each topic is defined and reviewed separately below.
7 .1. Online risk exposure 
Online risk covers exposure to a range of threats related to online: (1) content (child as a recipient of 
advertising content, spam, violent or hateful content, pornographic or unwanted sexual content); (2) 
contact (child as a participant in situations related to being bullied, harassed or stalked, receiving 
unwanted sexual messages, being groomed, meeting in person contacts first met online); and (3) 
conduct (child as an actor engaging in hacking, gambling, bullying or harassing behaviour, sending 
sexual material to others).95 Harm refers to the negative consequences some children experience from 
exposure to risks (e.g., feeling bothered or upset). Not all risks necessarily lead to harm and children 
can be affected differently by exposure to the same kind of risk.
The 14 sources, which for this report we allocated to the broader category of general risk, include 
survey-based, cross-sectional studies, with samples ranging from representative to small convenience 
samples. The geographical area covered by the studies goes beyond Europe and the United States to 
also include Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan Province of China, Thailand and Turkey. 
Key findings 
  Digital skills positively predict both online risks and online opportunities. Better digital literacy and 
safety skills are associated with more engagement not only in online opportunities but also in risky 
online activities.
95 (Hasebrink et al., 2009)35
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   Parental mediation can affect children’s exposure to risks but there is no combination of enabling 
and restrictive mediation that both increases opportunities and reduces risks. Reducing risks is 
always at the expense of opportunities. 
  The evidence on what types of risk lead to harm is insufficient. It is often assumed, rather than 
assessed, that exposure to risk leads to harm. There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks, 
vulnerability or support influence children’s exposure to online risk and subsequent feelings of 
harm, and the severity of that harm.
Many studies in the sample point out the interconnectedness of online risks with digital skills, online 
opportunities and parental mediation.96 A survey of 1,446 children aged 12–17 years in Spain found that 
the variation in children’s exposure to online risks is not explained much by their level of digital skills. 
The intuitive expectation that children with better skills experience fewer risks was not confirmed. The 
authors speculate that this may be due to the greater strength of other predictors, such as peer norms 
and pressure, sensation-seeking and offline victimization.97 
Similarly, a smaller-scale survey conducted in Malaysia among 420 children aged 9–16 years found that 
skills were less important for exposure to online risks than awareness of risks and privacy concerns.98 
The indicative findings suggest that children who think that the internet is risky and dangerous 
(perceived severity of an online risk) are less likely to encounter risks online. However, whether children 
think that they are likely to experience online risks (perceived susceptibility) does not affect how much 
they are exposed to online risk. The findings, limited in terms of generalizability, suggest two things: 
internet-related self-efficacy does not seem to reduce a child’s exposure to risk or affect privacy 
concerns; and greater digital literacy and safety skills are associated with riskier online activities, which 
may cause more harm. This suggests that digital literacy education needs to find new ways to build on 
children’s digital self-efficacy to ensure that risk exposure, or at least the experience of internet-related 
harms, is avoided or reduced.  
A few studies point to the protective effect of parental mediation on children’s exposure to risks.99 
However, the relationship between the two is complex. No combination of enabling and restrictive 
mediation has been found that both increases opportunities and reduces risks.100 A high-quality, cross-
national European study found that the maximum increase in opportunities occurs when parents 
engage in high enabling and low restrictive mediation. But this also increases risks. The maximum 
decrease in risks can be achieved by choosing a high level of restrictions but this will also result in the 
greatest reduction in opportunities.101 Restrictive mediation diminishes online risks through the 
reduction of digital skills and mostly at the expense of online opportunities.102 
Some studies found that active parental mediation is not significantly associated with exposure to 
online risk, while active mediation by teachers and peers can reduce risk.103 Parental and teacher

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 mediation also tends to focus more on making instructive remarks, such as talking about information 
management, while peers are more likely to engage in neutral types of active mediation, such as 
helping or recommending.104 The effects of parental mediation can also vary in different contexts. For 
example, active mediation is positively related with online risk exposure in  Turkey but not in European 
countries.105 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  A substantial gap in the research is the lack of attention paid to the differences between online 
risk and harm. Not all exposure to risk leads to harm and children are not equally affected. 
More evidence is needed on what types of risk lead to harm, what groups of children are more 
vulnerable, and what the long-term effects are on children’s development and well-being.
  There is little evidence on how children can build resilience and what protective factors exist. Is 
exposure to risk necessary for the development of resilience? What preventive strategies can be 
effective?
  There are also gaps in relation to how offline risks, vulnerability or support may influence children’s 
exposure to online risk and their experiences of harm. A more comprehensive model of online 
harm is needed, which explores how the relationship between antecedents and consequences is 
mediated by the online environment.
7 .2. Seeing negative content 
This refers to potentially negative, user-generated content. This includes websites or online discussions 
where people talk about or show images of physically harming or hurting themselves, committing 
suicide, ways to be very thin (such as being anorexic or bulimic), taking drugs, and gory or violent 
images. The reviewed studies focus mainly on the effects of negative content on children’s behaviour. 
Some aim to identify risk and protective factors. The online content considered includes sites 
advocating eating disorders, self-injury and suicide, or that involve exposure to violence. 
The seven studies use a variety of methodological approaches, from small qualitative research to large 
representative surveys, meta-analyses and evidence reviews. The survey-based studies are cross-
sectional and some use convenience samples. Geographically, they cover European countries and the 
United States. Bearing in mind the significant differences between the countries studied, the 
applicability of the findings to other contexts, particularly in the global South, needs to be established. 
Key findings 
  As a general pattern among the countries included here (primarily European countries and also 
the United States), it seems that older adolescents (aged 15–18 years) are more likely to access 
negative content than young adults (aged 19 years and over). Girls tend to be more likely to see 
eating disorder content, while boys are more likely to access pro-self-harm and pro-suicide content.
  It seems more common for children to engage in passive exposure, such as viewing violent 
content, than active engagement, such as liking or posting content. The evidence on how, where 
and why children come across this content is insufficient. 
104 (Shin and Lwin, 2017)
105 (Bayraktar, 2017)37
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   Lower levels of happiness with life, previous offline and online victimization, and lack of social 
support can increase children’s exposure to negative online content. 
  There are significant cross-country differences in children’s exposure to negative content. More 
analysis is needed on whether these differences are cultural, related to national policies and 
regulation, or related to other factors. 
  The interface and functionality of online platforms can make a difference. Image-based, anonymous 
and less moderated formats can facilitate the circulation of some user-generated negative content. 
  The evidence on protective factors is somewhat limited. Indicative findings suggest that happiness 
with life and social support can act as protective factors in relation to seeing negative content.
A few of the studies discuss prevalence of exposure to negative content. A survey of 3,567 respondents 
aged 15–30 years across Finland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States suggests that 
sites that advocate eating disorders, self-injury and suicide are familiar to children and young people. 
In all four countries, 13 per cent of respondents had seen self-injury or suicide sites or both, with 
exposure to both types of content more common than seeing only one type.106 The same study found 
that girls are more likely to see eating disorder content, while boys see more pro-self-harm and pro-
suicide content. Intentional self-harm, however, is more common among young females than young 
males. This may be explained by the fact that some boys may follow more violent content online. The 
younger participants, aged 15–18 years, were also more likely to access harm-advocating online 
content.107 There is some evidence that exposure to harmful content varies among online platforms (a 
study of black and Hispanic youth in the United States found that it was more common on Facebook 
than Instagram) and children usually experience passive exposure to it, such as seeing content, rather 
than active engagement, such as liking or posting content.108
A lower level of happiness and previous online and offline victimization experiences are also associated 
with exposure to such online material. Other risk factors relate to socio-demographic background 
variables such as not living with parents, migrant background and urban residence. The authors of the 
multi-country study conclude that “those facing difficulties in their everyday life are at higher risk of 
accessing online sites that may foster unhealthy behaviour” .109 However, the study found important 
cross-country differences. For example, exposure rates to all three types of harm-advocating material 
were significantly lower in Germany, possibly due to differences in regulation, digital ecology and the 
general mental health of the youth population.110 The different risk factors varied in significance in the 
different countries. 
Some studies unpack the extent to which engagement with the internet plays an important role. Using 
a higher number of social media and online services is associated with a higher risk of accessing 
harm-advocating online content; the frequency of online activity is not.111 Similarly, a qualitative study 
in Wales (in the United Kingdom) with a sample of 21 children and young people aged 16–24 years, 
with a history of self-harm, showed that the internet played an important part in participants’ self-harm

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 practices. The internet allows users to access information about self-harm, consume images or 
participate in online communities of self-harmers, which can normalize the practice. It also allows them 
to seek support.112 The participants discussed how seeing the images can provide a sense of satisfaction 
or create a desire to replicate them. Sharing of one’s own images was more likely to be linked to severe 
self-harm. Those who wanted to share their own images preferred more visual platforms, where 
posting is anonymous and less scrutinized or moderated. 
The evidence on protective factors is scarce and needs further research. It seems that happiness with 
life may be positively associated with a lower risk of accessing negative content online on topics such 
as self-injury and suicide. It also seems that social support can act as a protective factor.113 Friends can 
create a buffering effect for some young people. For others, closeness to family members is a 
substantial protective factor and living without parents is a risk factor.114 
7 .3. Hurtful and bullying behaviour
Hurtful behaviour online generally involves using digital technology and the internet to purposely share 
private information, photos or videos in a hurtful way, or sending threatening or insulting messages via 
email, instant messaging, chat or texts. It also includes spreading rumours and false information about 
the victim or purposely excluding them from online communications.115 Cyber-bullying is traditionally 
characterized by online harassment that is perpetrated repeatedly and involves a power imbalance 
between the perpetrator and victim.  The literature reviewed here did not always differentiate between 
hurtful online behaviour and bullying online. Bullying is not always operationalized online using the 
traditional defining features of repetition and power imbalance. Thus, this review includes online hurtful 
behaviour and cyber-bullying jointly, whether occurring repeatedly and involving a power imbalance or 
otherwise. Key findings are listed for each subsection. The limitations of the material and suggestions 
for future research are given at the end of each subsection.
7 .3.1. Cyber-bullying
This area of this theme produced some of the most extensive results, with more than 100 articles 
found. To narrow the results, the inclusion criteria were refined to include only survey-based research 
with higher-quality sampling. This reduced the sample to 72 studies, which were analysed and included 
in the review. Even among the 72 studies, the majority are cross-sectional and omit from their models 
the range of confounding variables previously shown to be significantly related to cyber-bullying or 
online hurtful behaviour. These include subjective well-being and social support. The majority of studies 
cover experiences of children in the global North (Australia, European countries and the United States) 
with a few focusing on Asian countries and Israel. 
Key findings
  Boys in the studies included here experience cyber-bullying mainly through video games and text 
messages. Girls experience it mainly through social media. Boys are also more likely than girls to 
be perpetrators or victims who also perpetrate bullying.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   Perpetrators of cyber-bullying are more likely to also be victims. Online and offline perpetration and 
victimization are also highly correlated.
  Cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization have common predictors. These include having 
weaker offline social ties and support from friends and family, loneliness, lower social likeability at 
school, lower psychological well-being, and having an impulsive personality. 
  Cyber-bullying victimization is associated with lower psychological well-being and externalizing 
behaviours.
  Protective factors in relation to cyber-bullying include a positive relationship with parents, parental 
monitoring of children’s activities (generally rather than online only), teacher care, enforced school 
rules, higher self-efficacy, self-confidence and resilience. 
The evidence suggests that boys and girls experience cyber-bullying differently, in terms of both 
perpetration and victimization.116 Overall, boys are more likely to be perpetrators or victim-perpetrators 
than girls,117 although this is not supported by all studies. Girls tend to be targeted more than boys for 
their appearance, weight or sexuality. They are also more likely to be the victims of gender-based 
harassment, exclusion and reputational damage.118 Boys and girls are targeted through different 
channels. Boys tend to be victimized through video games and mobile phone text messages. Girls are 
more likely to experience cyber-bullying through social media.119 
There is a strong correlation between cyber-bullying victimization and perpetration, as well as between 
online and offline perpetration and victimization.120 Accordingly, there are several common predictors 
of both cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization. These include having weaker offline social ties 
and support from friends and family, loneliness, lower social likeability at school, lower psychological 
well-being, and having an impulsive personality (e.g., lack of self-control).121 While cross-sectional 
studies show that a high level of activity on social networking sites is a predictor of cyber-bullying 
victimization and perpetration, a longitudinal study in Germany demonstrated a reverse relationship. It 
showed that more frequent mobile and internet use was an outcome of cyber-bullying victimization and 
perpetration.122 
Other risk factors associated with online bullying and harassment perpetration include lower self-
efficacy and empathy, higher self-perceived popularity, the need for popularity, and the perception of 
high violence in a child’s neighbourhood.123 Being the target of cyber-bullying is associated with having 
a physical or developmental disability, living with a single parent, a perceived poor school 
environment, and social anxiety, such as a fear of negative evaluation from peers, and social avoidance

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 and distress. A range of risk behaviours is also associated with cyber-bullying victimization. This 
includes use of alcohol or drugs at school, an affiliation with gangs involving violence, and engaging in 
risky internet behaviours, such as publishing personal information on social networks.124 
The evidence on the role of parental mediation in cyber-bullying is inconclusive. While some studies 
found a significant association between parental control and supervision of children’s online activities 
and lower cyber-bullying perpetration and victimization, others found no significant relationship. One 
study even shows that parental mediation predicts a higher likelihood of victimization.125 The studies 
that found a significant relationship show that the positive effect of parental control is mediated by less 
time spent online and decreased engagement in risky behaviours online.126 On the other hand, there is 
emerging evidence that what is important are children’s overall relationships with their parents and the 
monitoring of children’s activities in general rather than of their online activities in particular.127 
Looking at factors that can protect children from becoming victims of cyber-bullying besides parental 
mediation, researchers found a significant impact of teacher care, the presence of established and 
enforced school rules, higher self-efficacy, self-confidence, subjective well-being and resilience. 
Examples of resilience include the ability to tolerate experiences such as change, personal problems, 
illness, pressure, failure and painful feelings.128 Studies where cyber-bullying victimization was used as 
a predictor identified several negative outcomes among victims, including the internalization of 
problems, lower subjective well-being, suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety (including stress), lower 
self-esteem, physical symptoms, emotional problems and actual suicide attempts.129 
One study showed that the most distressing incidents for children are those that involve both in-person 
and online elements, multiple perpetrators, and a power imbalance between the victim and perpetrator. 
Children in this study found technology-only harassment less distressing.130 Mixed incidents, which 
occur both online and offline, are more likely to involve repeated harassment and current or past 
friends or romantic partners as perpetrators. This points to the potential importance of perpetrator 
identity in determining the negative impact of cyber-bullying.131 
Cyber-bullying victimization is also associated with a long list of externalizing behaviours. These 
include self-harm (online and offline), substance use, viewing web content related to suicide and 
self-harm, and more frequent mobile or internet use. They may also involve social problems or peer 
problems, for example, children thinking that their peers do not like them. Externalizing behaviours can 
also encompass problems with academic achievement and behavioural problems, such as getting into 
fights, damaging property, and defiant behaviour.132

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 7 .3.2. Cyber-bystanders
A cyber-bystander is someone who has observed or witnessed cyber-bullying but was not its main 
perpetrator or victim. Witnesses to bullying can take different roles. They can act as assistants to the 
bully by following the main perpetrator and participating in bullying. They can reinforce the bully by 
watching and laughing at the victim. They can defend the victim, interfering to protect or comfort the 
victim. Or they can act as outsiders, who observe but do not engage in any way.133 
Key findings
  More children are bystanders of cyber-bullying than bullies or victims. There are conflicting age and 
gender patterns in predicting cyber-bystanding across different countries.
  Whether bystanders intervene or remain outsiders depends on their own and the victim’s gender, 
as well as their relationship with the perpetrator and the victim. 
  Bystanders of cyber-bullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of 
responsibility than those who witness bullying in person at school. 
  Being a witness of cyber-bullying – even if not a perpetrator or a victim – can have an adverse effect 
on children’s quality of life over time. 
We found nine studies on the topic of cyber-bystanding, mainly from Australia and European countries, 
with one study from the Islamic Republic of Iran and another from Israel. With a couple of exceptions, 
most studies use convenience sampling and correlational analyses. Overall, there is a higher 
proportion of cyber-bystanders than cyber-bullies or cyber-victims among children.134 Gender seems to 
be a predictor of cyber-bystanding in some countries but not in others. Girls are significantly more 
likely than boys to be cyber-bystanders in Australia, the Islamic Republic of Iran and Spain, and among 
Jewish adolescents in Israel. But there is no difference by gender among Arab adolescents in Israel, 
and in the Republic of Korea.135 One study136 found that girls in Spain are more likely to witness specific 
types of cyber-bullying, including sexual harassment, online defamation and rumours, insulting calls, 
and dissemination of videos or photos. 
With regard to the behaviours of cyber-bystanders, the gender of the observer (and the victim of 
cyber-bullying) is an important factor.137 Girls are more likely to take the role of defender of the victim,138 
while their male peers are more likely not to interfere.139 A 2018 study in Germany of 486 schoolchildren 
aged 10–16 years found that, compared with boys, girls are more empathetic, have a higher sense of 
responsibility and perceive more negative outcomes from cyber-bystanding. Boys are more likely to 
report feelings of moral disengagement.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Children who have larger online friendship networks are more likely to witness cyber-bullying, 
according to a study on Australia and the Republic of Korea.140 Offline friendship networks are a 
significant predictor of cyber-bystanding in the Republic of Korea, but not in Australia. According to 
another study, age is a significant predictor of witnessing cyber-bullying in Colombia, but not in Spain 
or Uruguay.141 That same study showed that being an assistant to the bully was more common among 
younger children aged 10–12 years than among young people aged 15–18 years. 
Two recent studies in Australia found that an important predictor of whether a young person intervenes 
to help the victim is their relationship with the perpetrator and/or the victim.142 In a qualitative study, 
children mentioned that it was difficult to identify an interaction as cyber-bullying or to know its 
harmful intentions and consequences to the target because of the vague nature of online 
communications.143 Thus, knowing the people involved is important for children to know how to react 
and whether to intervene. This is confirmed in the German study, which compared the emotional 
processes underlying the behaviour of witnesses to offline and online bullying. According to this study, 
bystanders of cyber-bullying display higher moral disengagement and lower feelings of responsibility 
than those who witness bullying in person at school. They also perceive lower negative outcomes and 
lower self-efficacy than bystanders of school bullying. However, there was no difference in feelings of 
empathy between bystanders to cyber-bullying and school bullying. A study in the Islamic Republic of 
Iran found no association between emotional intelligence and cyber-bullying roles, including cyber-
bystanding.144
Only one study looked at the effect of cyber-bystanding on children longitudinally. It shows that cyber-
bystanders score higher on all dimensions of quality of life compared with cyber-victims and cyber-
bullies. Still, the quality of life of cyber-bystanders falls significantly over time (after five months), even 
when they have never been a perpetrator or a victim of cyber-bullying.145 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  Despite the significant amount of research on cyber-bullying, there is no unified definition or 
measurement for bullying. For example, some studies define bullying as involving repeated 
occurrences, while others measure one or more incidents as bullying. Similarly, the measurement 
of cyber-bystanding varies — some studies include only cases where children have directly 
witnessed cyber-bullying, while others also include cases that children have only heard about or 
are aware of. This affects the interpretation of the findings from individual studies and the ability 
to draw more generalizable conclusions about cyber-bullying, its incidence, effects and protective 
factors. 
  Very few studies of cyber-bullying investigate the relationship between victims and perpetrators 
and the implications of a possible power imbalance; only two studies did so, finding that victims 
experience higher distress levels.146 Hence, it is important to better understand the circumstances 
within which cyber-bullying occurs.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   More longitudinal studies are needed to shed some light on causality and long-term outcomes. 
The majority of recent studies look at predictors, but there seems to be much less research on the 
potential effect of cyber-bullying and cyber-bystanding on children’s well-being, for example.
  Many studies omit important individual- and environmental-level covariates that have proven to 
be significantly related to online bullying and harassment experiences in previous research. These 
covariates include subjective well-being and social support. Integrating children’s experiences of 
offline risks and protective factors with online risk experiences may be useful in developing more 
comprehensive models to understand cyber-bullying.
  The studies reviewed do not always distinguish between cyber-bullying and cyber-bystanding. It 
is not always clear whether participants can indicate their adoption of multiple roles, for example, 
being a cyber-bully as well as a cyber-bystander. 
7 .4. Cyber-hate, discrimination and violent extremism
Cyber-hate is the use of digital technology to profess attitudes devaluing others because of their 
religion, race, ethnicity, sex or gender, sexual orientation, national origin or some other characteristic.147 
It is a distinct form of cyber-violence because it targets individuals based on their collective identity and 
belonging to a group rather than based on their unique individuality. 
We found only two studies148 that address cyber-hate, one comparing the United States and Finland, 
and another based only in the United States. We found none on violent extremism. Both studies use an 
online survey and mix children with young adults in their research. One is based on a larger survey, 
while the other includes quite specific groups (ethnic minority from lower socio-economic backgrounds 
or having a history of self-harm).
Key findings 
  Cyber-hate materials usually pertain to group stereotyping, blaming or advocating hate based on 
race, sexual orientation, religion, nationality or immigration status, sex or gender, and politics.
  There is some indicative evidence that greater online exposure to hate material may vary based on 
differences in internet use, including the platforms used and the time spent online. It may also vary 
based on user characteristics, such as younger age, migrant background or country of residence, 
as well as some offline factors, such as lower levels of happiness, life satisfaction and trust in 
government.
  The evidence gaps in this area are substantial and relate not only to prevalence, but also to risk and 
vulnerable groups, and most of all to protective factors.
The study based in the United States only used an online survey, with a sample of 1,034 internet users 
aged 15–36 years. The survey produced demographically balanced panel data.149  The researchers found 
that the majority of their sample had seen or heard hate material online in the previous three months. 
147 (Costello et al., 2016: 312).
148 New publications that came out after the literature search was completed show large variations of cyber-hate exposure between 
countries (Machackova et al., 2020). Increases in witnessing online hate are positively related to being a perpetrator of online hate 
(Wachs et al., 2020). Girls tend to use strategies for coping with online hate more often than boys. Younger teenagers more often use 
technical strategies than older teenagers (Wachs et al., 2020). 
149 (Costello et al., 2016)44
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 In almost half of the cases, the material pertained to group stereotypes, followed by material blaming a 
group for the nation’s problems or advocating hate towards a group, and material that called for 
violence or discrimination. Mostly, online hate pertained to race, sexual orientation, religion, nationality 
or immigration status, sex or gender, and politics.150 The respondents were most likely to encounter 
hate material on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, the three most commonly used platforms. 
Other risk factors include time spent online, age, origin and ethnicity, and trust in government. Each 
additional hour spent online increases the likelihood of seeing or hearing hate material. But spending 
more than three hours a day online reduces this likelihood. This suggests both that those who view 
hate material online are likely to come upon it shortly after accessing the internet and that users who 
spend more time online tend to avoid hate material. Individuals who distrust government are more 
inclined to view websites disseminating hate material. The same is true for those from a white or 
Hispanic background and people with at least one parent born outside of the United States. Exposure 
to hate material decreases with age. The study found no relation between exposure to cyber-hate and 
risk-taking, closeness to friends and family offline, gender or geographical location. 
The second study was a slightly younger online sample of 1,014 individuals in the United States and 
555 individuals in Finland aged 15–30 years. It found that exposure to online hate was more frequent in 
the United States compared with Finland. This was explained by the greater ethnic diversity and focus 
on freedom of speech in the United States. The study found that people exposed to online hate were 
less satisfied with their lives and less happy in general. This is possibly a bidirectional relationship, 
according to the authors. “Exposure leads to less well-being; this can, in turn, lead to greater 
exposure, ” the study reports, “If this is the case, higher levels of exposure could be the result of a 
vicious cycle. ”151 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  The fact that we were able to identify only two cyber-hate studies suggests that more evidence is 
needed in this area, particularly on violent extremism. Understanding the consequences of mere 
exposure compared to active engagement (posting, liking) may be particularly important.
  Another substantial gap relates to the lack of evidence on actual harm to children and the long-term 
effects. Both of the studies discuss associations between different risk factors but can say very little 
about harm or causality, particularly in relation to more durable outcomes for children’s well-being. 
  While the publications discuss a range of background characteristics, the evidence on protective 
factors is particularly patchy. Future research should consider the potentially wide range of factors 
that could be examined in relation to children’s access to cyber-hate and violent extremism content.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 8. SEXUAL ACTIVITIES AND RISKS ONLINE
8.1. Viewing or exchanging sexual content
Children’s online sexual activities are mainly researched in terms of the exchange of sexual material in 
relation to a range of activities, such as cyber-sex, exchanging sexualized content (sexting), chatting 
about sex, or seeking sexual partners online.152 The recent literature reviewed here, however, is 
dominated by research on sexting.
8.1.1. Exchanging sexual content (sexting) 
Sexting is defined as sending, r eceiving or exchanging self-produced sexualized content. This 
includes images, messages or videos sent or received through mobile phones, the internet or 
both.153 Sexting can be a positive experience and a normal part of teenagers’ exploration of 
sexuality and relationships. While it may be done among consenting children, it may still place 
them at risk. Sending or receiving sexual content can be non-consensual, including as a result of 
coercion, receiving unwanted sexual content through sexual bullying or harassment, or sharing 
someone else’s content without the person’s consent.154 
We reviewed 21 studies on sexting. The overwhelming majority were conducted with children in 
European countries and the United States. Most of the studies are quantitative. They are 
predominantly cross-sectional, including large convenience samples of more than 500 people, 
and controlling only for demographic characteristics. Only five studies can be considered 
methodologically robust, with representative samples and adequate covariates or longitudinal 
design. 
Key findings
  The factors that predict a higher likelihood of sexting behaviour among children include gender 
(male), age (older), sexuality (LGBTQI) and socio-economic status (low).
  Girls are more likely than boys to receive and be asked for sexts from strangers, to have negative 
sexting experiences, and to be vulnerable to coercive sexting victimization. 
  Most studies conceptualize sexting as deviant behaviour and do not acknowledge that it can be a 
positive experience for teenagers who want to explore their sexuality and relationships. Harm is 
often assumed, rather than assessed. 
  One of the main limitations of the literature on children’s online sexual activities is the absence of 
relationship context in studying these interactions. Many studies do not ask children about their 
relationship with their sexting or cyber-sex partners, which precludes a nuanced understanding 
of these interactions. This is an important limitation, given the evidence on differential outcomes 
depending on the identity of children’s sexting or cyber-sex partners. 
  Psychological problems, reduced online safety and privacy, online sexual solicitations by adults, 
and offline risks (such as sexual interactions with adults and dating violence) are all associated with 
sexting.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Gender, age, sexuality and socio-economic status are among the factors that predict sexting 
behaviour among children. Studies find that boys, non-heterosexual children, older teenagers and 
children from a lower socio-economic background are more likely to engage in sexting.155  
However, there is evidence that girls are more likely to be asked for sexts, to receive sexts from 
strangers156 and to have more negative sexting experiences.157 Girls are also more vulnerable to 
coercive sexting victimization158 and to having their self-produced sexual content sent to other 
people without their consent.159 Boys and older children aged 14–15 years are more likely to 
coerce a partner to send messages with sexual content than girls aged 11–12 years.160 
Sexting practices are shaped by broader gender and cultural contexts. One study found that girls 
in the Netherlands (but not boys) who uploaded sexualized pictures of themselves on social 
media were more likely to engage in sexting than those who did not.161 This is related to their 
sexual self-concept of being sexually mature and efficacious and is moderated by their level of 
extroversion and the volume of sexual media they consume.162 
Qualitative research with children further highlights the gendered nature of the risk that comes 
with sexting. Boys are culturally perceived as entitled to take pleasure in viewing sexual (nude) 
images of girls as a way of fitting in with their peers.163 On the other hand, the unauthorized 
distribution of nude images of girls has a more damaging impact on the girls’ reputations, leading 
to them being stigmatized or “slut-shamed” .164 Children often place the responsibility for mitigating 
the risk from sexting on the person sending the sexts, especially when this is a girl .165 
Predictors of sexting among children include having a romantic partner166 and trusting the person 
they are sexting .167 Sexting is also associated with having an extroverted, less agreeable and less 
conscientious personality type, as well as with higher levels of neuroticism , especially depression, 
impulsiveness and vulnerability to stress.168 Two studies , conducted with representative samples in 
Australia and in 25 European countries, found that children who sext are more likely to have 
emotional problems,169 as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviours ,170 even though framing sexting 
as a deviant and necessarily harmful behaviour was criticized by the researchers, who see sexting 
as a normal part of the teenage exploration of sexuality and relationships.171

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 The Australian study examines a range of covariates, including time spent on the internet, cyber-
bullying, perceived social support, digital literacy, and information and communications 
technology safety skills. There is some indicative evidence on possible longer-term negative 
effects from a longitudinal study with a convenience sample of about 600 children. It shows that 
sending sexts predicts a decrease in positive emotions one year later. This is without controlling 
for whether the initial sexting experience was positive or negative.172 
Aspects of the digital context can also be related to sexting behaviour. A representative study in 
the United States173 found that receiving sexts was positively linked to using a phone during 
school hours, and negatively associated with being on a family mobile phone plan and going to a 
school that supervises the use of phones. Some studies found a positive relationship between 
children’s sexting and late-night internet use,174 disclosure of personal information online, talking to 
people they first met online ,175 and regular viewing of online pornography .176 In terms of online safety 
and privacy, children who sext are less likely to have preventive privacy behaviours . They are less 
careful with what they post online and more likely to give out personal information like their real 
name, home address and phone number.177 
Children’s engagement in sexting is also related to their experiences offline. Some studies 
show a connection to other risk-taking behaviours, both sexual and non-sexual. This means that 
some children live in a culture of higher risk-taking. Children who send sexts are more likely to 
engage in other risk-taking behaviours, such as increased alcohol consumption,178 having more 
sexual experiences, having their first sexual interaction at a younger age, and having unsafe 
sex.179 However, the relationship between sexual intercourse and sexting is only significant for younger 
boys (but not girls) aged 11–14 years and for adolescents aged 15–18 years.180 The relationship 
context within which sexting occurs is important for some outcomes . A study in Belgium of 1,187 
students aged 16–22 years shows that the positive relationship between sexting and lifetime 
substance use and heavy drinking is only significant among children who send sexts to people 
other than their romantic partners.181 
Receiving and sending sexts is related to online sexual solicitations and having sexual interactions 
with adults, such as sending sexual content or meeting offline for sexual contact.182 It is also 
related to cyber-bullying victimization and perpetration.183 However, a longitudinal study of 624 
students aged 12–19 years in Galicia, Spain, found that sending sexts predicted a decrease in 
victimization in general, such as being hit, insulted or threatened, but did not find a significant 
relationship with cyber-bullying victimization.184 Moreover, there is a positive relationship between

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 the exchange of sexts and dating-violence perpetration and victimization,185 as well as  with 
experiencing interpersonal violence and abuse within children’s intimate relationships. Examples 
of interpersonal violence include face-to-face, emotional, physical and sexual violence.186 
8.1.2. Viewing sexual content online
Viewing sexual content online includes exposure to pictures or videos of sexually explicit material, 
such as nudity and people having sex, including pornography. Pornography for this review is 
specifically defined as sexually explicit media intended for sexual arousal. While most studies test 
children’s intentional exposure to sexually explicit material online, a few also include a measure of 
accidental exposure. 
Eighteen studies in our review looked at viewing sexual content online. The majority are from European 
countries. Studies mainly use large convenience samples, with only demographic control variables and 
cross-sectional designs. 
Key findings 
  Children view sexual content online to learn about sex but tend to see men’s dominance and 
violent behaviours against women. Boys are more likely than girls to view such content. 
  Children who are more interested in sex are also more likely to view sexual content online. They are 
also more likely to have experiences of risky sexual activities, such as casual sex, sexual sensation-
seeking and exposure to unwanted sexual solicitation. This suggests multiple vulnerabilities and 
risk of harm for some children. 
In the studies reviewed here, boys had greater exposure than girls to sexual content online,  as is 
the case with other online sexual activities.187 Children who view sexual content online tend to 
believe that they can learn something from it and are more likely to view online pornography. 
They are more likely to engage in other sex-related activities, such as casual sex or engaging in 
sexual sensation-seeking. They are also more prone to have instrumental attitudes towards sex, 
meaning that they perceive sex as a core instrument for sexual gratification, and to be exposed to 
unwanted sexual solicitation. They are more apt to meet face to face with someone they first got 
to know online.188 
Several factors, both internet-related and not, mediate some of these relationships. For example, 
viewing sexual content online is related to sexual sensation-seeking, especially for those children 
who engage in online sexual activities more frequently, as well as those who think that internet 
pornography has more damaging effects on others than on themselves.189 Viewing sexual content 
is related to sexting for children who have higher alcohol consumption.190

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 A study in Australia that explored the content children are exposed to when watching sexual 
content online revealed that significantly more children see men’s pleasure, men’s dominance and 
men’s violent behaviours against women than vice versa.191 It also found that girls are more likely 
than boys to recognize violence against women in pornography.192 These findings are concerning , 
given the evidence that children use pornography to learn about sex.193 Still, the findings explain 
the association s, among boys, between viewing pornography and having sexually aggressive 
behaviour and holding negative gender attitudes.194 
There is much less evidence on protective factors and outcomes in relation to viewing sexual 
content online. Support from parents or friends, but not teachers, seems to provide a buffer 
against the negative effect of sexually aggressive behaviour, associated with viewing online 
pornography.195 There is no evidence that parental use of internet filtering successfully protects 
children from encountering sexual content online.196 There are also significant gaps in terms of 
outcomes. One study found no direct relationship between viewing online pornography and its 
impact on mental health outcomes, once the consequences of general internet use are taken into 
account. These consequences include sleep loss and withdrawal when the internet  is 
inaccessible .197 
Limitations and suggestions for further research 
 Children’s engagement with digitally mediated sexual activities, such as sexting or viewing 
sexual content online, need to be studied in the context of children’s intimacy, partner 
relationships, and desire to learn about sex. These practices must be understood within 
the cultures of teenage sociality that both encourage and regulate the exchange of sexual 
material.
 Future research needs to reflect more closely how children perceive online sexual activities 
and to remain open to the possibility that for some, such activities are beneficial. Studying 
online sexual activities as deviant and harmful behaviours does not correspond with the 
experiences of all children. 
 Another limitation at present relates to the different ways in which studies operationalize 
sexting, with some studies looking only at sending sexts or only at receiving sexts. This 
creates a partial picture of the predictors and outcomes of different types of sexting. For 
example, it is not clear why some children are more likely to receive than send sexts. 
 An area that needs further exploration is the motivations and outcomes of different types of 
sexting, especially the sharing of sexts of others without their consent. 
 With regard to the evidence on viewing sexual content, future studies should link the content 
that children see online to outcomes. Currently, issues of content and outcomes are studied

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 separately. Studies should also distinguish between accidental and intentional viewing of 
sexual content online, and the different kinds of sexual content that children may be exposed 
to. Finally, more evidence is needed on the impact of viewing sexual content online on 
children’s well-being in general. 
 Overall, there is a lack of clarity regarding the protective role of social support from 
family and friends in relation to patterns of children’s online sexual activities and their 
outcomes. Studies have not  found  that family support reduces the likelihood of children 
sending a sext to strangers, nor that parents’ use of internet filtering decreases children’s 
exposure to sexual content online. Nonetheless, there is evidence that parental and friend 
support can act as a buffer against the negative effects of viewing online pornography, 
including against sexually aggressive behaviour. Parental discussions with children about 
online privacy settings also reduce the risk of sexting. This calls for a closer investigation into 
the impact of different forms of social support on children’s online sexual activities. 
8.2. Sexual exploitation and abuse online
We define online sexual exploitation and abuse as including all acts of child sexual abuse, child 
prostitution, production or dissemination of child sexual abuse materials, child corruption (the 
intentional causing, for sexual purposes, of a child, to witness sexual abuse or sexual activities) and 
solicitation of children for sexual purposes.198 These acts can take place virtually but can be preceded or 
accompanied by or can develop into exploitation offline. 
We identified 22 studies on online sexual exploitation and abuse.199 They generally focus on prevalence, 
predictors, and risk and protective factors. The majority of studies were conducted in European 
countries, with a smaller number in the United States and in countries of East and Southeast Asia. Most 
often, these studies include older teenagers. Children under 12 years of age are generally missing from 
the evidence base. Some studies conflate children with young adults. The studies vary in the extent to 
which they operate within the parameters of our definition of online sexual exploitation and abuse. 
Our search yielded no studies on children exploited in/for prostitution, child sexual abuse materials or 
child corruption. There are variations in relation to who the perpetrator is and how the child regards the 
interaction. For example, some studies specify that the perpetrator is an adult. Others also include 
peers or strangers, without asking about age. Some research asks children about only unwanted sexual 
experiences, while other studies leave this open. This makes it challenging at times to identify the 
precise definition used in the research and to establish comparability of findings.
Key findings
  Online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to a combination of factors related to three areas, 
namely the digital context (online activities and skills), child-related factors (gender, age, well-
being, offline risks) and the social context (factors related to family, peers and community).
  Children who are more vulnerable offline, perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have 
less protection and support, are also more vulnerable online.
198 (Council of Europe, 2012)
199 For a review of the evidence on child sexual exploitation and abuse see also Radford et al. (2015) and UNICEF (2020).51
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   Online victimization can create real risks for the offline victimization of children. Being asked to do 
something sexual online is a strong predictor of children meeting in person, for sexual purposes, 
an adult they first got to know online. 
In assessing the risk factors, the studies mainly focus on three areas. The first is the digital context, 
which covers children’s online activities and, occasionally, skills. The second area deals with child-
related factors, such as gender and age, well-being and offline behaviour, for example, sensation-
seeking, risk-taking and experiences of violence. The third is the social context, which covers factors 
related to family, peers and community. An overall conclusion, supported by all 22 studies, is that 
online sexual exploitation and abuse are linked to a combination of factors across all three areas, but 
that children who are more vulnerable offline, perhaps because they are exposed to violence and have 
less protection and support, are also more vulnerable online. 
Children who are at a higher risk of victimization tend to be female, older teenagers, LGBTQI children 
and children from ethnic minority backgrounds. They are also more likely to have experienced other 
forms of online and offline violence, to lack social support and to engage in risky online behaviour, such 
as posting personal information or pictures online and chatting to strangers. Factors not significantly 
related to online sexual exploitation and abuse include children’s self-esteem, the number of people on 
their contact lists, and the use of and length of time spent on social networking sites.200 We explore this 
further in relation to specific types of online sexual exploitation and abuse. 
There is a range of protective factors identified in this literature in relation to online sexual exploitation 
and abuse, including enabling parental mediation, help-seeking and the ability to recognize violence in 
personal relationships. For a better understanding of the incidence and impact of child sexual 
exploitation and abuse, we need to acknowledge the interconnection of children’s existing 
vulnerabilities, both online and offline, and the presence of protective factors, at both the individual 
and social level. Below, we examine the evidence on online sexual solicitation, sextortion and cyber-
dating violence.
8.2.1. Sexual solicitation online
Sexual solicitation, also referred to as ‘grooming’, denotes the process of establishing a relationship 
with a child either in person or through the use of information and communication technologies to 
facilitate online or offline sexual contact.201 Online sexual solicitation refers to requests to a child to 
share personal sexual information or engage in sexual activities or sexual talk through digital 
technologies.
This topic yielded  the most evidence of all topics in the area of online sexual exploitation and abuse, a 
total of 15 publications. Most of the research is quantitative, using school-based survey methods and 
(cluster or stratified) random sampling. In four cases, convenience sampling was used. One study used 
an online panel.202 Most of the research is cross-sectional, except for one longitudinal study in Taiwan 
Province of China.203 However, even when the studies use large samples overall, drilling down to sexual 
solicitation victims produces small samples.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Only one of the studies in our sample is qualitative, in that it uses focus groups.204 One study includes 
young adults but was retained as it is retrospective and covers the pre-adulthood period.205 
Geographically, the research covers Asia (India, Japan, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan 
Province of China and Thailand), Europe (Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and 
the United Kingdom) and the United States.
Key findings 
  Girls and older teenagers are more likely to be victims of online sexual solicitation, according to 
most studies (but there are exceptions). 
  Being subjected to online sexual solicitation is associated with online risk behaviours, including 
exposure to online pornography, posting personal information or pictures online, having unknown 
people as friends on social media, voluntary sexting, video chatting with strangers, time spent 
online on weekdays (but not on weekends), and high levels of gaming. 
  There is a connection between being vulnerable offline and online. Online sexual solicitation 
is correlated with offline exposure to violence, neglect, physical punishment, psychological 
victimization, parental conflict, sexual harassment and sexual solicitation. 
  Perpetrators are a mixture of strangers and people known to the child. Perpetrators of online sexual 
solicitation are less likely to be known to the child than perpetrators of face-to-face sexual abuse. 
  Social support can act as a protective factor. Children who lack such social resources face a double 
disadvantage: they are more likely to experience online sexual solicitation and less likely to seek 
help.
The publications indicated that 12 to 17 per cent of those surveyed had been subjected to sexual 
solicitations by an adult, and 13 to 28 per cent had received unwanted sexual solicitations, regardless 
of the age of the perpetrator. The differences are likely to be related to both methodological approaches 
and country specificities. The majority of the studies in the review found that girls experience online 
sexual solicitation (unwanted or not specified) more often than boys, including in Ireland, Italy, Spain, 
Sweden and the United Kingdom.206 But in some contexts, such as Taiwan Province of China, boys are 
more likely than girls to experience online sexual solicitation.207 In Malaysia, both genders are equally 
likely to be subjected to online sexual solicitation,208 and boys are sometimes found to be more likely 
than girls to be perpetrators of unwanted sexual solicitation.209 
A few studies explore how sexual solicitation experiences vary by children’s age. There is some 
evidence from two studies in Spain210 which suggests that age is an important factor. This research 
found that children aged 15–17 years were significantly more likely to receive requests to engage in 
sexual activities or in sexual talk, or to give out personal sexual information than their younger peers

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 aged 12–13 years. Age and gender were also found to be important factors by a German study with 
children aged 14–17 years, which looked at their online sexual interactions with adults and peers. These 
interactions included having a sexual conversation, exchanging pictures, and cyber-sex.211 The study 
found that half (51 per cent) of children had engaged in some type of online sexual activity. While this 
activity mostly involved peers, about one in five children in this study had had a sexual interaction with 
an adult. Of the children who engage in online sexual activities, about one in five have experiences of 
being solicited for sexual purposes. Overall, only 6 per cent of their sexual interactions with peers and 
10 per cent of such interactions with adults are perceived as negative. This study found that the children 
experiencing online sexual solicitation were more likely to be girls, older teenagers, gay or bisexual, 
not living with both parents, of a foreign nationality and lacking in social support.212 
The majority of studies do not ask children about their relationship with the person soliciting them. It 
can be concluded from recent evidence that the perpetrators are a mixture of strangers and people 
known to the child. A study conducted in Cyprus with 1,852 children and young adults aged 15–25 years 
found that in cases of online sexual solicitation the perpetrator was less likely to be known to the 
individual than in cases of face-to-face sexual abuse.213 A Spanish study with a younger sample of 2,731 
children aged 12–15 years showed that in two thirds of online solicitation cases, children first met their 
perpetrator online.214
That same study found that two thirds of the children who engaged in sexual interactions with adults 
reported the use of some form of persuasion strategy by their perpetrator.215 The study tested three 
persuasion techniques used by adults in the sexual solicitation of children: deception, meaning to 
pretend to be someone else; bribery, defined as offering money or gifts; and the formation of a non-
sexual emotional relationship.216 It found that online sexual solicitations, such as requests by an adult 
for a child to send sexual pictures or videos or to engage in cyber-sex, were associated with the use of 
deception and bribery. Sexual interactions, for example, where children agree to send an adult sexual 
pictures or videos of themselves or to meet an adult offline to have sexual contact, are related to the 
formation of a non-sexual emotional relationship.217 This means that children may be groomed to 
develop feelings of closeness and intimacy with the adult perpetrator, which can then lead directly to 
sexual interaction and abuse, without the mediation of sexual solicitation. 
A study in Malaysia of 3,349 children aged 12–17 years218 shows that slightly more than half of the 
children who were in contact with an unknown person online were invited to a face-to-face meeting 
and that 59 per cent of these children went to this meeting. Nearly one third of the children reported 
that the person they met was an adult who posed as a minor. More than half of the children who met 
people they first got to know online went to the meeting alone and had met more than six people 
(separately). Boys are more likely to meet people face to face, as are children who go online in internet 
cafés, view pornography online and disclose personal information on the internet. Not being explicitly

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 forbidden by parents to meet strangers or to use certain websites and chat rooms also increases the 
likelihood of meeting people offline. Of the 1,005 children who said they had met a person they first got 
to know online, 5.5 per cent reported that they had been assaulted, either sexually or physically. More 
than half of these children experienced multiple types of assaults. Forced sexual intercourse was 
reported by 18 respondents in the study (13 males, 5 females).219 
Several studies explore the role of children’s online activities in relation to the experience of online 
sexual solicitation. A longitudinal study in Taiwan Province of China shows that higher levels of online 
gaming, exposure to online pornography, posting personal information or pictures online, and chatting 
to strangers via a webcam are associated with a higher likelihood of exposure to an unwanted sexual 
solicitation.220 Sexual solicitation is also significantly associated with having unknown people on a list 
of social networking friends, voluntary sexting, instant messaging or using video chat, and time spent 
online on weekdays (but not on weekends).221 Comparing children who are only solicited for sexual 
purposes with those who are also involved in a sexual interaction with an adult — meaning that they 
sent sexual photos or videos of themselves or met face to face with an adult they previously met online 
— the latter are more likely than the former to have played online games, to have used chat and to 
have met new people online.222 Other risk factors include perpetration of online harassment and 
aggression.223 Being asked to do something sexual online is a strong predictor of a child meeting in 
person, for sexual purposes, an adult they first got to know online.224 
There is a connection between being vulnerable offline and online. Children who are exposed offline to 
sexual harassment, solicitation, bullying (among boys) and parental conflict are also more likely to be 
victims of online sexual solicitation. Both physical sexual abuse and online sexual solicitation are 
significantly correlated with exposure to violence, neglect, physical punishment and psychological 
victimization. However, children experiencing both types of sexual abuse do not experience higher 
odds of these outcomes than those experiencing only one of them.225 A study of 1,852 children and 
young people aged 15–25 years living in Cyprus found that those from urban areas and those whose 
father’s educational level was lower were more likely to report online sexual solicitation and physical 
abuse.226 The vicious cycle continues, as children who have experienced online solicitation are then 
more likely to experience sexual violence and abuse offline.227 
There is very little research on the effects of sexual solicitation on children. Depressive symptoms are 
significantly positively associated with online sexual solicitation, according to studies with children in 
Spain and Taiwan Province of China,228 but this association was found only among girls in Sweden.229

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Low levels of help-seeking (reporting experiences of illicit solicitation to friends, parents or a helpline) 
are associated with higher rates of online sexual solicitation.230 Children who have stronger social 
support from parents and friends231 are more likely to show protective behaviour and seek help after 
experiencing online sexual solicitation. Children who have been involved in risky behaviour offline, 
such as intoxication, illicit drug use, absenteeism from school, or having problems with teachers, are 
also more likely to seek help after experiencing online sexual solicitation.232 This suggests that children 
can also develop protective strategies and resilience. Parenting plays a key role in protecting children. 
A recent cross-sectional study conducted across six countries shows that instructive parental mediation 
is negatively related to being a victim of online sexual solicitation among children aged 12–17 years, 
while restrictive mediation predicts higher levels of victimization.233 
8.2.2. Sextortion
Sexual extortion, sometimes referred to as ‘sextortion’ is the threatened dissemination of images of a 
sexual nature without consent, usually to exact revenge or procure benefits such as additional images, 
sexual acts or money.234 
Our database search for the period yielded only one study on sextortion among a nationally 
representative sample of children, conducted by Patchin and Hinduja (2018).235 The study of children 
aged 12–17 years in the United States used single-item, dichotomous questions for measuring 
victimization and offending. The findings from this study may only be relevant for children in the United 
States and should not be generalized to other countries.
Key findings
  Sextortion usually occurs within existing relationships (romantic or friendship) and much less by 
among people unknown to each other. Children involved in offending are also more likely to be 
victims of sextortion.
  The data on sextortion are mostly inconclusive, with large variation between studies. According 
to the studies in our sample, boys are more likely to be involved in sextortion than girls, both as 
victims and perpetrators, but are less likely to tell anyone about it.236 Victims are more likely to be 
non-heterosexual. There are no differences based on age and race. 
The study indicates that 5 per cent of children aged 12–17 years had reported ever being victims of 
sextortion. Three per cent had reported being offenders. There is a connection between offending and 
victimization. Those involved in one role are more likely to also be involved in the other, similar to 
online bullying. Unlike other forms of sexual exploitation, where girls tend to be the victims, sextortion 
victims are more likely to be boys and to be non-heterosexual. Boys are also more likely than girls to 
target others. The study found no difference in sextortion experiences by race and no consistent

sextortion . Such differences may be due to reporting, measurement or local differences. 56
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 difference concerning age, except that 15-year-olds are generally more likely to be involved compared 
with children of other ages.
The victims of sextortion experience a range of harms, such as being stalked or harassed (10 per cent 
of boys and 24 per cent of girls), being contacted repeatedly online or over the phone (43 per cent of 
boys and 41 per cent of girls) or having a fake profile created in their name (11 per cent of boys and 9 
per cent of girls). In about one in four cases, the sextortion results in the sharing of the image with 
someone else without permission.
According to the study by Patchin and Hinduja (2018), boys are significantly less likely to tell someone, 
including a parent, the police or their school, about a sextortion incident. Only 35 per cent report it, 
compared with 47 per cent of girls. When boys do tell someone, they most often turn to a friend (45 per 
cent), compared with 39 per cent of girls. Girls most often turn to their parent (42 per cent), compared 
with 29 per cent of boys. Very few sextortion victims report the incident to the site or app on which it 
occurred (5 per cent of boys and 7 per cent of girls). 
8.2.3. Intimate partner violence online
Intimate partner violence online is broadly defined as abusive behaviour, such as harassment, control 
or stalking, within a sexual relationship or by a dating partner, facilitated by technology.237 
Five studies and one meta-review in our sample address cyber-dating violence. The research is based in 
Europe (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, England [in the United Kingdom], Italy, Norway and Spain) and the 
United States. It employs school-based surveys, mostly with convenience sampling methods. One 
study employs a purposive sample stratified by community risk factors, such as poverty, 
unemployment, minority populations, rental housing, female-headed households and community 
violence, with a random selection of schools and participants.238 
Key findings
  Girls are more likely to be victims of intimate partner violence, as are children transitioning to 
adolescence, those in a heterosexual relationship, those who have a wider age gap with their 
partner and those who have experienced bullying victimization or perpetration.
  Adverse childhood experiences, such as exposure to violence, abuse and other trauma, and risk-
taking, such as alcohol binge drinking for boys and early and unsafe sex for girls, are risk-predicting 
factors.
  Girls are more negatively affected by the experience of intimate partner violence than boys and are 
more likely to be monitored or pressured by their partner. 
  Parental involvement, such as monitoring and emotional bonding, can be a protective factor 
in relation to intimate partner violence online. But there is no association with family and peer 
support, community engagement among children or school connectedness. 
237 (Smith-Darden et al., 2017; Van Ouytsel et al., 2016; Backe et al., 2018)
238 (Smith-Darden et al., 2017)57
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 The evidence suggests that girls are more likely to be the victims of intimate partner violence, as are 
those who are younger than their partner, those in a heterosexual relationship and those who have 
experience of bullying victimization or perpetration.239 Girls are more likely to be sent too many 
messages that make them feel uncomfortable, to be pressured to share passwords or respond quickly 
to calls or texts, or to have their messages, whereabouts and activities monitored by their partner.240 A 
wider age gap between the partners and being the victim of such electronic intrusion are associated 
with a higher likelihood of perpetration. Girls are also more negatively affected by the experience than 
boys.241 
Gender plays an important role in relation to predictive risk factors. A study with children and young 
people in Belgium aged 16–22 years who had been victims of cyber-dating abuse found that male 
victims were significantly more likely to have engaged in alcohol binge drinking, while girls were more 
likely to have been sexually active at a younger age and to have had unprotected sex.242 Another study, 
which tested the relationship between family, school- and community-level factors and various forms 
of cyber-dating aggression among children in the United States, found that gender (male) predicts 
coercive sexting but not cyber-stalking or online harassment.243 
Perpetration of intimate partner and cyber-dating violence is, overall, more common among children 
transitioning to adolescence and those from black and other minority ethnic backgrounds, according to 
a United States-based study. As with online sexual solicitation, offline vulnerability and parenting are 
significant factors predicting victimization and protection. Adverse childhood experiences, such as 
exposure to violence, abuse and other trauma, significantly predict higher rates of cyber-dating 
aggression perpetration.244 Parental involvement in the form of parental monitoring and emotional 
bonding is significantly associated with a lower likelihood of perpetration of all forms of cyber-dating 
aggression. Perceived safety of the community predicts lower levels of cyber-stalking only.245  There is 
no association between intimate partner or cyber-dating violence and family and peer support, 
community engagement among children or school connectedness.246 
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  As with most of the other aspects of children’s internet use, more evidence is needed on the long-
term outcomes for children of experiencing online sexual exploitation and abuse. For example, 
more evidence is required on recovery time and on children’s capacity to form healthy attachments 
to trustworthy others in both the immediate aftermath and later in life.
  We need to understand the offline context of children’s lives to identify risk and protective factors 
for online sexual exploitation and abuse and how to support children’s ability to cope. What role do 
cultural taboos and poverty or inequality play in facilitating sexual exploitation and abuse online or 
offline?

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   If we are to understand online sexual exploitation and abuse, we need more evidence to explain 
the pathways between children’s online and offline vulnerability, their exposure to online sexual 
solicitation and their response to it. This would entail developing a model mapping the digital 
ecology, perpetrators’ behaviours, children’s digital skills and online activities, and children’s 
background and living environment (home, school, community) with the occurrence of sexual 
solicitations and sexual abuse. There are inconsistencies and variations in how researchers define, 
measure and explain online sexual exploitation and abuse. This creates challenges for identifying 
a clear model of vulnerability and protection. In most studies, the relationship between children 
and the perpetrators is unclear. Further gaps relate to the online platforms where such interactions 
happen and how they unfold. 
  There is more focus in the literature on associations between online sexual exploitation of children 
and other risk factors and much less on the experiences of harm and the long-term impact on 
children’s well-being and outcomes. 
  There needs to be an exploration of the nature of online platforms, applications, services and 
networks to understand how these may facilitate or protect against child sexual exploitation.59

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 9. MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING
The studies we reviewed typically offer a narrow measure of children’s psychological well-being. A 
more comprehensive model is needed. A promising solution can be offered by the work of Ryff, an 
American academic and psychologist, which is among the most popular conceptualizations of 
psychological well-being.247 Her model of well-being incorporates measures of six dimensions: self-
acceptance, positive relations with others, personal growth, purpose in life, environmental mastery, 
and autonomy. This model has been successfully applied by The Children’s Society in its international 
survey of children’s well-being (Children’s Worlds), which in wave 3 involves child participants aged 
8–12 years from 40 countries around the world.248 This research makes connections between well-being 
and children’s lives and daily activities, their time use and their own perceptions and evaluations of 
their well-being. Ryff’s model can be supplemented by measures of depression, self-harm and life 
satisfaction. It is worth noting that well-being may be positioned as an outcome or as an input, for 
example, as a measure of child vulnerability. 
We identified 34 studies on digital technology and its relation to mental health and well-being, most of 
which are based in Europe (Belgium, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Northern 
Ireland [United Kingdom], Norway, Spain, Sweden, and Wales [United Kingdom]) and North America 
(Canada and the United States). A smaller number of studies address the context in parts of Asia and 
the Middle East (China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan Province of 
China and Thailand). The research is predominantly survey-based, with only one qualitative study249 and 
one meta-analysis.250 The majority of quantitative studies are cross-sectional and face methodological 
issues such as small or convenience samples. There are several longitudinal studies251 in the review but 
some of them are limited in their findings by sampling issues. 
Key findings 
  Long-term outcomes related to children’s well-being, mental health or resilience are rarely 
explored. The evidence on how factors related to digital device and internet use may intersect with 
offline factors and predict child well-being requires development. 
  The evidence on the impact of children’s internet use on mental health and well-being is mixed 
and inconclusive. Some studies show a positive association between internet use and negative 
outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts and panic disorder, while others show a 
negative association, and some studies show no relationship at all.
  In most cases, there is only evidence about an association, not causality. A child who uses the 
internet excessively and experiences poor mental health may be using digital technologies as a 
way of coping with pre-existing issues.
  The internet can have a positive effect on mental health and well-being. Children who receive 
mental health support online or who can talk about their problems with friends online have 
reduced depression levels.

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   What matters for children’s mental health is less the time spent using the internet and social media 
and more how children use their time online and the consequences of that use. 
A recent UNICEF review on the impact of digital technology use on children’s mental health and well-
being found that the evidence to date is largely inconclusive. It concludes that children’s use of digital 
technology is more often assessed in terms of the time spent online rather than by measuring such 
factors as the type of online activities children engage in, or the context of internet use.252 This evidence 
review found similarly mixed results. While some studies show a positive association between internet 
use and mental health problems, others find a negative association253 or no association at all. For 
example, findings from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies conducted in China, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, the Republic of Korea and the United States show a significant association between 
increased digital, social media or internet use and higher levels of anxiety, depressive symptoms, 
suicidal ideation, panic disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).254 This association 
is stronger among children who do not live with either of their parents.255 
In contrast, three longitudinal studies from Canada, European countries and the United States found no 
a significant direct impact of the time children spend using digital technologies, such as social media, 
the internet and texting, on their mental health in terms of depression and anxiety.256 Another study 
found that moderate social media use was associated with the highest levels of mental well-being, 
compared with either too much or too little social media use.257 
It is plausible that these conflicting results stem from the different ways in which digital media use is 
measured. Comparing longitudinal studies, it seems that those that find no relationship with mental 
health measure use in terms of hours spent online per day or per week. Studies that do find an 
association measure the number of times per day or per week that children use certain digital platforms 
or do specific activities such as sending messages or using social media. 
Several studies show that what matters for children’s mental health is not merely the time spent using 
the internet and social media, but rather how children use this time, what they experience online and 
the consequences of that use. More specifically, it is the negative perceived impact of high levels of 
internet use or social media stress on sleep loss and withdrawal (negative mood when the internet is 
inaccessible) that indirectly mediates the adverse effect on mental health over time.258 Another study 
found that children who report frequent, daily use across all social media platforms suffer worse 
mental health problems compared with low social media use subgroups.259 
The possible causal relationship between intense internet use and decreased mental health and well-
being is rarely studied. Hence, it is often difficult to say whether excessive use of digital technologies is

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 the cause or consequence of poor mental health. In fact, one study found evidence of reverse 
causation, where greater depressive symptoms predicted more frequent social media use, although 
only among girls.260 Most studies do not show significant gender differences in these associations. 
A study in the United States of 5,593 students aged 12–17 years examined digital self-harm, defined as 
the “anonymous online posting, sending, or otherwise sharing of hurtful content about oneself” .  The 
authors found that it was significantly correlated with experiences of depressive symptoms.261 A 
qualitative study with children with a previous history of self-harm revealed that the internet can act as 
a catalyst for children’s self-harm behaviours, normalizing them through their participation in online 
communities where others share self-harm practices and techniques, and through easy access to 
images that invoke a physical reaction and inspire behavioural enactment.262 
Digital self-harm is also associated with other experiences of violence and risk, both offline and online, 
such as school bullying and cyber-bullying, drug use, and participation in various forms of adolescent 
deviance, such as attacking someone or stealing. These results tie in with the evidence of the positive 
association between cyber-bullying victimization and online sexual solicitation among children and 
suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety.263 
Another group of studies demonstrates the positive impact of internet use on mental health and 
well-being. Higher levels of children’s well-being are positively associated with receiving mental health 
support online and with speaking to friends online regarding personal problems.264 Similarly, decreased 
levels of depression are associated with freely revealing negative emotions online.265 Social media use 
can be a positive coping mechanism for socially rejected children because they tend to use it to share 
their personal difficulties.266 A positive effect on mental health is also observed when internet use is 
perceived to make life more meaningful, improve school grades or enhance performance.267 Thus, 
besides time spent online, it is important to understand the ways in which children use the internet and 
social media, what they are exposed to while online and the mediating perceived consequences of that 
use, to have a better idea of the impact on their mental health. 
An overwhelming majority of the studies we reviewed do not measure outcomes at all. Instead, they 
describe the incidence of certain behaviours but leave their consequences unexplored.268 Among the 
studies that do examine outcomes, most outcomes measured in online risk research are immediate 
and topic-relevant. Long-term outcomes, such as well-being, mental health or resilience, are rarely 
explored. For instance, in studies of cyber-bystanding, one outcome measured is that of expressed 
empathy with the victim following an intervention. But the long-term consequences of being a cyber-

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 bystander are not examined.269 In studies of online sexual solicitation, a short-term outcome measured 
may be help-seeking from friends or family, while longer-term outcomes that may be related to well-
being and mental health are not explored.270 
Efforts to tackle long-term consequences present a methodological challenge for cross-sectional 
studies. Measures of well-being may be positioned as an outcome or as an input, such as a measure of 
child vulnerability. Studies that acknowledge this problem tend to posit a bidirectional or transactional 
process, whereby more vulnerable young people may become drawn into online risk and, in turn, find 
themselves more likely to experience harm, or they simply observe correlations. For instance, one 
study271 found a correlation between sexting and negative mental health and well-being, such as 
suicidal thoughts and behaviours, and body image concerns. 
Strikingly, we found few studies exploring the consequences of online sexual solicitation on victims’ 
well-being. The literature clearly assumes that these are adverse, but the evidence (and the measures 
needed) are underdeveloped; the Disrupting Harm project will address this gap. In the research on 
sexting, there is little examination of outcomes, which is also problematic, though here the outcomes 
are less certain since sexting can be either a voluntary or a coerced behaviour.
Limitations and suggestions for further research
  One substantial gap in the literature relates to the lack of a comprehensive approach to studying the 
relationship between internet use and well-being and how offline factors may influence outcomes. 
Cross-national research on children’s well-being in relation to the offline domain demonstrates 
the importance of a wide range of child-related factors. These include age, gender, home context, 
family relationships, peer relationships, school context, teacher relationships, neighbourhood 
quality,272 health and safety, and risk behaviours, such as obesity, substance abuse, violence, and 
sexual risk-taking.273 Country-level factors, such as gross domestic product and income inequality, 
are not strong predictors of child well-being.274 We found no studies examining how factors related 
to digital device and internet use may intersect with offline factors and predict child well-being. This 
highlights the need for further research. 
  With few exceptions, most studies focus on the impact on mental health of time spent using the 
internet, without considering the nature or context of the different activities that children engage in 
online. When testing the impact of time spent online, researchers rarely include variables related to 
the perceived quality of online experiences or issues to do with online victimization, such as cyber-
bullying.

Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 10.  THE FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA
  Robust, high-quality and comparable research is still necessary. In many areas, our knowledge 
remains tentative. The large majority of studies we found are based on small or non-representative 
samples, involve correlational analyses of cross-sectional data and control for a limited number of 
background variables. While such studies offer some insights, their limitations make it difficult to 
establish whether the effects observed are due to digital technology use or other factors from the 
child’s wider life environment.
  We need a better representation of the diversity of children’s circumstances. At present, most 
research examines the experiences of older children and those from the global North. Evidence on 
the pre-teenage years and from global South countries is sparse. Filling these gaps will enhance 
our understanding of the pathways to harm and vulnerability, and the protective factors that help 
to build resilience. 
  We still need to learn more about the positive effects of children’s internet use. Only one fifth 
(79 out of 359) of the studies we reviewed explore opportunities and benefits of internet use. In 
contrast, children’s encounters with certain online risks – particularly excessive internet use, cyber-
bullying, gambling and problematic gaming – feature heavily in the research literature. 
  Many studies examine the effects of the time children spend using the internet, without including 
variables related to the perceived quality or context of online experiences or experiences related 
to online victimization, for example, cyber-bullying. This is a serious limitation, which constrains 
our understanding of which activities are more relevant to positive child outcomes. Even more 
so as recent research demonstrates that subjective measures of time spent online can be highly 
unreliable. 
  There are significant cross-country differences in children’s exposure to opportunities and risks. We 
need to draw on conceptually and theoretically sound models of children’s internet use to develop 
a better understanding of what factors are significantly associated with positive and negative 
experiences, and how much these matter for different groups of children. To do so, we also need 
more consistent definitions and measures of those factors to enable comparative research.
  More evidence is needed on the outcomes of children’s internet use. While studies may link 
children’s online experiences to predictive factors in their life circumstances, they rarely follow up 
on the consequences of children’s internet use over time, to document either benefits or harms. The 
evidence is particularly scarce in relation to long-term outcomes such as well-being, mental health 
and resilience, which require longitudinal research. To develop the longitudinal evidence base in 
this field, we need more long-term investment funding for and research commitment to the study 
of children’s outcomes, implementing efficient ways to account for the rapid changes in the digital 
environment. 
  We still lack an understanding of how the different research themes covered in this report are 
linked, for example, children’s online risks and opportunities and the factors that influence both. 
Although Global Kids Online and other projects have proposed models to explore these relations, 
and generated hypotheses about how these shape children’s well-being in an increasingly digital 
world, few recently published studies have tested these models.275
275 We have begun this process in our recent 11-country comparative report comparing Global Kids Online findings for cross-national 
similarities and differences, see: http://globalkidsonline.net/synthesis-report-2019/64
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03   We need a better understanding of children’s digital ecology. There needs to be some exploration 
of the nature of digital devices, online platforms, applications, services and networks to understand 
how these may facilitate or protect against online risk and harm. 
  More evidence is needed to explain the pathways between children’s online and offline 
vulnerability, exposure to both offline and online risks, and children’s responses to risk. 
Investigating these pathways would entail developing a model of mechanisms mapping the digital 
ecology, perpetrators’ behaviours, children’s digital skills and online activities, and children’s 
backgrounds and living environment (home, school, community) with the occurrence of different 
types of risk and harm online. This should be done using a combination of analyses of personal, 
country-level and digital ecology factors that can foster or prevent children’s exposure to risk. 
  There is an urgent need for child-centred research methods to complement the recent evidence.276 
We still do not understand anywhere near enough about how children see these issues. We need 
research on cultures of childhood, as they are experienced by children themselves. For example, 
we need research on forms of sexual exploration online that may be tolerated or even encouraged 
because they have positive impacts on children’s evolving identities. There is a need for researchers 
to conduct more studies that allow children to talk about online experiences in their own words.277

Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 APPENDIX: METHODOLOGY AND SEARCH PROTOCOL 
1. Databases and search terms
Web of Science and Scopus  were chosen as the two databases that yielded the largest number of 
high-quality results and allowed additional filtering for relevance (e.g., by discipline), based on 
our previous evidence review work.278 
 Web of Science  Core Collection  – provides access to articles covering all aspects of science, the 
social sciences and the humanities from more than 20,000 journals, plus around 1.4 billion 
references. The journal selection process is publisher-neutral and applied consistently to all 
journals from 3,300 publishing partners. Existing titles are reviewed to maintain quality levels.
 Scopus  – indexes content from 24,600 active titles and 5,000 publishers . This is rigorously vetted 
and selected by an independent review board. It includes peer-reviewed literature from 
scientific journals, books and conference proceedings in the fields of science, technology, 
medicine, the social sciences, and the arts and humanities.
  We supplemented these databases with additional resources (n=5) suggested via a consultation 
with experts. 
Search terms 
Each search included a combination of title, abstract and keywords, blending several groups of 
keywords: 
Search 1
  Group 1, child  terms: child* OR youth OR teen* OR adolescen* OR minor OR kid OR girl OR boy OR 
pupil279 (in title)
  Group 2, technology  terms: digital* OR mobile* OR internet OR online OR social media (in title)

  Scopus subject areas (by number of studies): medicine (321), social sciences (209), psychology 
(195), computer science (83), arts and humanities (53), nursing (27), multidisciplinary (2)
278 (Livingstone and Stoilova, 2019; Livingstone et al., 2017; Stoilova et al., 2019) 
279 Initially we included “student” but this resulted in a very high number of irrelevant studies on adult students. 66

  Scopus disciplines : medicine, social sciences, psychology, nursing, computer science, arts and 
humanities, multidisciplinary 
The above search protocol was determined following the testing of different options. For example, it 
would have been preferable to search the title, abstract and keywords for group 1 and 2 words in 
search 1 but this produced 15,550 search results in Web of Science only, which was unmanageable in a 
rapid evidence review. This search also produced a high number of irrelevant results. Hence, search 1 
was reduced to group 1 and 2 words in the title only, which worked better. 
2. Results and screening 
Search 1 produced a total of 1,001 results (n=397 in Web of Science and n=604 in Scopus). Search 
2 produced 1,084 results (n=810 in Web of Science and n=274 in Scopus). These were pooled, 
yielding 2,085 combined search results. Five more studies were added based on expert 
suggestions. After removing the duplicates, there were 1,587 unique search results, which were 
screened.
280 The online violence terms were generated from relevant reports. For example, UNICEF (2017), ECPAT International (2016), Quayle 
(2016).67
Investigating Risks and Opportunities for Children in a Digital World
Innocenti Discussion Paper 2020-03 Screening
  Phase 1 : The results (n=1,582) were screened based on title and abstract, and the results not 
meeting the inclusion criteria were removed (n=1,136). 
  Phase 2 : The full text as screened for the remaining texts (n=446), applying the same criteria for 
relevance and a new requirement for methodological rigour, and removing all studies that do not 
meet the criteria (n=63). Results for which the full text was unavailable were also removed (n=24), 
creating a final sample for analysis (n=359).
In relation to the particular focus on harm, most of the studies were based on research with adults 
(either victims or perpetrators) or case files, rather than research with children. Several studies also 
analysed online interactions between children and perpetrators. These were also excluded. 
Exclusions
The exclusions made during the screening mostly related to: 
  App/software/online content development: studies discussing the development or effectiveness 
of online content/apps (depression prevention, obesity, illness recovery, substance use, smoking, 
drinking) or marketing research (e.g., customer satisfaction). 
  Technology-related words producing irrelevant results: mostly these were online research methods 
(online interviews, surveys, focus groups, forums, online panel studies) used to study non-internet-
related issues and occasionally cases where ‘mobile’ is not related to technology (e.g., ‘mobile 
pastoralists’). 
  Child-related words producing irrelevant results: the exclusions here relate to some results 
focusing on young adults or university students, as well as practitioners working with children 
(youth workers, medical practitioners, teachers); adult children; or adult perpetrators of online 
violence against children.68

The Challenges of Parental Responsibility  
in Comparative Perspective
Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina Byrne
Abstract
As children in high, middle and even low-income countries gain access to the internet 
via a range of digital devices and services – most often via a mobile phone – parents are 
feeling challenged in their competence, role and authority. In response, parents draw on 
their available resources – socioeconomic and cultural – and their preferred parenting 
styles as well as some of the principles of positive parenting. In high income countries, a 
shift is underway from restrictive towards enabling forms of parental mediation. In middle 
and low-income countries, the evidence suggests that restrictive mediation is generally 
favoured by parents, although this brings costs in terms of children’s opportunities online, 
especially for girls. In all countries, the rapid pace of technological innovation undermines 
parental competence, this is in turn undermining children’s willingness to turn to parents 
for support. We conclude with suggestions to support parents in meeting the growing 
challenge of empowering their children online in diverse contexts.

Introduction
Who is responsible for enabling children’s internet use and protecting them from risks? 
Generally, the first answer is parents, especially when it comes to keeping children safe. 
Parents are held responsible for teaching their children about values, social norms 
and accepted behaviour. They are also expected to enable their children to study, help 
in the family, keep healthy, cross the road, and make good judgements about people, 
places and information. In enacting these responsibilities, parents – we include here

Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina Byrnestep parents, grandparents and any other adults and older siblings taking on a caring 
role – have always been able to draw on their own life experience and the traditions 
and knowledge of their community. 
But as children in high, middle and even low-income countries gain access to the 
internet, parents are feeling challenged – especially as their children use mobile devices 
that are difficult for parents to supervise, and technologically complex services that 
parents may not understand. They are also influenced by popular worries about screen 
time, internet addiction, stranger danger and so on. So whatever is normatively  expected 
of parents, there are practical  limits to what they can do. No wonder that, in whichever 
country has recently gained widespread internet access, there is a groundswell of con -
cern – from parents  as they struggle to enact their responsibilities and about parents  as 
governments worry about the digital divide, child protection and cybercrime, on the 
one hand and, on the other, the digital skills of the future labour force.
Also under pressure are schools, expected to teach the digital literacies needed for 
children to benefit from the expanding digital opportunities; welfare and mental health 
services, now expected to address problems children face in proprietary online services; 
law enforcement, dealing with networked crimes involving child victims at considerable 
scale; and businesses, striving to expand into digital markets but undermined by issues 
of consumer literacy and trust. From the perspective of these organisations, the more 
that parents can take on to prepare their children for the digital age, the less the bur -
den on them. Conversely, the less able parents are to enable and protect their children, 
the greater are the calls for appropriate education, regulation, public expenditure and 
corporate social responsibility.
Parenting offline and online – how do they relate?
What kinds of parenting styles are likely to be effective in relation to the digital environ -
ment? There is a growing body of evidence, especially from high and middle-income 
countries, that demonstrates the importance of positive parenting for child development, 
including early childhood physical, cognitive and emotional development, educational 
outcomes, improved communication and trust, reduction in risk taking behaviour 
among adolescents, improved social competence of adolescents and reduction of 
violence (Daly, 2007; Knerr, Gardner & Cluver, 2013; Moore, Whitney & Kinukawa, 
2009). What is often considered “positive parenting” includes “stimulation and affection, 
clear and focused praise, supporting increasing autonomy, encouraging healthy habits, 
goal setting, establishing firm rules and consequences” (De Stone, 2016: 10). However, 
when children enter adolescents from around the age of 10, there are also changes in 
parent-child relationships with adolescents seeking more autonomy and independence 
(Patton et al., 2016), and parenting styles must adapt.
In 2007 the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a framework that ex -
amines key dimensions of parenting or parental roles that positively affect adolescent 21
Parenting in the Digital Agewell-being: connection, behaviour control, respect for individuality, modelling ap -
propriate behaviour, and provision and protection (WHO, 2007). These parental roles 
can be easily applied to all situations and environments, including to children’s digital 
world, as follows:
 1. Connection – a positive, stable, emotional bond between parents and adolescents is 
an important factor contributing to child and adolescent health and development. 
In the digital world that means that a child or an adolescent who feels connected 
with their parents is more likely to share their offline and online experiences 
without fearing their access will be blocked. Our Global Kids Online study shows 
that where children say they have positive relationship with parents in general 
(manifested through support and praise) they are more likely to share with them 
when negative things happen online (Georgiev et al., 2017; Logar et al., 2016).
 2. Behaviour control – this includes “supervising and monitoring adolescents’ ac -
tivities, establishing behavioural rules and consequences for misbehaviour, and 
conveying clear expectations for behaviour” (WHO, 2007: 11). When it comes to 
children and the digital technologies, this could include rules about time spent 
on the internet, use of digital devices after bed time, in children’s bedrooms, 
during meal time, as well as understanding what children do online, how they 
set up their privacy controls, with whom they share personal information etc. 
South African parents surveyed through Global Kids Online on average exhibit 
the digital skills of 12 to 14-year olds, making it relatively difficult for them to 
support and supervise their children’s online behaviour (Phyfer et al., 2016). The 
Bulgarian Kids Online survey shows that parental engagement in children’s online 
activities declines with children’s age, with 44 per cent of parents engaging with 
9 to 11-year olds and only 30 per cent with 12-year olds and older (Kanchev et 
al., 2017).
 3. Respect for individuality – this means allowing the adolescent to develop a healthy 
sense of self, apart from his or her parents. This includes listening to what ado -
lescents have to say, trusting them to complete their responsibilities or to take 
on new roles in the family. In the digital domain this means allowing children 
and adolescents to explore the internet independently in much the same way we 
would allow them to explore the physical world. The age and capacities of the 
child matter, as younger children will clearly need more guidance than the older 
ones. The Global Kids Online research shows that the 9 to 11-year old group finds 
it particularly difficult to know what information online is true and what is not 
(Byrne et al., 2016).
 4. Modelling appropriate behaviour – children and adolescents identify with their 
parents, absorb the values and norms established in the home and try to emulate 
parental behaviour. If parents spend most of their free time online, there is a strong 
likelihood that the children will do too. If parents share too much information 22
Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina Byrneonline, will that affect how children share their own personal information or 
information about their friends? Through development of their sense of agency 
children may depart from the established norm in the family and decide to take 
a different approach to that of their parents. We have seen examples of children 
disagreeing over “sharenting” or parental sharing of content and images of their 
children online (Blum-Ross & Livingstone, 2017).
 5. Provision and protection – parents cannot meet all the needs of the growing 
adolescent. Their role is also to seek the resources for their children that they 
cannot provide or to ensure that they have access to appropriate services. When 
it comes to protection of children online parents still have an important role to 
play. But so do peers, teachers and other adults in children’s lives. When asked 
who they turn to if they experience something hurtful online, children would 
turn to “peers” first and then “parents” second, as we show below (Byrne et al., 
2016). 
To what extent these parenting roles will be fulfilled, what parenting style will be adopted 
and what parenting practices will prevail will depend on many factors including parental 
education, beliefs and culture as well as the individual and institutional support avail -
able to parents. As we discuss in what follows, this varies in different parts of the world.
In high income countries
In the early days of internet access in Europe and North America, many children be -
came confident and competent internet users before their parents and teachers. This 
resulted in a considerable generation gap – parents underestimated their children’s use 
and the risk of harm they encountered online. As a consequence, few parents supported 
their children’s internet use beyond the fact of providing access. By the same token, 
few children turned to their parents for support when they encountered a problem 
on the internet. A culture rapidly developed in which, to generalize, many parents felt 
disempowered – ignorant of their children’s experiences online, susceptible to media 
panics about internet predators or pornography, and therefore restrictive in managing 
their children’s internet access. 
But the situation is now changing. A recent survey of 6,400 European parents of 
children aged 6 to14 (in France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, Italy, Sweden 
and the UK) found parents to be fairly concerned about their children’s online experi -
ences – especially exposure to violent images and being bullied online, but also about 
their children being exposed to data tracking, digital identity theft and advertisements 
for unhealthy lifestyles (Livingstone et al., 2017a). However, analysis of what parents 
said they actually did to manage their children’s internet use revealed two styles of 
parental mediation:23
Parenting in the Digital Age 1. Restrictive mediation:  Parents restricting or banning or insisting on supervising 
any of a long list of online activities
 2. Enabling mediation:  Parents undertaking active strategies such as talking to a 
child about what they do online or encouraging their activities as well as giving 
safety advice; also activities that might seem restrictive (use of technical controls 
and parental monitoring) but are better interpreted as building a safe framework 
precisely so that positive uses of the internet can be encouraged.
In terms of outcomes, more enabling mediation by parents was positively associated 
with children’s experience of online opportunities, but also with more online risks. 
Conversely, more restrictive mediation was associated with fewer online risks experi -
enced by children, but also they enjoyed fewer opportunities. This makes it problematic 
if policy-makers concerned with risk urge parents to restrict children’s internet use 
without recognising the costs to their online opportunities. But also problematic is the 
tendency of educators to urge parents to enable children’s internet use without recog -
nising that this may bring more risk. In addition, both parents and policy makers need 
to be aware that risks do not necessarily translate to harm and that enabling mediation 
helps children to build resilience and adopt strategies that can help them stay safe both 
offline and online. 
Further analysis of the European parent survey showed that parents prefer a risk-
averse restrictive strategy for their less skilled children, presumably doubting their child’s 
ability to cope with risk if they encounter it, while being more encouraging of if their 
children, or they themselves, are more competent internet users. Thus in the Global 
North, it is time to recognize that many parents are also gaining digital skills and they 
can use these to enable their child online. However, parents who are less confident of 
their own or their child’s digital skills take a more restrictive approach, keeping their 
child safe, but at the cost of online opportunities – so, to avoid a vicious cycle of disad -
vantage, parents as well as children could be provided with digital literacy education.
To sum up, what we learned in the Global North suggests the value of an open dia -
logue between parent and child so that each comes to understand and respond to the 
online experiences, competences, and concerns of the other. However, insofar as parents 
or children lack digital skills, inequalities in children’s online opportunities may open 
up. EU Kids Online research shows other ways in which disadvantages in home life 
offline may extend online: children more vulnerable to risk of harm offline also tend 
to be more vulnerable online; also, around one in eight parents does not provide sup -
portive or safety mediation; last, around half of parents whose child has encountered 
an online risk is unaware of this – and this in countries where two-thirds of children 
say their parents know a fair amount about what they do online.
So even in the Global North, many parents and carers lack time, knowledge or other 
resources to manage their children’s internet use as well as they would wish, either to 
promote opportunities or minimize risks. And their responses both reflect and repro -
duce socio-economic inequalities in children’s life changes, now online as well as offline. 24
Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina ByrneMoreover, the continual flow of technological innovations further destabilizes parental 
competence and confidence while placing children at the cutting edge of experimental 
forms of technological innovation (Lupton & Williamson, 2017). Add to this the con -
tradictory exhortations on the one hand to minimize “screen time” and, on the other, 
to buy the latest device to ensure children “keep up” , and parental anxieties become 
intense (Blum-Ross & Livingstone, this book).
In low and middle-income countries
It seems likely that the above problems are exacerbated in low and middle-income 
countries for several reasons (UNICEF, 2017). First, even though close to 4 billion peo -
ple – mostly in the Global South – are not connected, of those who are, young people 
below the age of 25 are nearly three times more likely than the general population to 
be using the internet (ITU, 2013). So while children are often “pioneers” in exploring 
the internet, they may lack support from knowledgeable adults. As Gouws (2014: 14) 
comments about South African teenagers’ use of technology, although “perceived to 
be street-smart, arrogant “know-it-alls” and technological experts, they are also young, 
lonely, insecure and find themselves in a life period of major developmental challenges” .
Many children in developing countries are brought up by a single parent or even by 
relatives, often grandparents. In Central/South America and sub-Saharan Africa, children 
are more likely to live with either one or neither of their parents than children in other 
regions (Child Trends, 2017). Factors such as migration, illness, parental death, poverty 
affect these family units’ functioning and parents or caregivers are often left with little 
resources and time to help with their children with the digital skills. The digital divide 
between children and their grandparents is even more pronounced and it is hard to 
expect that a 70-year old will be able to monitor his or her grandchild’s internet use or 
support them with the development of digital skills. 
Sometimes, parental mediation techniques are based on the cultural norms prevail -
ing in society, tending to restrict children’s digital use even further (Bulger et al., 2017), 
which may in turn lead to children hiding from their parents what they do online. For 
instance, Davidson and Martellozzo (2013: 1456) found in their study in Bahrain, that: 
“Young people use digital media in much the same way regardless of the social and 
cultural contexts, but that culturally gendered perspectives place restrictions upon us -
age. ” Specifically, they note that parental expectations about girls’ use of digital media 
led girls to conceal acts that would be judged unacceptable (such as communicating 
with boys online) or that would be harshly punished if discovered. 
Indeed, parenting restrictions can fall particularly heavily on girls (Livingstone et 
al., 2017b). As Porter and colleagues (2012: 159) note in their study of three African 
countries: “ These constraints [on girls by parents and communities], often imposed 
at least in part from positive welfare motives, can be a substantial barrier to accessing 
education and improved livelihoods, especially (but not only) in rural areas. ” A study 25
Parenting in the Digital Ageof parental mediation practices in South Africa found that girls received less parental 
mediation with regard to their internet use, which was associated with fewer online 
risks but also with lower levels of digital skills and fewer online opportunities (Phyfer 
& Kardefelt-Winther, forthcoming).
The degree to which parents and carers are often reluctant to discuss sexual matters 
with teenagers can leave them vulnerable to online and offline risks as they search for 
answers online, potentially finding problematic content as a result (Nwalo & Anasi, 
2012).  No wonder that girls themselves call for efforts to educate parents, teachers and 
communities on the importance of their access to the internet, and to having ICTs better 
integrated in the curriculum (de Pauw, 2011). Parents may also not understand the nature 
of the risks online. In Turkey, a small-scale survey of 12 to19-year-olds found that “the 
most reported form of exposure to cyberbullying students experience is being insulted 
and being threatened” (Aricak et al., 2008: 259) yet that parents and teachers tend to 
see verbal threats as less serious than physical bullying face-to-face, notwithstanding 
research which shows harms from cyberbullying (United Nations, 2016). 
In South Africa, parents do worry about children experiencing of bullying online yet 
a sizeable percentage of children (40%) said they experienced bullying in person which 
parents did not mention as a concern. Such one-sided worries stem from the lack of 
parental knowledge of both digital technologies and their children’s life experiences, 
so their mediation practices may go “from total restriction and no access to a device, 
to access to a device with little guidance on how to use the internet safely” (Phyfer et 
al., 2016: 15). 
In addition, since in the least developed countries school attendance is low, pupil/
teacher ratios are high, and the overcrowded classrooms and untrained teachers are 
common (UNESCO, 2016). It seems fair to conclude that in many countries, children 
lack a supportive and/or informed adult in their lives who can teach them to navigate 
the internet safely or offer support when needed. 
What is being done, what can be done?
Policy and practice must respect the different conditions that apply in different parts of 
the world. The Global Kids Online (GKO) project is interviewing and surveying parents 
and children (aged 9-17) across different continents to benchmark and track children’s 
online access, skills, opportunities, risk and safety – and the skills and protective actions 
of their parents. Recent findings from partners’ research reveals the different sources of 
support that children themselves turn to in different contexts (Byrne et al., 2016; Cabello 
et al., 2017; Georgiev et al., 2017; Kanchev et al., 2017; Logar et al., 2016; Phyfer et al., 
2016; Popadić et al., 2016).
Figure 1 shows that in Bulgaria and Montenegro parents are more likely to be 
children’s first recourse for help when something is problematic on the internet, com -
pared with in the Global South countries surveyed. In Chile, children seem less likely 26
Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina Byrneto tell anyone at all, while in South Africa and the Philippines, friends are preferred 
over parents, though both are helpful. In no country do children turn to teachers or 
other professionals in significant numbers. This suggests that it is difficult to provide 
alternative adult sources of support to parents, but that children might be supported 
by peer-based mentoring systems.
Figure 1.  The last time something happened online that bothered or upset you, did 
you talk to anyone of these people about it? (per cent yes, by country)
Comments:  9 to 17-year olds in all countries. In Bulgaria, Chile and Montenegro, representative national samples are used. Caution is 
needed for the findings from the Philippines and South Africa, which are based on pilot data; in the Philippines, the sample is very small. 
For methodological details, see www.globalkidsonline.net/results  
Multi-stakeholder discussions often express the hope or expectation that parents will 
take primary responsibility for child safety online. Parental mediation can be tailored 
according to the age, maturity, cultural or psychological circumstances of each child. It 
doesn’t limit adults’ freedoms online and it is cheap. Moreover, parents are already on 
hand, willing to play their role. But they also expect that their child’s school will offer 
them advice and safety education, and that the government will “police” the internet 
so that parental lapses in effort or effectiveness don’t have disastrous consequences.
In Europe, Insafe1, is the awareness-raising network for national centres that coordi -
nates the annual Safer Internet Day and provides parental guidance regarding the latest 
popular site or newest online fashion among children. Furthermore, there are numerous 
multi-stakeholder initiatives that draw together the combined expertise of educators, 
parenting groups, child welfare bodies, industry, and law enforcement (see, for example, 
the work of the ICT Coalition in bringing together the internet industry; Croll, 2015).
Coordinated, accessible, parent-focused efforts in the Global South are few and far 
between (Livingstone et al., 2017b). Although there are many parenting education pro -
grams in this region, very few address children’s online experiences. Integrating online 
issues into existing programs may be a way to reach more parents and address their 
needs holistically. Also likely to be useful is peer mentoring, given children’s preference  100

Parenting in the Digital Ageto turn to a friend for a support, especially when it comes to marginalized groups of 
children, e.g. children with disabilities or adolescent girls in societies where gender 
inequality undermines girls’ opportunities to benefit from ICT use. For instance, in 
Iraq provision of online resources allowed adolescent girls to access information, also 
linking them to peer-to-peer support networks where they could discuss issues usually 
considered private or taboo in their society (UNICEF, 2013).
Conclusion
We have drawn on the available and new research to argue that, in both the Global 
North and the Global South, while it is entirely appropriate to call on parents to play 
a key role since they are ideally positioned to address the particular “best interests” of 
their child, policies which leave the bulk of the responsibility to parents will find that 
this works better for relatively privileged families than for the majority, including for 
those particularly vulnerable or at risk, thereby leaving many challenges for the rest 
of society to address. The problems are multiple. First, parents are usually not the 
first people children wish to tell about their relational, emotional, or sexual concerns. 
Second, the internet is hugely complicated and fast-changing, making it difficult for a 
busy parent to grasp what children need to know. Third, some parents do not take on 
this responsibility, and they are “hard to reach” by awareness campaigns. Fourth, small 
minorities of parents are truly neglectful of or abusive to their children, making it inap -
propriate to rely on them to ensure their child’s safety. However, for those seeking to 
prevent or manage the risks of harm to children, it is important to empower all parents 
and to provide a safety net for circumstances of childhood vulnerability. 
Some trends in the Global North have implications for experience in the Global 
South. For instance, the growing understanding and willingness of parents to engage 
with their children’s internet use as they catch up with their early adopter children. 
Some trends in the Global South have implications for experience in the Global North. 
We can point the trend towards “mobile first” , replacing first use via desktop or laptop 
computer, which is now also spreading in the Global North, reducing parents’ ability to 
monitor their child’s internet use (Mascheroni & Ólafsson, 2015). Other trends invite us 
to recognise that, also in the Global North, some children escape parental oversight by 
going online outside the home, or lack reliable parenting or adult figures in their lives. 
The WHO five parental roles have resonance for families everywhere, for most 
parents struggle with the tension between protecting their children versus giving them 
the freedom to explore, learn and grow independently. In addition, most parents can 
be encouraged to draw on what they know about their child and the wider society, as 
often this knowledge is also applicable in the digital domain. Therefore, in considering 
the stakeholders supporting parents, there are questions about balance. In future, it 
will also be critical to include parenting in the digital age as a component of parenting 
programmes currently being offered in the North and the South and to evaluate them 28
Sonia Livingstone & Jasmina Byrnefor impact. Such examples of evidence-based programmes include Triple P or Sinovuyo 
Teen parenting programme (Haggerty et al., 2013; Cluver et al., 2018), indicating the 
positive impact of specific interventions in relation to parenting support. 
In seeking answers to these dilemmas, we would refer to the UN Convention on the 
Rights of the Child which clearly specifies that parents have the primary responsibility 
for childrearing, but it also places obligations on states and communities to support 
parents in these endeavours. It seems that the old saying “it takes a village to raise a 
child” still applies in a digital world. It’s just that the village is now both local and Global.

ABSTRACT
Eﬀorts have been made in recent years to ensure there is su ﬃcient
capacity within nation states to respond to, and combat, Online
Child Sexual Exploitation (OCSE). The UK-led WeProtect Global
Alliance initiative has outlined a Model National Response (MNR),to which a large number of nations have already committed.
OCSE, like cybercrime, is very often a crime with international
dimensions. If we could start again knowing what we know now
about OCSE, what would a model international response look like?
Does this help us identify gaps in the existing internationalresponse that can be opportunities for improvement? This article
maps an optimal international response to the problem of OCSE.
Drawing on and complementing the We Protect Global Alliance
Model National Response (MNR), it highlights aspects peculiar to
the international nature of OCSE and suggests areas for futureoperational coordination and research.ARTICLE HISTORY

Setting the scene - what is online child sexual exploitation (OCSE)?1
The group of criminal activities today commonly referred to as ‘online child sexual exploi-
tation ’may be most easily –if at times arti ﬁcially –categorised as content-related or
contact-related. Content-related activities have traditionally focused on the production,
distribution and possession of what is often called ‘child pornography ’in national legisla-
tive instruments and by the popular media, but which is classi ﬁed as ‘child sexual abuse
material ’by those working in child protection.2Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) may
be broadly de ﬁned, currently, as photographs or videos that depict children in erotic
poses; child nudity with focus on the genital area; and children engaged in sexual activity
–be this with peers, adults or alone.
Contact-related activities, meanwhile, can be classi ﬁed most simply as serious sexual
oﬀences against children, such as rape and sexual assault. While these o ﬀences are by
no means new, it is generally agreed that over the last 10 –15 years, mobile phone and
internet technologies have a ﬀorded much greater opportunity than before for individuals
to make contact with children for sexual purposes (Baines 2008 ; Quayle and Koukopoulos
2018 ; UNODC 2015 ).
This article considers international responses to the interrelated activities shown in

https://doi.org/10.1080/23738871.2019.1635178While due consideration has been given to some countries ’recent moves to criminalise
‘sexual chat ’between adults and minors, this is not included in the schema above due to
an absence of international consensus on its criminal status.
What are the goals of combating OCSE?
Researchers have used a number of approaches to assist in the formulation of response
measures to child sexual exploitation. Considering OCSE as a crime problem naturally
prompts responses whose chief objectives are crime prevention, detection and control.
This is an approach with which law enforcement intelligence analysts and child protectionspecialists will be familiar. Since the scope of this research is content and contact widelydeemed to be criminal, a response model focused on criminal justice and crime prevention
is therefore an obvious choice.
A growing number of researchers have proposed, as an alternative, the public health
model, which views OCSE as a societal problem.
3As Wortley and Smallbone ( 2012 )
explain, the public health model provides for three levels of prevention:
.Primary, targeting whole populations;
.Secondary, targeting at-risk groups; and
.Tertiary, targeting those already identi ﬁed as having a problem.
Existing prevention measures, such as online safety tools, awareness programmes and
removal of CSAM are population-based strategies that sit ﬁrmly within primary prevention
of OCSE.4Support services for those at risk of o ﬀending or victimisation would constitute
secondary prevention, o ﬀender treatment programmes and victim support tertiary
prevention.
Considering the wide range of activities shown in Figure 1, it seems helpful to develop
responses that combine both public health and criminal justice approaches, and to ensurethat speci ﬁc functions and measures are aligned to the following high-level goals:
Figure 1. Online Child Sexual Exploitation activities.2 V. BAINES.Protect children
.Control o ﬀending5
Under these functional headings can be housed an array of responses from the ﬁelds of
public health, criminal justice and crime prevention. For example, ‘protecting children’ can
describe the work of law enforcement o ﬃcials, social workers, and educators. ‘Controlling
oﬀending ’can be the work of prisons, but also of therapists providing support to individ-
uals seeking to manage their sexual interest in children. As the response to OCSE is cur-
rently organised at national and international levels, some stakeholders are actively
involved in both protecting children and controlling o ﬀending.
A related approach that sees OCSE as a commodity-based activity –be this in the form
of CSAM or o ﬄine contact with children and young people –would set the goals in the
context of economic theory, as follows:
.Reduce supply (of children for online and o ﬄine sexual contact, and of CSAM); and
.Reduce demand (for online and o ﬄine sexual contact with children, and for CSAM).
This is closer to some of the models applied to organised crime, which view illegitimate
business structures as functioning in a broadly similar fashion to legitimate business. Thecomparison is sound in so far as CSAM is commoditized (produced or distributed forpayment, or as a currency in itself) and in as much as production and distribution may
involve online networking of like-minded individuals.
OCSE conforms to the principles of supply and demand to some degree, but there are
diﬀerent emotional a ﬀordances at work, not least sexual gratiﬁ cation in many (but not all)
cases. Application of the organised crime model is stretched, particularly in those cases of
one-on-one sexual exploitation of a child where there is no ﬁnancial element, and no
apparent attempt to further commoditise CSAM produced. But even here, we may posit
that equipping children to avoid victimisation would help reduce levels of o ﬀending.
Closer parallels can be found in the online coercion of children and young people to
produce further self-generated sexual content, and the production of sexual content inreturn for inducements. In either scenario, the threat of public exposure or the promise
of gain helps to ensure compliance with an o ﬀender’ s wishes.
Each of the theoretical approaches discussed above can be used to inform the develop-
ment of e ﬀective responses to OCSE and to align with the two high-level goals of protecting
children and managing o ﬀending. The international response model proposed in this article
draws on them directly, presenting an ideal against which existing policy responses can be
measured, free from the constraints of established organisational structures.
The WeProtect global Alliance model national response (MNR)
The WeProtect Global Alliance is the result of the merging of two international initiatives tocombat OCSE: the UK-led WeProtect, launched in 2013, and the joint US/EU Global Alliance
Against Child Sexual Abuse Online, launched in 2012. It is ‘an international movement
dedicated to national and global action to end the sexual exploitation of children
online ’, and now counts 82 countries, 20 technology companies and 24 civil society and
international organisations among its members.
6JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 3The initiative ’sﬂagship document is the WeProtect Model National Response (MNR), the
intention of which is to ‘help a country evaluate its current response, identify gaps, prior-
itise national e ﬀorts to ﬁll those gaps and, by establishing a common set of aspirations for
all countries, enhance international cooperation ’.7It sets out 21 desired capabilities for sig-
natory countries8:

It is not the intention of this article to subject the MNR to a full critique, not least because
its professed scope of ‘Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse ’is wider
than online child sexual exploitation. Nevertheless, one can observe from the above that the
MNR groups responses variously, according to function (governance, communication),approach (societal, criminal justice), sector (industry) and individual stakeholder (victim).
From a methodological perspective it is therefore something of a hybrid, perhaps re ﬂecting4 V. BAINESthe complexity of the issue and of the measures already being delivered in countries whose
responses are deemed to be the most advanced or sophisticated.
By design, the MNR makes recommendations for national sovereign capabilities. But
since the majority of OCSE has an international component9, it may be asserted that
national capabilities alone are insu ﬃcient to combat OCSE e ﬀectively. As the 2018 WePro-
tect Global Threat Assessment acknowledges:
Solely focusing on a national level response will not meet the international challenges of this
global threat. Recognition of this fact is the ﬁrst step to developing more collaborative and
therefore e ﬀective approaches to safeguarding and justice.10
Accordingly, this article proposes a new model for responding to OCSE that outlines the
optimal response functions with particular focus on the international level.
An optimal international response to OCSE
Modelling method
A review was conducted of academic publications; grey literature, such as law enforcementthreat assessments and reports by non-governmental organisations; and open sourcematerial including public statements and media coverage. From this were identi ﬁed estab-
lished and emerging trends in OCSE, proposed approaches to combating them, progress todate and operational challenges. This in turn enabled mapping of both the functionsrequired for an optimal international response ( Figure 2 ) and the existing stakeholder
environment ( Figure 3 ). The free software SimpleMind was used to map the models.
11
Figure 2 was then circulated among professionals with specialist experience of combat-
ing OCSE in law enforcement, industry, non-governmental and other international organ-
isations. Review by this group validated the model, and a number of amendments were
made based on their feedback.12
The model
Figure 2 maps the functions identi ﬁed as optimal for combating OCSE e ﬀectively, in line with the
top-level goals of protecting children and controlling o ﬀending. The choice of a function-based
approach, rather than one based on stakeholders o r capabilities, is deliberate. The aim is to envi-
sion an ideal response informed by what we know about OCSE in 2019, independent of the
organisational structures hitherto developed to respond to the problem. It makes the assump-
tion that even the proudest and most partisan of stakeholders can identify things that couldhave been done di ﬀerently or better, had the various national and international responses to
OCSE not developed rapidly in reaction to a large and unforeseen increase in such crimes.
Consequently, this research does not take as a given that the existing structures for
responding to OCSE are optimal, even in those countries with the most extensive or soph-isticated provision.
Discussion
The model comprises a single global set of responses, to be delivered at national and inter-national levels to varying degrees. This approach has been chosen to maximise utility for
all specialist stakeholders and non-specialists alike.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 5Figure 2. Proposed international model for responding to Online Child Sexual Exploitation.6 V. BAINESMapping functions in this way highlights a number of aspects worthy of further con-
sideration. In the ﬁrst instance, viewing existing policy responses through a lens of the
ideal allows for the identi ﬁcation of gaps and opportunities for improvement. In the
second, numerous overlaps between functions make evident that none of them can
operate in isolation. For example, victim identi ﬁcation is an activity of law enforcement
in the course of a criminal investigation but may also be part of an international crisis
response in the event of a live instance of sexual extortion of a child.
The goal of controlling or managing o ﬀending sits across disruption, therapeutic
support, criminal justice and awareness/prevention to varying degrees. Technical measuresto prevent convicted o ﬀenders, or those exhibiting o ﬀending behaviours, from accessing
online services through which they can contact children; legal approaches that impose
oﬄine restrictions and requirements in order to reduce opportunity and therefore risk;
behavioural therapy and live advice from a helpline such as StopItNow!, may all assist an
individual at risk of o ﬀending against children to manage their own impulses. Law enforce-
ment initiatives such as the European Union ’s Police2Peer may seek to divert suspected
downloaders of CSAM towards support services by intervening directly on peer-to-peerﬁlesharing platforms.
13In order to be accurate and useful, Insight & Analysis will necessarily
rely on intelligence and information from all of the other functions.
Prevention is a fundamental theme of several of the top-level functions and numerous
response measures shown. It inevitably dominates the awareness/prevention responseslisted, especially target hardening, in the form of safety programmes for children and
their guardians, and capacity building, for educators and other practitioners coming
into contact with children, in accordance with the public health model of combatingoﬄine child sexual abuse; technical measures, for example age veriﬁ cation, can help to
ensure children have access to age-appropriate online environments and content,where their risk of sexual contact with adults can be reduced; and therapeutic providerscan also assist children in reducing their vulnerability to victimisation.
Some of the functions have less obviously international dimensions than others. Thera-
peutic support will, for the most part, be delivered at national level, but capacity buildingfor practitioners in this ﬁeld may well be provided by or under the auspices of international
organisations. Delivery of technical prevention and disruption measures at scale almost
always has an international dimension, not least when they are deployed on global
online platforms.
The international dimension of responding to OCSE is most evident in the Criminal
Justice and Crisis Response functions, where government authorities in one countryrequire the timely assistance of entities in another. Two scenarios will serve to illustratethe character and pressing nature of the challenges.
Criminal justice
The victimisation of a child in Country A is reported to the local police. In accordance withthe WeProtect Global Alliance MNR, Country A has a national specialist law enforcementunit dedicated to the investigation of CSE. Initial investigation reveals that the child has
been encouraged to expose themselves online to an unknown person. In order to identify
this person, police in Country A need to request data pertaining to their registration on,and usage of, several online services. A typical scenario would be for a request to be
made to a social media provider for the subscriber and login information for anJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 7account. This most often includes registration data, phone and email identi ﬁers attached
to an account, and IP addresses for recent activity. If the provider is based in Country A and
the data is stored there, domestic legislation will su ﬃce to compel the production of the
information sought in a timely manner. This is typically the procedure for requests to local
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) for metadata concerning home internet usage. If,
however, the provider is located and the data stored in another country, the legislationof Country A has no extraterritorial force to compel the data ’s production. This has histori-
cally been the case for law enforcement agencies outside the US seeking data from large
US-based online providers. The process is further complicated where cloud storage may
hinder attempts by authorities to identify the location of data at a speci ﬁc time (Gillespie
2012a , 358f.).
The importance of communications data to OCSE investigations is re ﬂected in its
inclusion in the regularly updated model legislation and global review of instruments pro-duced by the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (2016). Remedies
exist in the diplomatic sphere, most notably the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties
(MLAT) agreed between countries for bilateral assistance in criminal investigations. Butthe majority of these agreements were made before the mass adoption of internet tech-
nologies and the misuse of instant communication for serious crimes such as OCSE
(UNODC 2015 , 48). While some countries, such as the US, have exceptions that permit
emergency disclosure in circumstances indicating a threat to life or limb, on the whole,national legislations either do not provide for –or may strictly prohibit –direct disclosure
of personal data held in one country to government authorities in another.
14
Various initiatives are currently underway to modify individual agreements or inter-
national legislation. At the time of writing, the UK is seeking to conclude an agreement
with the US which will permit UK law enforcement authorities to request personal data
directly from US providers; the European Commission has announced plans for EuropeanProduction and Preservation Orders to enable member states to request data directly from
providers operating a service in fellow EU member states, and the recently enacted CLOUD
Act empowers federal US authorities to obtain data held by US companies on serversoutside the US.
15
Crisis response
The WeProtect MNR highlights the need for legislation that enables data to be requestedinternationally, including from third countries, but does not fully re ﬂect the complexity
inherent in that process, nor the speed at which OCSE can now be committed and become
life-threatening. Sexual extortion of children can rapidly progress from initial contact to
crisis. A child in Country A exposes themselves online at the request of an unknownperson. That unknown person threatens the child that they will publish the material receivedor recorded unless more (often more abusive) material is produced or monies are paid within a
short time, typically a couple of hours, a day at most. If the child has the courage to tell a parent
or guardian, this may be reported to the local police. In cases where the chief harm is causedby the publication of the CSAM, authorities may prioritise prevention and disruption over
identifying the o ﬀender. Country A has a national specialist OCSE unit as recommended by
the WeProtect MNR. The only identi ﬁers for the suspect relate to an account for a video
chat platform based in another country, Country B. The alleged victim is in crisis and hasexpressed suicidal thoughts. The most urgent priority is to locate the suspect account and8 V. BAINESremove the possibility for publication of the CSAM. Information will then be sought with the
aim of identifying and locating the suspect. If the suspect is located in a country other than
Country B, where possible, the information will be shared with authorities in that countryto assist in the suspect ’s apprehension and prevent further victimisation.
For authorities responding to OCSE, the above scenario is not uncommon. As will be
evident, there are several possible points of failure that could result in direct physical harmto the child. The child may not disclose but su ﬀer in silence; the parent/guardian may not
report to the police; local police may not understand the urgency of the situation; the
country may not have a specialist unit with key contacts in other countries and online provi-
ders; the online provider may not have the capacity or legal basis to respond to emergencyrequests from foreign authorities. Where disruption and harm reduction are successful, they
rely more on interpersonal relationships than on a tested or agreed process (UNODC 2015 ).
Practitioners and researchers alike have recognised the potential of sexual extortion for
psychological damage, self-harm and suicide.
16Crisis intervention has historically been
the remit of social workers and therapeutic providers and is a key feature of the increasingly
popular Barnahus inter-agency model for responding to child sexual exploitation andabuse.
17But in a hyperconnected world where children are encouraged to interface directly
with others on global technology platforms, ﬁrst responders may also be peers, parents,
helplines, hotlines, educators, law enforcement and online service providers –all of whose
actions may impact on the mental and physical wellbeing of a child in potential crisis. Thepublic health model requires a community response, and the internet-mediated public is
a global community. There is, therefore, an opportunity to establish an international and
multi-agency emergency response that reduces the immediate harm of OCSE for childrenin crisis, enabled by an agreed operational framework and resourced for rapid action.
It should be emphasised that crisis response is also necessary for OCSE o ﬀenders and
potential o ﬀenders. Individuals struggling to control, or come to terms with, their urges to
commit OCSE o ﬀences will often require urgent live support. Adequate resourcing for help-
lines is therefore essential to prevent harm to o ﬀenders, as well as reduce o ﬀending.
Why has a focus on crisis response largely been absent, to date, from strategies to combat
OCSE? A possible explanation lies in the fact that both legal measures and research have his-torically been focused primarily on CSAM and not on the full range of OCSE o ﬀences (Europol
2017b , 9). The requirement for criminalisation of non-image-based OCSE activities, such as
grooming, is a comparatively recent development. The Lanzarote Convention, enacted in2010, and the 2011 EU Directive on Combating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation
of Children and Child Pornography, are the landmark international instruments in this
regard.
18In 2019, some signatory countries are yet to ratify the convention and fully transpose
the directive into their national legislations. Continued policy focus on technical measures for
eradicating CSAM is well founded, aimed as it is at reducing supply and revictimisation,
improving practitioner resilience and coordinating responses. But its emphasis on ﬁles,
rather than live scenarios involving children, has not kept pace with the changing methods
of victimisation. There is a further opportunity to recalibrate international responses to
ensure they meet the goal of protecting children (Phippen 2017).
Legislative measures alone cannot ensure a timely international response to OCSE
emergencies. Human capacity is required to maintain international relationships, not
only within national law enforcement authorities, but also in the companies receiving
emergency requests for assistance. The major US tech companies publish transparencyJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 9reports that include statistics on the number of data requests they receive from each coun-
try’s law enforcement agencies. These numbers do not necessarily include the number of
times a company is called upon to disrupt or prevent OCSE, or the time taken to build
relationships often with multiple law enforcement o ﬃcers in every country policing OCSE.
Recent recommendations by the European Commission that EU member states desig-
nate Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) for data requests to US providers will doubtless bewelcomed by online service providers, and this re ﬂects the identi ﬁed need for greater
coordination in international evidence gathering, including in relation to OCSE. This is
especially the case for smaller providers who may lack the capacity and resources to
assist global law enforcement to the extent of the large global technology companies.
19
Insight and analysis
The MNR identi ﬁes research, analysis and monitoring of child sexual exploitation and abuse
(CSEA) as a desired capability: ‘Action to prevent and tackle CSEA is intelligence and evi-
dence-led. The nationally-agreed view is used to inform the development, prioritisationand implementation of the country ’s CSEA response and related policy and practice ’.
20
The ability to review progress and adapt responses to changes in the operating environmentis no less important at international level, given the transnational nature of Online ChildSexual Exploitation. Just as the MNR highlights that legal de ﬁciencies in one country may
lead to crime displacement
21, so too do trends in victim and o ﬀender behaviours and
also good practice in protective measures need to be shared globally, and in a timelyfashion, to ensure consistent and e ﬀective responses across countries and sectors.
Advances in international research and analysis of trends in OCSE have, to date, been
sporadic and largely sector-speci ﬁc. Notable examples of international law enforcement
analysis of OCSE include the Virtual Global Taskforce (VGT) Environmental Scan, an assess-
ment of trends in OCSE based on the contributions of law enforcement specialists in VGT
member countries and organisations.
22First produced in 2008 for the World Congress III
Against the Sexual Exploitation of Children, it largely re ﬂects trends as observed in law
enforcement workloads and includes consideration of possible future developments,
demonstrating a level of foresight not required by the WeProtect MNR.23
In terms of international reach, the VGT assessments are perhaps the most representative, but
they are representative only of the VGT members hip (including EU member states via Europol).
They cannot be said to accurately re ﬂect African law enforcement ’se x p e r i e n c eo fO C S E ,f o r
instance, since no African country is a VGT m ember. Other research, such as Europol ’sInternet
Organised Crime Threat Assessment ,r eﬂects law enforcement ’s assessment of OCSE in a speci ﬁc
geographical region.24Further phenomenon- or capability-based analyses add to our under-
standing, including those of the various ﬁnancial coalitions on commercial OCSE, the US National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children on sexual extortion, the International Center for Missing
and Exploited Children on legislation, ECPAT International and Interpol on CSAM, and the Cana-
dian Centre for Child Protection ’sInternational Survivor ’s Survey.25What has been lacking is analy-
sis that synthesises these ﬁndings into a global assessment, with regular updates.
There is therefore an opportunity for a truly international and multi-stakeholder assessment
of OCSE that enables all countries and sectors to anticipate risks and threats on a regular basis.
In this respect, research and analysis has an important role to play, not only in reporting andlearning, but also in the primary and secondary prevention of OCSE. This is no small undertak-
ing given the number of countries to be surveyed –Interpol member countries alone number10 V. BAINES192. The MNR ’s recommendation for national research and analysis capabilities would
perhaps go some way to ﬁlling these gaps and generating the necessary data, if all 82 WePro-
tect Global Alliance countries were to commit to their establishment. As recent strides in the
coordination of victim identi ﬁcation illustrate, technology can assist the international coordi-
nation of the ﬁght against OCSE. Just as Interpol ’s International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE)
database now enables investigators, hotline analysts and other authorities to focus on uniden-tiﬁed children by ﬂagging material already investigated by the international law enforcement
community, so too can technological tools automate at least part of the process of data gath-
ering and qualitative and quantitative intelligence analysis.
The WeProtect ( 2018 ) Global Threat Assessment is the most recent move towards ﬁlling
this analytical gap. Furthermore, it highlights the need for ‘consistent global assessment of
the threat from CSEA and its impact ’and to ‘keep up with the changing nature of such a
diverse, complex and fast-moving threat ’.
26Beyond general reporting of projected smart-
phone adoption, however, its foresight is currently limited.27
Cross-cutting challenges and enablers
A number of prerequisites underpin the delivery of the optimal international response to
OCSE mapped in Figure 2.
International coordination
International coordination is perhaps the most prominent theme of this research. Theabove discussion of crisis response highlights the need for fast-time international and
multi-stakeholder coordination. At an investigative level, international coordination
ensures essential information exchange and evidence gathering, often despite legalobstacles. It also streamlines operational activity, minimising duplication of e ﬀort and
avoiding cross-contamination by multiple law enforcement authorities. At the strategic
level, international coordination can target capacity building where it is most needed
(Gillespie 2012a , 359) and enable both measurement of impact and sharing of valuable
insights. The problematics of international coordination relate to ownership and leader-
ship. When it comes to OCSE, national sovereignty is not the only challenge. As UNICEF
(2011 ) notes, ‘The borderless nature of the Internet makes it hard for both national govern-
ments and inter-governmental agencies to speak directly to what has now become a
highly di ﬀuse and widely dispersed set of interests ’.
Legislation
Legislation is required speci ﬁcally at international level to ensure approximation or harmoni-
sation of criminal o ﬀences; a common understanding on jurisdiction and extraterritoriality;
and to provide for evidence gathering and information exchange, amongst other aims.28
As discussed above, legislation can itself pose a challenge in urgent situations where swiftinternational responses are required. At a strategic level, instruments such as the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Lanzarote Convention, the 2011 EU Direc-tive and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child set international standards
in this regard to which communities and advocacy groups can hold governments to account.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 11A presumption of partnership
Mapping functions rather than stakeholders has revealed that the majority of the
optimal international response activiti es rely on the contribution of more than one
stakeholder, and, in some cases, several. For example, while criminal investigation isthe natural preserve of law enforcement , feedback contributors noted that non-
governmental organisations, including hotlines for illegal material, child helplines andﬁeld missions, play an active role in identifying o ﬀenders and victims. Accurate analysis
of victim and o ﬀender behaviours will necessarily requ ire the sharing of information and
intelligence between governments, industry and non-governmental organisations. In acrisis response scenario involving the publication of CSAM, law enforcement, platformproviders, hotlines and helplines may all be active in removing the immediate harm
to a child. As Figure 3 illustrates, the international st akeholder environment for OCSE
is complex.
In full recognition of the challenges of ownership at international level, UNICEF ( 2011 )
has called for ‘a collective e ﬀort by policymakers, law enforcement agencies, social
workers, teachers, parents and the private sector to systematically protect children ’.
Until now, the public discourse in relation to OCSE has often characterised this collective
eﬀort as a series of one-way relationships. As Phippen ( 2017 ) observes, the dominant
policy response in some countries has been to look to technology to solve a societalproblem. This is echoed in media coverage of the relationship between some governmentauthorities and online platform providers, where the tone is more often punitive than
collaborative.
29
The question of progressing OCSE stakeholder relationships from cooperation to part-
nership is not merely semantic. Cooperation, as outlined in the MNR and currently prac-tised by stakeholders in the ﬁght against OCSE, is predominantly transactional: for
example, industry or hotlines reporting illegal material to law enforcement, law enforce-
ment asking industry for data or to remove material, non-governmental organisationsreporting intelligence in the ﬁeld to the relevant parties. Cooperation gives every stake-
holder a role, but not necessarily an equal voice. True partnership in the ﬁght against
OCSE, in which all stakeholders have a part to play in shaping the response –not just in
delivering it –would arguably engender not only greater ownership and investment
from individual stakeholders, but also more innovative solutions in the interests of protect-ing children and controlling o ﬀending. The involvement of all stakeholders is also in the
spirit of the public health model for crime prevention. To this end, following a survey of
practitioners in multiple sectors, Davidson et al. have identi ﬁed the need for ‘a real
joined up partnership ’between law enforcement and industry that is ‘visible, functional,
eﬀective and seen as legitimate ’, and ‘the development of systematic policing and industry
collaboration ’.
30
Communities and constituents
To the stakeholders identi ﬁed as professional contributors to the ﬁght against OCSE must
be added also the ‘targets ’of these responses. Smallbone, Marshall, and Wortley ( 2008 )
identify four ‘essential targets for preventing child sexual abuse: victims or potential
victims; o ﬀenders or potential o ﬀenders; situations in which sexual abuse has occurred
or is likely to occur, and communities ’.12 V. BAINESFigure 3. Select stakeholder groups in the ﬁght against online child sexual exploitation. Note: this map is not exhaustive and is intended to serve solely as an illustration of the
complexity of the stakeholder environment. Omission or inclusion on the map should not be interpreted as indicative of any weight or value of contribu tion.JOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 13Article 3.1 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that ‘In all actions
concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions,
courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of thechild shall be a primary consideration. ’Accordingly, UNICEF ( 2011 ) advocates for a
child-centred approach to online child protection, and there have been numerous callsfor law enforcement and criminal justice responses that are child-friendly.
31Asﬁndings
of the EU Kids Online project have consistently demonstrated, asking children whatbothers or upsets them online reveals diversity in how children feelabout OCSE-related
experience in di ﬀerent countries and socio-demographic contexts, often challenging par-
ental and policymakers ’perceptions of the problem (Livingstone et al. [ 2011 ], [2012 ],
[2014 ]).
Support services for children and child participation in the development of policy and
practice are key features of the MNR. Not so evident in the models to date are the voices ofoﬀenders and potential o ﬀenders. Approaching OCSE as a public health problem, rather
than a problem of public order, requires listening to o ﬀenders and potential o ﬀenders –
what works, what does not, their particular challenges and methods –in order to
develop preventative measures that are e ﬀective because they are representative.
To date, public discourse has shown itself to be intolerant, if not hostile, to OCSE o ﬀenders
and potential o ﬀenders. This is understandable, but potentially counterproductive to the
goals of protecting children and controlling o ﬀending, and has in turn made such support ser-
vices as there are even more essential for the health and wellbeing of o ﬀenders and potential
oﬀenders. Altering the public discourse in relation to o ﬀenders generally would seem to be
important, but particularly so in respect of juvenile o ﬀending and its prevention where
there is a recognised knowledge gap.
32Acknowledgment of the intersection between
target groups, namely that a child can also be an o ﬀender, should lead stakeholders to ques-
tion further the mainstream media ’s insistence on the demonisation of o ﬀenders.
Technology
Technical solutions play a role in several components of the optimal international
response to OCSE and are already used by several stakeholders including law enforce-
ment, platform providers and hotlines for illegal content (NetClean 2018 ; UNODC 2015 ).
To date they have been deployed most extensively in the processes of detecting and
removing CSAM, and in the investigation of OCSE by law enforcement authorities,
where they assist in the prioritisation of cases and victim identi ﬁcation.
Hashing of known Child Sexual Abuse Material with a unique signature for each image
has enabled platforms to automatically identify and report attempted uploads. This hasbeen seen as an important step forward for companies willing to demonstrate due dili-gence, with the added bene ﬁt that such measures aim to minimise revictimisation of chil-
dren and young people by reducing the ongoing circulation of identi ﬁed material. The
practice is largely adopted by US companies, in line with a national statutory reportingobligation. Hash sharing and related technologies also improve personnel resilience, inindustry, law enforcement and hotlines, by reducing the amount of material that needs
to be manually reviewed.
Given the identi ﬁcation above of gaps in relation to international crisis response, insight
and analysis, and timely evidence gathering across jurisdictions, it is reasonable to suggestthat automation of some tasks may improve responses in these areas.14 V. BAINESPolitical will
The international response to OCSE relies on adequate funding by nation states. Without it,
individual countries risk becoming hotspots in the production and distribution of CSAM –
be this by live streaming, online solicitation or other means, as a location for suspects,victims or both. A number of countries around the world could already be said to be in
this situation due to lack of resources. Their lack of response in turn weakens the inter-
national community ’s ability to combat the problem, creating a perception of ‘safe
havens ’and additional victims and suspects in other countries.
Support from international organisations in the form of ad hoc training or donated
equipment can only ever be a small part of a country ’s response to the problem. This is
a key message of the MNR: establishment of the desired functions outlined for signatory
countries necessarily entails the provision of funding for national specialist law enforce-
ment units, hotlines/helplines and so forth. Logic suggests that political will shouldresult in the allocation of resources, but in the ﬁeld of OCSE, the relationship appears to
be more complex. There is currently no publicly available information on the progressof signatory countries towards implementing the WeProtect commitments. It is evident,however, that many signatory countries have made no obvious progress towards theestablishment of specialist law enforcement units, youth awareness campaigns or thera-
peutic support for victims and o ﬀenders.
Whether their basis is political, charitable or focused on enforcement, international
organisations have a role to play in lobbying for change, political will and increasedresources. This in turn can enhance coordination and reduce duplication of e ﬀort, again
ensuring that resources are distributed where they are most needed.
Concluding remarks
OCSE is a complex and dynamic phenomenon. The optimal international response pro-
posed in this article and the subsequent discussion cannot hope to cover all aspects ofthe topic in the detail they deserve, nor was this the intention of the research. Rather, it
is anticipated that the relevant stakeholders will take forward the various items worthy
of further consideration.
In deliberately choosing to map the gold standard for combating OCSE in all its forms at
international level, the research highlights opportunities for improvement in all countries.Based on assessment of the current state of o ﬀending and victimisation and contributions
from stakeholders, it is reasonable to assume that no one country would boast su ﬃcient
law enforcement resources or ongoing therapeutic support for o ﬀenders and victims.
From the international perspective, the most obvious gaps to be transformed into
opportunities are in:
.Establishment of a procedure for fast-time response to OCSE events in which childrenand young people experience crisis;
.Streamlined cooperation and information exchange in the realm of criminal justice; and
.Regular insight and analysis that ‘future proofs ’OCSE responses as far as possible.
In terms of a general global strategy, the author has asserted that greater international
coordination and true partnership across stakeholder groups have the power to createJOURNAL OF CYBER POLICY 15more e ﬀective and innovative countermeasures whose secondary impacts are foreseen.
Mapping of currently observed and emerging OCSE activities in particular has cast light
on interdependencies between them. These in turn suggest that an optimal internationalresponse is one that approaches OCSE holistically, rather than focusing on a single aspect
or activity, and as both a crime problem and a public health issue.
The author is duty bound to acknowledge that the discussion in this article is inevitably
coloured by her own professional experience combating and analysing OCSE in law enfor-
cement and industry and working closely with non-governmental organisations. Every
attempt has been made to ensure that the perspectives of all relevant stakeholder
groups were included in the research, not least by soliciting feedback on the optimal inter-national response. It is hoped that this article will prompt further stakeholder and public
debate on how OCSE is tackled globally.

Notes
1. Throughout this article, and in this section in particular, attention has been paid to the termi-
nology used to describe activities deemed to be Online Child Sexual Exploitation. Reference
has been made to the terminology guidelines produced by ECPAT Luxembourg/ECPAT Inter-national ( 2016 ), to ensure the use of appropriate and recognised terminology wherever
possible.
2. Those seeking to consign ‘child pornography ’to obsolescence quite rightly draw attention to
the implication of consent in the use of the term ‘pornography ’, which does not accurately
reﬂect the status of the material in question as a record of a sexual assault.

Key insights  
• Risk classifications guide  practitioners and 
policymakers in their work  and in 
communicat ing their results . EU Kids Online’s 
(2009) 3Cs of online risk  is used widely  as a 
classic point of reference  for stakeholders 
internationally.  
• It is time ly to update th is classification , given 
the variation  in its use, the emerging risks in the 
digital environment , and our growing  
understandi ng of children’s experiences of 
online risks  of harm . As part of our CO:RE work 
on theories and concepts, we: 
o reviewed existing classifications of online 
risk to childre n by UNICEF, the International 
Telecommunication Union ( ITU), 
Organisation for Economic Co -operation 
and Development ( OECD ), Council of 
Europe  (CoE)  and others ; 
o consulted  European practitioners of child 
internet safety  from Insafe and INHOPE to 
build on their experience .  
• This report propose s a new CO:RE 4Cs 
classification , recognis ing that online risks 
arise when a child:  
o engages with and/or is exposed to 
potentially harmful CONTENT ; 
o experiences and/or is targeted by potentially 
harmful CONTACT ; 
o witnesses, participates in  and/or is a victim 
of potentially harmful CONDUCT ; 
o is party to and/or exploited by a potentially 
harmful CONT RACT. 
• The 4Cs classification also distinguishes 
between aggressive, sexual and value risks , 
as this is helpful in retaining a balanced view of 
the range of risks that children can encounter. 
We note that risks to the values that shape 
 
1 See https://core -evidence.eu/understanding -children -
online -theories -concepts -debates/   childhood and society are increasingly 
prominent.  
• In addition to the 4Cs, the new CO:RE 
classification recognises im portant cross -
cutting risks , notably  to children’s privacy, 
health and fair treatment . 
• Keeping in mind  that children’s online 
opportunities  are paramount, and that a host 
of individual and societal protective and 
vulnerability factor s mediate between risk 
and harm, we hope that the new classification 
is insightful for research, policy and practice  
that contribute s to realising children’s rights  
in relation to  the digital environment (UN, 
2021).  
Understanding online risk  
In the CO:RE p roject, our work on theory examines  
the key concepts that frame the field of research, 
policy and practice . The aim is to bring  together 
diverse perspectives and interrogat e their 
underlying assumptions in order to contribute to the 
collective ambition of understanding the 
experience s and consequences of growing up in a 
digital world.  
A comprehensive understanding of children’s 
engagement with the digital environment requires  a 
balanced consideration of both risks and 
opportunities, recognising the full range of 
children’s rights in a digital world (UN, 2021). Within 
this broader frame (Livingstone, 2016), r isk is one 
of the key concepts identified for investigation by 
the CO: RE Consortium,1 and is the focus of this 
short report.  
In a fast -changing  digital eco system , the nature of 
risk is continually evolving, sometimes exposing 
children to emerging risks well before adults know 
how to mitigate them. Risk has been defined as:  
Uncertainty about and severity of the 
consequences (or outcomes) of an activity with 
respect to something that humans value . 
(Aven & Renn, 2009 , p. 1)   
[4] The clash of possibly severe outcomes with human 
values inevitably raises concerns, and the digital 
environment, in which children are often very active, 
adds heightened uncertainties into the mix. No 
wonder that online risk is one of the most contested 
areas of children’s digital experience, concerning 
many stakeholders and posing pressing challenges 
for research, policy and practice.   
These challenges include understanding children’s 
exposure to different types of online risk, and how 
regulatory, technica l, social or individual 
interventions can be effective in  developing 
strategies to cope with risk, mitigating or minimising 
any harmful consequences.  
From the outset, it is vital  to distinguish between 
online risk and harm . Conceptually, risk is the 
probability of harm , while harm i ncludes a range of 
negative consequences to the child’s emotional, 
physical or mental wellbeing  (Livingstone, 2013) . 
For example, e xposure to pornograp hy poses a risk 
to a child, but it is not a certainty that there will be 
harmful consequences . 
Harmful outcomes depend on the nature of the risk 
(whether it is more probable or more severe in its 
consequences ) and on the design , regulation  and 
managem ent of the digital environment  (privacy 
settings, moderation services, access to helplines 
etc.). They  also depend on the child and their 
circumstances , because what is problematic  for one 
child might not  be so for  another. Such differences 
reflect societal factors (norms and regulations, 
political priorities, economic investments, education 
and family systems, etc.) as well as the individual 
protective or vulnerability factors that differentiate 
among children (including age, gender, digital skills, 
resilience , personality , socio -economic situation  
and family context ).  
It is paramount that our understanding of online risk 
is evidence -based, prioritising robust research 
conducted with and in relation to children .2 Our 
understanding should also be informed by 
children’s own views and experiences, a nd those of 
practitioners responding to child online risk and 
safety problems, rather than assuming or imposing 
a vision grounded in adult normative expectations 
or popular  anxieties.  
 
2 See OECD (2011); UNICEF (2017); Smahel et al 
(2020).  In this short report we critically examine how online 
risks have been  classified  in order to develop  a 
better understanding of children’s online 
experiences  and their potential or actual real -world 
consequences . After discovering  how existing 
classifications have been adopted in the work of 
various stakeholders, we p ropose a new 
classification  of online risk to children to meet the 
challenges of a changing digital environment and 
the practical imperatives of policymakers and 
practitioners.  
This new classification highlights four dimensions 
related to the positioning of the child in the digital 
environment , and shows how these intersect with 
three dimensions  regarding t he nature of the risk . It 
also recognises the  cross -cutting dimension s of 
priva cy, discrimination  and health risks.  
The 3Cs of online risk  
A comprehensive classification of online risk was 
proposed by EU Kids Online in 2009  (Staksrud & 
Livingstone, 2009; Staksrud et al., 2009 ), funded by 
the European Commission’s (EC) Safer Internet 
Programme (now the Better Internet for Kids 
Programme).3 It was originally developed to answer 
the often -asked questions regarding ‘What risks are 
we talking about ?’ and ‘Why should policymakers 
take action ?’ It sought to disaggregate risks and 
raise awareness of the wide array of risks affecting 
children, including , but also going beyond , the main 
emphasis on pornography, grooming and 
cyberbullying that dominated the agenda at the 
time.   
Taking a ch ild-centred and evidence -based 
approach, EU Kids Online’s classification  identified 
two dimensions of risk: the positioning of the child 
in relation to the digital environment (as a recipient 
of mass -produced content, a participant in adult -
initiated activ ity, and an actor in peer -to-peer 
exchanges), and the nature of the risk (aggressive, 
sexual, values and commercial).  
This classification took a strongly child -centred 
approach. It highlighted that children should not be 
treated as solely vulnerable victim s or protected at 
all costs, including at the cost of their online 
3 www.betterinternetforkids.eu/nl/      
[5] opportunities. The idea was to recognise children’s 
agency as actors in a digital world, but without 
holding them unduly responsible for risks online or, 
especially, for the at -times harmfu l effects on their 
wellbeing or that of others. As will be seen later, the 
revised CO:RE classification recognises the child’s 
perspective and agency but also the power of 
societal and digital infrastructures to shape the 
child’s experiences and outcomes.  
The original classification was tested using data 
from EU Kids Online’s two -wave European survey 
with internet -using children aged 9 –16 conducted in 
2010 (Livingstone et al., 2011) and 2017 –19 (Smahel et al., 2020). It has been incorporated into 
the Global  Kids Online model and its surveys of 
children in 18 countries (Livingstone et al., 2019). 
Taken together, these projects have generated 
cross -nationally comparable data from 40,000 
children in more than 35 countries, providing an 
evidence base to inform p olicy priorities and 
establishing a baseline against which socio -
technical change and policy interventions have 
been positively evaluated ( Morton et al., 2019) .4 
Figure  1 shows the classification with exemplar 
risks in the cells.5 
Figure 1: The EU Kids Online original 3Cs classification of online risks (Livingstone et al. , 2011)  
 
Adopting the classification  
The 3Cs classification became a classic point of 
reference since 2010 , much cited by the 
policymakers and practitioners working to maximise 
children’s online opportunities and minimise their 
risks of harm.  
To trace its use, we conducted a search for mention 
of ‘co ntent, contact and conduct risks’ online and 
among reports and documents by relevant 
organisations. We found that the 3Cs of online risk

balance risks and opportunities, a parallel classification 
was proposed for opportunities, although it was little 
noted (Livingstone et al., 2018).  have informed the work of a range of key actors, 
albeit not always with a direct source, including 
UNICEF, the European  Commission (EC), the 
Organisation for Economic Co -operation and 
Development (OECD), the Broadband Commission 
for Sustainable Development  (2019) , the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)  
(2020) , the ICT Coalition  (O’Neill, 2014; Croll, 
2016) , and ot hers (O’Neill & Dinh, 2018; Green et 
al., 2019) .6  
One use is to classify the plethora of problems 
reported by children who call helplines. Supported 
by the EC’s  Better Internet for Kids programme, the

Intern ational, the European Union Agency for 
Fundamental Rights (FRA), GSMA, INTERPOL, Child

[6] work of the Safer Internet Centres (SICs) provide s 
helplines across Europe : 
Helplines provide information, advice and 
assistance to children, young people and 
parents on how to deal with harmful content, 
harmful contact (such as grooming) and 
harmful conduct (such as cyberbullying or 
sexting) . (O’Neill & Dinh, 2018, p. 68)  
Relatedly, the EC’s self -regulatory initiative, the 
‘Alliance to better protect minors online’,7 called on 
businesses to tackle ‘existing  and emerging risks 
that children and young people face online, 
including: harmful content (e.g. violent or sexually 
exploitative content); harmful conduct (e.g. 
cyberbullying), and harmful contact (e.g. sexual 
extortion)’.8  
UNICEF’s flagship annual publication The state of 
the world’s children  focused in 2017  on children in 
a digital world , and also used the classic EU Kids 
Online classification, recognising that while it is vital 
to address online risk, some degree of risky 
opportunities can afford children the chance to learn 
and become resilient, depending on their maturity 
and circ umstances  (UNICEF, 2017) . 
Undoubtedly, wh at has proved most valuable  are 
the definitions  of the 3Cs, as  illustrated  in Figure 2. 
It is noteworthy that most uses of the classification 
refer to just one of the two dimensions (the child in 
relation to the digital environment) and discuss 
content, contact and conduct. Thus, they often omit 
the second dimension – the nature of the risk 
(aggressive, sexual, values, commercial) – and, 
perhaps in consequence, the exemplar risks 
highlighted and researched by EU K ids Online, 
among other researchers (Stoilova et al., 2021). 
Without the second dimension, however, 
commercial risks became somewhat neglected, 
leading to calls for revision of the original risk 
classification given rising evidence of the 
importance of com mercial online risks to children.

market/en/alliance -better -protect -minors -online    
8 This framing is problematic in eliding risk and harm, 
because it is precisely in the gap between them that Figure  2: The 3Cs of online risk (UNICEF, 2017)  
Content risks : Where a child is exposed to 
unwelcome and inappropriate content. This can 
include sexual, pornographic and violent images; 
some forms of advertising; racist, discriminatory or 
hate speech material; and websites advocating 
unhealthy or dangerous behaviours, such as self -
harm, suicide and  anorexia.  
Contact risks : Where a child participates  in risky 
communication, such  as with an adult seekin g 
inappropriate  contact or soliciting a child  for sexual 
purposes, or with  individuals attempting to 
radicalize a  child or persuade  him or her to take 
part in unhealthy  or dangerous behaviours.  
Conduct risks : Where a child behaves  in a way 
that contributes to  risky content or  contact. This  
may include  children writing  or creating  hateful 
materials about  other  children, inciting racism or 
posting or distributing sexual images, including 
material  they have  produced  themselves.  
Contract risks : the fourth ‘C’  
Digital technologies have developed significantly 
since the original typology was created , and the 
online ecology affords new opportunities but also 
new risks for children, particularly in relation to 
commercialisation and datafication. To respo nd to 
these changes and to reintroduce more prominently 
commercial dimensions of online risk, a fourth ‘C’ 
(variously labelled ‘contract ’, ‘commercial ’ or 
‘consumer ’) has been suggested.   
In a 2018 redevelopment of the EU Kids Online 
classification, the fo urth ‘C’ is conceived not as a 
commercial risk , but as a ‘contract’ risk that directly 
or indirectly connects children and digital providers. 
This reflects  the dramatic rise in the 
commercialisation of children’s personal data, 
arguably resulting in the ‘d atafication’ of children 
themselves (Mascheroni, 2020).   
With the 4Cs, EU Kids Online has proposed not only 
a classification but also a digital ecosystem of online 
risks in which children are variously positioned and 
in which the different risks interact in increasingly 
many empowering and safety interventions focus their 
efforts (e.g. digital literacy).    
[7] complex ways. This informed the CoE’s  Handbook 
for policy  makers on the rights of the child in  the digital environment  (Livingstone et al., 2020), as 
shown in  Figure 3. 
Figur e 3: The EU Kids Online 4Cs model of online risks (Livingstone et al., 2020, p.  57, adapted from 
Hasebrink et al., 2018)  
Most o bviously , contract risks arise  when the child 
‘accepts’ (including unintentionally, involuntarily or 
unknowingly) the Terms of Service (or Terms and 
Conditions) of a commercial provider  of digital 
products or services . Such contractual 
arrangements can bind the child in ways that may 
be unfair or exploitative, or which pose security or 
safety or privacy risks of which they may be 
unaware or over which they have little control or 
means of escape. Related risks arise because of 
the data processed by public and third sector 
organisations, as well as through a host of public –
private partnerships (Stoilova et al., 2020) .9 The 
Broadband Commission observes that children :  
… have no way of understanding what they 
were signing up for when they installed the app 
or logged on to the site. Services and 
obligations that are designed for adults must 
be age -limited — so that children cannot sign 
up to them without a guardian’s permi ssion… 
While online, children also risk spending 
money without permission of parents or 
caregivers and having their data harvested . 
 
9 This data may be given by or taken f rom children’s 
digital activities, as well as inferred or assumed about 
them, or about others connected with them, through 
profiling operations. The fast -growing data ecosystem 
now provides an infrastructure not only for commercial 
transactions impacting o n children but also for the digital (Broadband Commission for Sustainable 
Development, 2019, p. 34)  
In short, c ontract risks arise when children use 
digital services as well as when they are  impacted 
by digital transactions conducted by others in other 
ways ( e.g. through institutional uses of digitised 
databases that include the child’s profile, or 
algorithmic processing of personal data relating to 
the child or others connected with them ; see O’Neill, 
2014 ; 5Rights Foundation, 2019 ).  
In naming this category of risks ‘contract risks ’, we 
note the legal difficulties linked to contracts 
involving children, as well as the fact that users (of 
all ages) can  be unaware of the contractual nature 
of their relationship with digital service providers. 
We also note that the contract that occasions a risk 
may not be with the child but with their parent or 
school or indeed, between a service provider and a 
third par ty, among other possibilities in the complex 
digital ecosystem. Nonetheless, on balance, we 
propose that the label ‘contract ’ is helpful in pointing 
to a mix of marketing, data processing and other  
contractual risks that merit specific attention , most 
products and services that afford content, contact and 
content risks. The result is that the types of risk are 
increasingly interlinked, as are the solutions – e.g. data 
protection regulation can prevent some interperson al or 
social forms of online harm (Stoilova et al., 2020).  
  
[8] but not all of which are commercial, and some of 
which are still emerging . 
Cross -cutting risk s  
Even with the fourth ‘C’, there are dimensions of 
online risk that might not fit neatly into these 
categories. UNICEF’s State of the World’s Children 
participatory workshops  (UNICEF, 2017) revealed 
that children  report concerns about risks that do not 
fit well with the classification, such as technological 
problems and parental  intrusion in their online lives. 
In its draft Recommendation  on children in the 
digital environment , the OECD observe s that: 
…the nature of existing risks have significantly 
changed, and a number of new risks have 
emerged. Technological developments and 
new business models have contributed to the 
change in digital devices and services, which in themselves have also contributed to  the 
evolving risk landscape . (OECD, 202 1, p. 4) 
Do we need to go beyond the 4Cs and add new and 
cross -cutting elements?  Recognising that digital 
service providers need to know which risks are of 
greatest concern so that they can innovate in safety  
by design, and building on multi -stakeholder 
consultation  (5Rights Foundation, 2019) , the OECD  
recently propose d that some risks are seen as 
cross -cutting in nature – such as those related to 
privacy, advanced technological features (e.g. 
Internet of Things [IoTs] , artificial intelligence  [AI], 
biometrics, predictive analytics), health and 
wellbeing.  
Note that the O ECD  builds on the EU Kids Online 
classification, although it defines the fourth ‘C’ as 
‘consumer risks ’.10 The second dimension of the 
figure lists ‘risk manifestations’ (or examples of 
ways in which children might encounter potential 
harms online ), although it does not organise them 
further . This is shown in Figure 4.  
Figure 4: Children in the digital environment: revised typology of risks  (OECD, 202 1) 
 
10 The OECD’s proposed category of consumer risks 
includes four manifestations: (1) marketing risks; (2) commercial profiling risks; (3) financial risks; and (4) 
security risks.  
 
Practitioner re flections  
To discover how practitioners working in the field of 
child online protection classify risks, and whether 
they consider that revisions to the 4Cs are needed, 
in October 2020 we conducted an online workshop 
with 125 members from the Insafe and INHOPE 
networ ks from over 20  countries.11 
The consultation sought to:  
• Identify familiar and emerging online risks  
affecting children across Europe , and to see 
whether these are common across or specific 
to different contexts or countries.  
• Consider whether classifications of online 
risk are adopted in practice and useful , and 
if so, what purpose they serve and what the 
strengths and shortcomings of the avail able 
classifications  are.  
Insafe and INHOPE members contributed a series 
of reflections on the risk classification and its 
possible development .12 After a lively discussion, 
there was widespread agreement that risk 
classifications are useful for practitio ners. 
Practical purposes of the classification of online 
risks include:  
• Identifying the range and diversity of risks , 
including identifying emerging risks . 
• Making comparisons  and capturing trends  
across risks and across time/contexts . 
• Systematically c ommunicating results  and 
priorities to expert , policymaker  and lay 
audiences . 
• Highlighting the need for resources , budget s 
and training . 
• Classifying the types of risks reported via input 
from helpline s and complaints mechanisms .  
• Targeting planning, interventions and 
awareness -raising  campaigns . 
 
11 See 
www.betterinternetforkids.eu/practice/articles/article?id=6
745701    • Mapping evidence to risk categories and 
identifying evidence gaps . 
In practice, some organisations will always generate 
their own classifications – for instance , when 
working bottom -up from helpline calls to track local 
trends – while others will not need to classify risks in 
their work.  
Overall, however, t he consensus was that it is 
valuable to have a shared approach to answering 
questions such as ‘ What do we mean by online 
risks?’ and ‘ Which risks are emerging ?’ or ‘ Which 
should be prioritised ?’ and ‘ How is my country doing 
compared with  others? ’ 
For researchers, the classification is useful in 
providing a common terminology by which to report 
and review findings, and for mapping where 
evidence is sufficient and where there are pressing 
gaps. As for practitioners, researchers also 
repeatedly find that  risks intersect, bridging offline 
and online experiences, and compounding adverse 
outcomes for the more disadvantaged or vulnerable 
children. But we can only report such complex 
relations among risks if we first identify those risks, 
so the classification  remains useful.  
It was also generally agreed that , to be  useful , risk 
classifications should prioritise : 
• Flexibility – the c lassification has to be broad 
and flexible so that new risks can be added 
when needed or when we need to refer to 
different groups of children or address 
stakeholders.  
• Clarity  – the risks should not overlap with each 
other and they should map readily onto the 
reports from children or practitioners about 
problematic experiences . Recognising that this 
is a complex domain, the call was also to avoid 
oversimplification, recognising ‘hybrid threats ’ 
that could be classified in more than one 
domain (e.g. identity theft could be linked to 
contact, conduct or contract risks depending on 
the circumstances ; online pressures relating to 
body image can have both sexual and value 
dimensions ; see Figure 6). 
• Examples  – to be readily understood and 
applicable to the practical work, including real -
12 For detailed findings, see Livingstone et al. (2021).    
[10] world examples in the cells of the classification  
table is important. While it is recognised that the 
examples provided cannot be comprehensive, 
they should map onto the actual problems 
reported by children or encountered by 
practitioners. They should also  resonate with 
audiences (parents, policymakers, etc.) when 
risk-related work is made public.13  
Two structural changes to the online risk 
classification were recommended:  
• Inclusion of the fourth ‘C’ – this is needed , 
and it was widely thought that the term 
‘contract’ is more inclusive than ‘commercial’ or 
‘consumer’ risk s in recognising that risks can 
arise when the child is party to a contract with 
public and third sector organisations as well as 
commercial bodies, especi ally with the 
prevalence of public –private partnerships in 
complex digital ecologies.  
• Cross -cutting risk s – the recognition of risks 
that cut across several or all of the 4Cs was 
also agreed, although much debated. Again , 
this arises because of  the complexity of the 
digital ecology and also because risks are 
interrelated, and they can affect  multiple 
dimensions of a child’s experience. The effects 
on children’s  health (e.g. health risks linked to 
excessive screen use ) were  raised by multiple 
contributors.  So, too, were the array of privacy 
risks experienced by children online, many of 
which arise from data processing (and so can 
be classified as contract risks) but that can also 
arise in relation to content, and through 
interpersonal contact and conduct . 
Even a fter discussion,  different views remained 
regarding:  
• Country specificities  – should the 
classification differ by country and context to 
recognise  different legal, regulatory and 
cultural factors that shape children’s exposure 
to risk? It emerged, however, that pan -
European commonalities are more notable 
 
13 In this regard, the ‘risk manifestations’ in the OECD 
classification were found to be difficult to interpret both 
because they are abstract and yet overlappin g, and 
because the legal/illegal boundary varies by 
country/policy context. Relatedly, the idea of cross -
cutting technological risks was not taken up, possibly 
because all online risks have a technological dimension 
or because the examples given in the OEC D typology than country  differences , and are often more 
worth y of attention given the benefits of sharing 
insights and best practice across countries , and 
in working towards common solutions.  
• Extending the classificati on with a fifth ‘C’ – 
a range of possibilities was suggested, 
including that the classification could identify 
the consequences  of risk, such as health or 
wellbeing, or other abuses of children’s rights; 
and/or distinguish illegal (‘criminal’ ) from 
harmful risks. However, t his discussion threw 
up the many differences not only by country 
(e.g. in which online risks are illegal) but also 
organisational sector, type and purpose. It was 
agreed, therefore, that although 5Cs may be 
useful on occasion, this should be left to each 
country or organisation to determine for itself.  
The new CO:RE classification  
We propose a  new CO:RE classification  of online 
risk, learning from the above experiences and from 
consultation with the CO:RE Consortium. Risk is 
recognised as relational, emerging from the 
dynamic interaction between the child’s agency and 
the agency of others opera ting in the digital 
environment (including through automated 
processing such as algorithms  and as embedded in 
digital design and operation ).14  
The 4Cs of online  risks of harm are content, contact, 
conduct and contract risks, as explained in Figure 5 . 
The classification has the merit, we suggest, of order 
and clarity. We believe it to be fit for purpose, 
recognising the multiple positions that children may 
occupy in an increasin gly significant and powerful 
digital environment, including continually emerging 
online risks. It is orderly and clear, and it provides 
practitioner -tested exemplars of key risks, including 
those that have become familiar in recent decades 
and those that a re emerging and new.  
The introduction of contract risks as the fourth ‘C’ 
incorporates risks previously labelled ‘commercial’.  
are linked most closely to contract risks or again, to 
privacy or discrimination.  
14 This framing of the 4Cs overcomes the previous 
potential for misunderstanding (e.g. the implication that a 
child may participate willingly in contact abuse, or t hat 
they are mere receivers of content rather than also 
actively seeking it).    
[11] Figure 5 : The CO:RE 4Cs of online risk  
• Content risks : The child engages with or 
is exposed to potentially harmful content. 
This can be violent, gory content, hateful or 
extremist content, as well as pornographic 
or sexualised content that may be illegal or 
harmful, including by being age -
inappropriate. Content  online may be  
mass -produced or user -generated  
(including by the child) , and it may be 
shared widely or not.  
• Contact risks : The child experiences or is 
targeted by contact in a  potentially harmful  
adult -initiated interaction, and the adult 
may be known to the child or not. This can 
be related to harassment (including 
sexual), stalking, hateful behaviour, sexual 
grooming, sextortion or the generation of 
sharing of child sexual abuse material.  
• Conduct risks : The child witnesses, 
participates in or is a victim of potentially 
harmful conduct such as bullying, hateful 
peer activity, trolling, sexual messages, 
pressures or harassment , or is exposed to 
potentially harmful user communities (e.g. 
self-harm or eating disorders). T ypically 
conduct risks arise from interactions 
among peers, although not necessarily of 
equal status.  
• Contract risks : The child is party to and/or 
exploited by potentially harmful contract  or 
commercial interests  (gambling, 
exploitative or age -inappropriate marketing, 
etc.). This can be mediated by the 
automated (algorithmic) processing of data. 
This include s risks linked to ill -designed or 
insecure digital services that leave the child 
open to identity theft, fraud  or scams . It 
also includes contracts made between 
other parties involving a child ( trafficking, 
streaming child sexual abuse ).  
• Cross -cutting risk s: Some risks relate to  
most or all of the four categories  and can 
have multiple manifestations across the 
different dimensions (aggressive, sexual, 
values). These include online risks relating  
to privacy, physical or mental health, 
inequalities or discrimination.  Hence the new classification now distinguishes 
three dimensions in relation to the nature of the risk: 
aggressive, sexual and values. It is noteworthy that 
interest in value -related r isks (e.g. misinformation, 
radicalisation, self -harm, algorithm bias) has grown 
in recent years, now attracting as much attention 
and anxiety as aggressive and sexual risks.  
Finally, the new classification recognise s three 
types of cross -cutting risk  – to children’s privacy, 
their health, and their fair treatment and equal 
inclusion in a digital world. These risks, we suggest, 
can occur in relation to any and all of content, 
contact, conduct and contract risks  (see Figure 6).  
Importantly, it should be noted  that, although some 
risks are particularly cross -cutting in nature, many of 
the online risks to children intersect and hybridise , 
depending on the circumstances, and more so  as 
the digital environment evolves . Hence the 
classification and its exemplars ar e offered here as 
a way of organising  and opening up further 
investigation, rather than as implying that  risks are 
simple or disconnected.   
Figure 6: The CO:RE classification of online risk to children  
Conclusions   
We hope this new classification  serves  constructive 
purpose s for researchers, policymakers and 
practitioners working to minimise or manage online 
risks to children ’s rights and wellbeing . The 
classification offers the foundations of a better 
understanding of online risk to children, and it can 
underpin the work of different stakeholders:  
• Policymakers can use it to identify what risks 
matter and why, what evidence supports them, 
and how they fit within or fall outside existing 
regulatory  frameworks.  
• Parents and the public can use it to learn what 
can be done about the different risks and what 
to look out for.  
• Researchers can use the classification  to 
develop comprehensive definitions and 
 
15 We sought to future -proof the classification by 
describing risks in broad terms rather than focusing on 
very particular or time -bound risks, although we measures of online risk , and to organise, 
compare and report findings . 
• Practitioners can use it in their work  to classify 
and understand the problems reported to 
them, to communicate with different 
audiences, and to manage and bid for 
resources.  
The classification will need careful framing for 
different a udiences , so more work needs to be done 
on implementation . Moreover, as society  and the 
digital environment continues to change, the 
classification will need revisiting in the future.15  
It should be noted that our  focus has been on 
children online, leaving others to attend to the 
important risks of not being online  – digital 
exclusion, struggles for access and connectivity, 
lack of digital skills, and so forth . 
We did not  focus on the factors that account for 
wheth er, when or why some children are more likely 
to encounter particular online risks than others, nor 
the protective or vulnerability factors – whether 
appreciate they arouse concern (e.g. sharenting, 
influencers, deep fakes, viral challenges).  
  
[13] concerning children, their circumstances, the digital 
environment or its regulation and management – 
that account for harmful outcomes. Again, this has 
been amply addressed elsewhere.16  
It is also important to see risk as only one of the 
dimensions of children’s online experiences, 
alongside opportunities and among many factors 
that intersect to influence children’s outcomes 
(Livingstone, 2016). Indeed, while  the digital 
environment affords children a range of risks , it also 
offers many opportunities to benefit , and this merits 
a parallel analysis. If society becomes 
overprotective, it  can inadver tently undermin e the 
very opportunities for which society provides 
children with internet access. We will address the 
4Cs of online opportunities in our future work.

Effectiveness of Digital Platforms to Reduce VAW  
Dr Erika Fraser  and Caroline Enye          31 January  2019 
Query:  What is the evidence on the effectiveness of digital platforms (e.g. soap operas, radio 
programmes, Facebook, Apps, YouTube and Instagram) to reduce violence against women?  
Purpose:  To test a soap opera approach to drive behaviour change to address deeply ingrained 
socio -cultural norms that enable very high levels of VAWG in Bangladesh. Reaching women and girls 
through traditional outreach and training has had some impact, but digital technology presents an 
opportunity to increase and widen our reach.   Digital and mobile phone penetration is high in 
Bangladesh particularly amo ng young people.    At this stage we envisage the soap opera would 
primarily target young people (16 -25 years), with the scripting of the story youth -led and broadcast on 
digital platforms used by young people in Bangladesh . 
 
1. Introduction  
Traditional and digital  media1 platforms  can be important a pproaches to reach young people  with 
social messaging, with huge potential to transform harmful  social norms around gender and violence 
through public discussion and social interaction. However, these tools are not without risks and 
challenges.  This document  provides a rapid review of the evidence on the effectiveness of digital 
platforms , including  soap operas, radio programmes, Facebook, Apps, YouTube  and Instagram,  to 
reduce violence against women and girls (VAWG).  As these digital platforms  are still relatively new, 
this query  also includes any evidence on the effectiveness of more traditional me dia approaches (e.g. 
radio, television).  This report begins by setting out the methodology and strength of the evidence base 
(Section 2), before pulling out the key lessons from the evidence on the effectiveness of digital 
platforms to reduce VAWG (Section  3).  Further details on case studies are provided in Annex 1.  
 
2. Methodology and evidence base  
The review prioritised existing syntheses where possible in order to draw on the fullest range of 
evidence possible , given time constraints.  
Search strategy : Studies  were identified through searches using Google and relevant electronic 
databases (PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar ) for priority sources. Key search terms 
included: soap opera, radio, television, TV, Facebook, Apps, YouTube , Instagram, technology, digital 
AND violence against women, GBV, rape AND adolescent, youth, young people.  
Criteria for inclusion : To be eligible for inclusion in this rapid mapping, studies  had to fulfil the 
following criteria:  
• Focus : Research, evaluations and studies of digital platforms  and soap opera programmes  to 
reduce violence against women  
• Time period : 2000 – January 2019.  
• Language : English and Portuguese.  
                                                           
1 Traditional media refers to television, radio and print media . DFID refers to the word ‘digital’ within its strategy  (2018b)  as 
“the tools, techniques, technology and approaches of the internet age”.   Typically , digital media is used to describe internet  
forums, blogs, wikis, podcasts, and social media applications (e.g. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook)  
VAWG Helpdesk Research Report       No. 224  2 
 • Publication status : publicly available – in almost all cases pub lished online.  
• Geographical focus : low and middle -income countries, but opened up to high -income countries in 
areas where evidence was lacking.  
Overall, the evidence base on the effectiveness of digital platforms and media programming to 
reduce  VAWG is limited , according to DFID’s (2014) How to Note on Assessing the Strength of 
Evidence, i.e. moderate to low quality studies, medium size evidence body, low levels of consistency. 
The most rigorous studies are over ten years old (e.g. Soul City in South Africa;  Programme H in 
Brazil ) or currently awaiting results (e.g. Change Starts at Home in Nepal) . Most  other  studies are  
either  low-quality observational studies  or are based primarily on monitoring data on the reach of a 
programme – for example, h ow many viewers or listeners, rather than impact . The few systematic 
reviews that exist on VAWG  point to the scarcity of high quality, rigorous research  in this area, and 
particular ly a lack of  research measuring  changes in violent behaviour  or experiences  of VAWG (Fulu 
et al, 2014; Trabold et al, 2018 ). 
There is particularly limited data on the effectiveness of digital platforms , partly due to this 
being a relatively new approach  and the rapidly evolving technological context . Various apps 
and online tools have been developed, but these are mostly not evaluated. There is also an e vidence 
gap in understanding t he effectiveness of different approaches for women and girls who are 
particularly vulnerable  to violence online and offline , such as adolescent girls, women  and girls  with 
disabilities , and young people of diverse sex ualities and gender identities (Faith and Fraser, 2018).

3. Lessons learned about the effectiveness of digital platforms to reduce VAWG  
Designing programme activities  
• Traditional and new media, including  digital platforms , show some promise in driving 
behaviour change around VAWG , but research suggests that it should be linked with  more 
intensive engagement via  offline activities and local action . Key lessons include the 
importance of providing  opportunities for young people  to put new norms and behaviours into 
practice. I n India , a soap opera whose themes include acid attacks and d omestic violence - Main 
Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon (MKBKSH) — I, A Woman, Can Achieve Anything  used a 360° 
communication approach across a wide range of communication platforms2 to engage the 
audience. As part of this, it formed 738 community outreach groups.3 Research found that the 
groups were spurring interpersonal conversations  beyond the group , for example 48% of group 
                                                           
2 Including a television and radio serial, an interactive voice response system, social media outlets, and on -the-ground 
activities.  
3 The programme partnered  with 10 NGOs in the states of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh to infuse MKBKSH viewing/listening 
with community outreach groups: 202 groups in 3 Districts of Bihar and 536 groups in 5 Districts of Madhya Pradesh.  These 
groups were called Sneha Groups, named afte r Dr. Sneha, the protagonist in the soap opera.  4 
 members reported talking  about the issues raised in the soap opera  to family, 37% to friends, and 
13% to frontline health or social workers (Wang, and Singhal, 2017) . In India, Bell Bajao  found that 
mobile video vans, accompanied by staff and youth advocates, were extremely effective in 
mobilising communities a nd enabled the public to ask questions about domestic violence and 
women’s rights  (Breakthrough, 2011) . In Nigeria, Voices for Change (V4C) observed  that people 
that had physical interaction with the programme had the most intense change, but that others who 
were targeted indirectly through mass media also sometimes reached a position from where they 
are able to act on gender inequality: “brand/mass m edia campaigns are an important part of 
creating change but may not be enough, by themselves, to create profound change in most cases. 
Rather, they can create the conditions for further influencing by those that experienced intensive 
inputs – they are the next generation of low -hanging fruit” (Milward and Nelson, 2017: 5).  Other 
examples of media/digital programmes involving ‘offline’ discussion groups include Soul City 
(South Africa), Change Starts at Home (Nepal), Programme H and Entre Nós  (Brazil and bey ond), 
and Somos Diferentes, Somos Iguales We Are Different, We Are Equal (Nicaragua)).  
• Evidence suggests  the type of communications platform  (visual vs. verbal)  appears to play 
a role in influencing behaviour change , although further research is needed and  attributing 
change within a multi -media programme can be complex.  Data from Nigeria’s V4C programme 
found a difference in attitude and behaviour associated with hearing the media talk about violence 
against women in the Purple Tinz (radio show) versus seeing violence portrayed in the media.  This 
suggests that seeing or hearing depictions of violence can reinforce harmful descriptive norms, the 
sense that violence is common and acceptable. In contrast,  hearing violence being discussed 
provides lis teners/viewers the space to analyse and challenge their own perceptions  and harmful 
norms  (see box below) . 
Influencing Behaviour Change: Lessons from DFID’s Voices for Change (V4C) programme  
Whilst the results are not clear -cut and there is more to learn about how to effectively use mass 
communications, communications platforms which specifically created space for discussion and 
interrogation were shown to be particularly effective . For example , findings from V4C suggests 
that seeing more scenes of violence against women portrayed on TV/radio corresponds with higher 
VAWG (perceptions and behaviour), whereas discussion of VAWG on TV and the radio correlates 
with a decline in VAWG at home . This hy pothesis is consistent with findings from V4C’s qualitative 
surveys where interviewees credited discursive spaces as being particularly influential in the 
development of new ideas and shifting personal attitudes and behaviours.  
The impact of online content is mixed.  Evidence generated by V4C finds that individuals 
participating in the Purple Academy and Purple online (Purple E -Spaces) felt more willing to speak up 
against violence . Yet, findings from  V4C show very different results from light versus intensive web 
engagement . People with intensive  online  Purple Academy exposure (completion of a module) 
reported four to eight times greater change in their support for gender equality, including their 
willingness to speak up against VAWG, compared to thos e with general Purple Academy recognition. 
Analysis of the Attitudes, Practice and Social Norms Survey  (APSN ) results suggest that people who 
had only light exposure to online Purple content are consuming digital media from a much broader 
range of sources as well – and this wider online engagement is different  from people who have no 
exposure to online Purple con tent. This matters because, simultaneously with programming online, 
there were many other spaces and forums where gender was being discussed in unmoderated, and 
often negative, ways.

 Storylines and m essaging  
• Storylines and m essages should be piloted with target audiences  to ensure they are 
understood correctly and to minimise any unintended negative effects (Avis, 2017). The evaluation 
of Soul City soap opera in South Africa highlighted the importanc e of formative research with both 
audiences and experts to develop and field test storylines and materials to ensure their 
effectiveness. DFID’s V4C programme also gained valuable lessons about messaging, both in pre -
test and in the annual communications r eview. At the launch of the brand, whilst users found the 
Purple brand appealing and the communications relevant, there was no association with gender 
equality. This resulted in the programme re -branding to ‘Purple: 50/50’ (the 50/50 suggesting 
gender equa lity) which created a dramatic shift in users understanding of the core brand message  
• The most effective messaging is tailored to audiences using social marketing principles 
and creating a supportive environment  that enables the intended audience to make c hanges 
(Avis, 2017). – e.g. by mobilising communities in support of the campaign. For example V4C’s 
Purple 50/50  lifestyle brand unified communications encouraging a sense of a wider gender 
equality movement r ather than disparate activities  (V4C, 2017 a and 2017b ). Identifying how 
gender equal ity and non -violent behaviour will benefit the audience was at the core of 
communication.  
• Programmes should avoid reinforcing harmful descriptive norms4 that VAWG is widespread 
and instead look to reinforce protective norms or put positive norms in place . For example, 
in Nicaragua, Paluck and Ball (2010) note that it appears possible that the plot of the television 
series and radio call -in programme Somos Diferentes, Somos Iguales (We are Different, We are 
Equal)  may have reinforced negative descriptive norms, such as the perception that sexual and 
physical abuse are widespread problems. By advertising how common a problem is, there is a risk 
of norma lising this behaviour.  For example , in Nigeria  positive messages  around self -fulfilment, 
career success and loving romantic relationships were developed from V4C’s research into the 
values young people held. The meta -narrative of gender equality within rel ationships was 
promoted by the Purple 50/50 tagline , creating a sense of identity as a 50/50 person who will be 
the best they can be and support others to reach their full potential.  
• It is also important to channel individuals into opportunities to act on messages , such as 
supporting and advertising a hotline to report violence . For example, Soul City in South Africa 
partnered with a national toll -free helpline with online counsellors and a comprehensive national 
database to refer callers to ongoing support at community level  - approx imately  180,000 calls 
were answered on 4 lines over 5 months. When raising awareness or trying to change social 
norms, it is an ethical imperative to ensure that details of local support services are accessible for 
peopl e who have experienced violence (see later section on safeguarding).   
• A single brand identity unifies communications, encouraging wider sense of a movement 
for change. For example, the Girl Effect programme developed different brands in close 
association w ith girls: Ni Nyampinga in Rwanda (meaning “the beautiful girl – inside and out – who 
makes good decisions” in Kinyarwanda) and Yegna in Ethiopia (“ours” in Amharic). In Ethiopia, the 
Yegna brand focuses on a branded edutainment package (radio drama, talk show, music, and a 
network of Yegna ambassadors who hold weekly ‘listening parties’) that creates a platform to have 
a national conver sation about some of the cultural norms holding girls back, such as violence 
against girls. Nigeria’s V4C ‘Purple’ brand was effective in its ability to attribute  individuals ’ change 
and to which particular media platform  through the annual Social Norms At titude and Practice 
Survey, The findings informed programming choices to maximise impact and value for money.  
                                                           
4 Descriptive norms are what people think other people do  6 
 • Saturation (or intensity ) of messaging is key to changing behaviours. For example, research 
in Burkina Faso on using radio  programming  concluded that up to ten messages a day are 
required to be able to scientifically prove a subsequent related change in behaviour ( Murray et al, 
2018 ). However, such high -intensity broadcasting is challenging to achieve in practice ; instead the 
study  recom mend s developing messages across a range of channels - short 60 second 
advertising spots combined with longer dramas and opportunities to interact.5 
 
Broadening a ccess to digital platforms  
• Rigorous research can help identify which  communications platform s are most accessible 
and used by the target audience. National data may be out -of-date or not disaggregate by 
factors such as gender, age, religion/culture, disability. Small scale pilots can help with 
understanding diversity and i nclusion.  
• Evidence suggests that it is also  important  not to rely solely on digital platforms – the most 
effective programmes provide alternative options to ensure young people who are not digitally 
connected are not being left behind :  For example,  in Br azil, Promundo’s Entre Nós (""Between 
Us"") radio soap opera aired on community radio and was broadcast in places you ng people  
frequented - schools, beauty salons, cyber cafes.  In rural Sierra Leone,  Media Matters for Women 
(MMW) broadcasts a udio podcasts at 15 Listening Centres that MMW  builds and manages 
through community promoters in and around towns6, often attracting around 100 -200 people  to 
hear the weekly broadcasts.  
• People with disabilities can face particular barriers to accessing traditional and digital 
media . DFID’s Strategy for Disability Inclusive Development 2018 -23 notes the importance of 
considering the differential needs of girls and women with disabilities, and ensuring they can 
access the same opportunities to participate  (DFID, 2018a) . No examples were found during this 
query  of media or digital tools  on VAWG which have considered the needs of people with 
disabilities. DFID have highlighted various  ways tha t digital technologies can overcome barriers , 
includ ing: voice recognition, magnification, and text -to-speech functionality for people with visual, 
cognitive, learning, and mobility disabilities; text messaging, telephone relay, and video captions 
for pers ons with hearing and speech disabilities; and hands -free navigation and gesture -controlled 
interfaces for people with severe mobility impairments  (DFID 2018b; World Bank, 2016) . 
Programmes can also work offline with Disabled People’s Organisations  (DPOs)  to reach people 
with disabilities who cannot access digital platforms. Further advice and information can be 
accessed  at DFID’s new disability helpdesk.7  
 
Working with young people  around digital platforms  
• Formative research is important in understanding how young men and women use different 
digital platforms. In Nigeria,  V4C’s (2017c)  legacy paper  on using digital8 spaces noted  that 
young people  often  engage for short periods of time, while they  multitask  with other activities, view  
different sites at once, messag e friends, as well as being regular interrupted  by bad connection s. 
Programmes need to take these habits into account when designing content  for digital platforms  
and when evaluating impact.

8 Note that V4C findings refer to digital (online/mobile) only. Usage of radio, tv e tc is less complex.  7 
 • Co-creation with young people is important to get the content and messaging right. For 
example, the ‘Springster’ online mobile -first platform (formally Girl Effect Mobile) was ‘designed for 
and created by g irls’. Girl readers submit their own stories via a monthly ‘Your Words’ contest, and 
connect with each other using features such as commenting threads, polls and reactions.9 In 
DFID’s V4C programme in Nigeria, young people were engaged in a ‘user experienc e and content 
design workshop’ to design the look, feel and initial content of the ‘I am Purple’ website  and 
employed young people as core staff to support content creation and moderate social media.  
• Young people engage in different ways  depending on their age  - evidence suggests it is 
important to o ffer a range of age-appropriate opportunities. In India, Must Bol used creative 
digital media platforms for young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it. 
Must Bol f ound that different online activities attracted different age groups ; photo contests 
attracted young er people, whereas a blogathon attracted an older group (Liou, 2013) . 
• Evidence suggests that m usical and artistic approaches  are effective ways of  engaging 
young people, as are celebrities and other influencers .  In Brazil, Entre Nós soap opera was 
accompanied by a set of comic books and a soundtrack. In Viet Nam, celebrities participated in a 
digital  campaign  ‘Love Journey’  by being ‘models’ in a s ample photo essay, creating a campaign 
music video and writing songs on healthy relationships that they performed at a musical concert.  In 
Ethiopia, Girl Effect created the Yegna girl pop group to accompany a ra dio drama and talk show 
that championed the potential of girls.  In Nigeria, popular musicians created a music video, 
supported the campaign through live appearances and promoted Purple through their social media 
channels.  
• Challenges  to engaging young people around digital platforms  to prevent VAWG include  
literacy, cultural norms, only reaching certain young people who have access to digital technology, 
as well as risks to privacy and safety (see following section) (Avis, 2017).  For example: V4C 
Purple mobile platform had consistently lower numbers of young women engaging on the site, 
closely reflecting the national statistics of male/female online users (M 77%, F 33%). Additional 
investment went into women targeted advertising a nd content that spoke directly to young women. 
As a result overall user numbers dropped but resulted in almost equal number of male and female 
users: (M 51%, F 49%). Whilst being equally popular and relevant amongst the wealth groups, the 
purple radio show  was most successful in reaching the lower wealth quintiles  (Denny  and Hughes , 
2017)  
 
Safeguarding  
• Risks with digital (mobile/online) spaces need to be carefully planned for, monitored and 
mitigated against.  Risks associated with the use of digital platforms include  trolling, grooming and 
abusive content , as well as risks to digital privacy  – all of which need to be carefully managed and 
mitigated. For example, the V4C Purple website and social media platforms were closely 
monitored for signs of backlash and abuse, and in response to abusive content posted on the 
Facebook page, a number of users were banned from the platform.    
• Importance of moderators  and rules  to ensure digital  space s are safe for young people  – 
For example, the closed Facebook group ‘Female in Nigeria’ (Fin) (with over a million members) 
gets hundreds of applications for posts every  day but they are managed and approved by a group 
of 28 volunteers. About 40 -100 make it on the page.  It also has strict rules, including not judging 
each other, removing negative comments, and no religious -themed advice (“Fin is not a place of 
worship” ). 
                                                           
9 For more information, see: https://www.girleffect.org/what -we-do/mobile -platforms/springster/   8 
 • Ensure digital  platforms  provide a way for young people who have experienced violence to 
access support. For example, in Nigeria, the V4C Purple website featured a dedicated page with 
links to organisations and services for survivors of VAWG. In South Africa, Soul City partnered with 
a national toll -free helpline staffed by counsellors.  
 
Monitoring and Evaluation  
• Monitoring and evaluation of traditional and digital  media approaches to reduce VAWG 
remains a key evidence gap , where investment is needed to avoid the risk of programmes 
being unable to demonstrate impact. Of the 17 examples reviewed for this query, only  nine had 
evidence of impact  on attitudes and two on violence perpetration or victimisation . DFID’s (2017) 
review of the VAWG portfolio cautioned of the risks for innovative DFID media programmes which 
are not able to demonstrate impact (e.g. attracting ne gative public attention and being shut early).  
• Evaluations of traditional and new media programmes often generate complex results, 
which can take time to interpret . Both Somos Diferentes, Somos Iguales  in Nicaragua and  V4C 
in Nigeria found mixed  changes in attitudes, behaviours and norms relating to VAWG, which var ied 
by geographic and programming areas . In Nigeria, there was strong evidence that V4C has 
brought about significant change amongst individuals who engaged in phy sical and virtual Safe 
Spaces, targeted trainings and mass media communications . 
• Evidence suggests the most effective programming builds in opportunities for learning and 
adapting in response to audience feedback and wider changes in the political and socio -
economic context. In Nepal, the DFID -funded ‘Change Starts at Home’ programme w hich aims to 
reduce intimate partner violence between married couples uses  Listening and Discussion Groups10 
to ensure that the radio drama content is relevant and applicable, as well as to explore issues in 
greater depth. Listener reactions and feedback ar e shared with the radio production team to guide 
the content of future episodes, and adapt messaging accordingly (Clark et al, 2017).  
• Digital  platforms can provide transparent and accessible mechanisms to generate real time 
beneficiary feedback at scale, c lose feedback loops and provide a ‘pulse check’ for offline 
activities. For example, the Indian soap opera Main Kuch Bhi Kar Sakti Hoon (MKBKSH) — I, A 
Woman, Can Achieve Anything  (2014 - present) pioneered the use of an Interactive Voice 
Response System ( IVRS) which provided a discussion forum for viewers and a way to share 
feedback. The IVRS platform had 1.7 million calls from more than 390,000 unique phone numbers 
across 29 out of 36 India’s states. Independent analysis of the IVRS data noted that IVRS w as 
reached “media dark” areas through Mobile Vaani networks and Community Radio Stations, giving 
voice to less privileged audience members: “No media initiative, anywhere in the world, has 
received such a high level of audience participation in real time a t such a scale” (Wang and 
Singhal, 2017: 1)  
 
Costs and V alue for Money  
• High upfront costs are often incurred by programmes using digital platforms and 
communications approaches  to allow for design, testing and adaptation, according to a review of 
DFID’s VAWG portfolio. It also noted that the timeframe needed to achieve social norm change, 
and the front -loading of inputs can skew Value for Money assessments in the early stages of 
programming (VAWG Helpdesk, 2017). So while costs may come down over time , it should  also 
be noted that costs may increase in subsequent years if additional investments are needed to 
                                                           
10 2 male and 2 female groups per study site meet weekly for 39 weeks  9 
 develop the intervention, based on programmatic learnings, as was the cas e with V4C in Nigeria.11 
More costing information is forthcoming in 2019 from DFID’s What Works to Prevent VAWG 
research programme.  
• Digital platforms can be resource intensive during implementation.  For example, in India, the 
Must Bol  digital campaign for young people12 noted that they needed more staffing. During the last 
quarter of the campaign, when both on - and offline work was the strongest, there were only three 
full-time people working on the campaign – a larger group would have been much better (Liou, 
2013).  In Cambodia, a key lesson f rom DFID and Asia Foundation ’s support to three mobile apps 
which aim to end violence against women13 is that apps often have hidden costs, requiring 
investments to maintain complex backend systems and websites. It is therefore important to fully 
understand from the outset the process and the time /cost  requirements involved , as well as 
whether any other s imilar digital platforms exist which could be adapted.  
• Costing studies of soap opera approaches have calculated  low unit costs , due to the large 
number s of people reached. For example, South Africa’s Soul City soap opera cost US$0.23  per 
person reached by television, US$0.07  per person reached by print media, and US$0.01  per 
person reached by radio  (in 2000). These low costs were  largely due to the massive reach of the 
programme ; Soul City 4  (the series on violence against women)  reached 82% of the population in 
South Africa . 
• However, data  on unit costs  should be used with caution  as other approaches may have 
more evidence of effectiveness . Evidence reviews have concluded that although edutai nment 
approaches may have lower unit costs per beneficiary, they are not necessarily more cost -effective 
than more intensive activities such as community mobilisation (e.g. S ASA! in Uganda ) (Fulu et al, 
2014).  
 
Sustainability and  scale -up 
• Schools and educational institutions provide entry points to scale up programming for 
young people, as well as offline discussions.  For example,  in Brazil,  Promundo began 
collaborating with the  Education Secretariats and schools in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Bah ia 
to adapt and integrate Entre Nós (""Between Us"") radio soap opera into the public education sector. 
Similarly,  in China,  the 17 Man campaign united more than 100,000 students across top 
universities campuses in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hunan, in both digital and virtual 
activities.  In Viet  Nam, the Department of Education supported Love Journey activities  in schools.  
• There are several examples of promising practice in partnering with private sector 
organisations to leverage distribution networks a nd expertise in social marketing, branding 
and communications. For example, in Ethiopia, Girl Effect  partnered with the leading water 
company – Ambo Mineral Water – to further publicise the Yegna brand . Ambo Water printed the 
Yegna logo and programme schedule of the Yegna radio show on the stickers of five million 
bottles, as well as on 20 Ambo trucks. Distribution of the bottles was mainly targeted at girls in 
                                                           
11 For example, V4C’s unit costs of social media reach was £0.31 per person reached by social media (Y1), decreasing to 
£0.02 (Y2), £0.01 (Y3), but then £0.171 (Y4) . However, other parts of the programme came down consistently, for example 
the physical safe space costs (Armitage and Hughes, 2017).   
12 Must Boi encouraged young people to examine violence in their lives and speak out against it.  The campaign specifically 
targeted mainly urban middle -class youth aged 18 -25, and consciously aimed to work more with  young men  
13 The three apps are: Krousar Koumrou (animated features and a sharable quiz which aims to change negative attitudes 
and be an educational tool to increase knowledge to end domestic violence); Safe Agent 008 (a personal network 
notification app for users to be able to discreetly and quickly contact up to 10 trusted family and friends if they feel 
unsafe); and 7 Plus (to help food and service sector workers feel confident and able to claim their rights to be free from 
harassment and violence in th e workplace)  10 
 rural areas of Amhara region, where the Ye gna marketing director noted that “Ambo reaches 
everywhere in the country and this creates an opportunity for us to connect to the inner society that 
we could not reach only through radio and television … Partnering with Ambo means that we can 
leverage the ir extensive distribution network to increase awareness of Yegna and drive more 
listeners to the show.”14  In Brazil, Promundo partnered with SSL International to design a new 
brand of Durex condom that spoke for and to young people. Promundo’s ‘peer educat ors’ - young 
men recruited from the community developed the ‘Hora H’ condom, which translates as “in the 
heat of the moment” after young men reported hearing their peers saying “Everyone knows you 
shouldn’t hit your girlfriend, but in the heat of the momen t you lose control” (Ruxton, 2004).  
• Evidence suggests that programmes that partner with local organisations and build 
capacity are the most sustainable. For example, in Nepal, the VOICES project combined an 
innovative Samajhdari (Mutual Understanding)  radio programme with a comprehensive community 
outreach initiative that provided legal literacy training, formed listener and dialogue groups and 
trained women leaders as ‘community reporters’ and community leaders. Local radio stations and 
organisations also benefitted from enhanced professionalism on talking about violence against 
women. An impact assessment of the programme noted that the sustainability of radio/digital 
technology is improved by 'offline' activities such as outreach and training in communiti es: 
“Although the program has now ended, these organisations and media reporters will continue to 
play a crucial role in reporting and preventing violence”  (Equal Access, 2010: 44)

Instrumentalising the digital: adolescents ’engagement with ICTs
in low- and middle-income countries
Shakuntala Banaji, Sonia Livingstone, Anulekha Nandi and Mariya Stoilova
ABSTRACT
In development agendas regarding children in low-income communities,
both older and emerging media are typically ignored or assumed to
have beneficial powers that will redress social and gender inequality.
This article builds on a recent rapid evidence review on adolescents ’
digital media use and development interventions in low- and middle-
income countries to examine the contexts of children and adolescents ’
access to, and uses of, information and communication technology(ICT).Noting that only a handful of studies heed the significance of social
class and gender as major axes of inequality for adolescents, the article
scrutinises the gap between the rhetoric of ICT-based empowermentand the realities of ICT-based practice. It calls for a radical rethinking of
childhood and development in light of the actual experiences, struggles,
and contexts.

Introduction
The communication strategies which accompanied modernisation interventions in the field of devel-
opment from the 1940s onwards were top-down, decontextualised, and technologically determinist.
One of the assumptions on which they were premised was that dissemination of information alonecan lead to substantial change and, more specifically, that technical innovation can radically trans-
form remote rural communities in developing nations by pulling them towards Western, urbanised
modernity, and comparable economic prosperity (Manyozo 2012 ). When large-scale, expensive
development interventions consistently failed to provide these intended results, instead exacer-
bating economic and social inequalities in their target areas, the premise and foundation of their
design and implementation were questioned (Escobar 2011 ; Friere 1978 ; Melkote and Steeves
2001 ). While some critiques of modernisation rationales and practices for using mass media such
as television have gained purchase among media and development practitioners, resulting in theemergence of more participatory approaches (Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda 2014 ), many of the
assumptions of the modernisation paradigm persist.
In relation to children and young people, expectations regarding the promise of ICTs are often at
their highest, building on the hugely appealing rhetoric of the “digital native ”(Banaji 2011 ; Brown
and Czerniewicz 2010 ). Many policymakers and practitioners hope that the proliferation of ICTs
and digital media in developing countries can expand the participatory potential of communicationfor development (C4D) programming. But others argue that the rhetoric around ICTs has provided anew and alluring guise for technocentric modernisation thinking in development (Mazzarella 2010 )
and is becoming ever more entrenched as the notion of a “digital imaginary ”(Third and Collin 2016 )
gains purchase. Given this contested context, this article addresses two overarching questions:
(1) What does the available evidence reveal about adolescents ’access, use, and everyday contact
with media and digital technologies in low- and middle-income countries, including about devel-
opment programmes ’use of digital media to target adolescents?
(2) Does the available evidence also indicate how problematic practices and modernising assump-
tions of development projects using digital media with adolescents in low- and middle-incomecountries could be addressed and transformed?
These questions concern the intersections among several domains of knowledge –ICTs and digital
media, and adolescence (both domains heavily led by research in the Global North), and C4D and
ICT4D programmatic interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Each is contested,
even with regard to terminology. In this article, we identify the central terms, debates, and findingsthat have shaped these fields in the past decade, and examine the gaps between what is known
about adolescents ’everyday media/digital usage in LMIC contexts and the messy realities of devel-
opment interventions using ICTs with adolescents.
To answer our research questions, we draw on a rapid evidence review of the literature on ado-
lescence, media use, ICTs, and C4D interventions in a range of low- and middle-income countries (see
Livingstone et al. in press ) undertaken as a part of the Overseas Development Institute ’s longitudinal
research project Gender and Adolescence: Global Evidence (GAGE). We include material from sub-DEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 433Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), with some insights from
Latin America and East/South East Asia. The experience of undertaking this review in itselfbrought us face to face with intellectual and political tensions between the perspectives of scholars
and practitioners familiar, on the one hand, with international development discourses or, on the
other hand, with digital media and ICTs or, again, with childhood and adolescence.
Methodology
We searched databases for research published from 2006 to 2016. The original focus was on girlsaged 10– 14, but this was widened to include girls and boys aged 6 –18 when initial searching revealed
a paucity of research on young girls and ICTs. For reasons of quality control, priority was given to
research published in peer-reviewed journal but, recognising that much of the research in this
field derives from NGOs, government reports, and industry sources, we also included non-peerreviewed “grey literature ”and unpublished reports.
Our search terms were: (1) internet OR online OR digital OR “mobile phone ”OR app OR comput* OR
“cell phone ”OR ICT OR “social networking ”OR platform OR broadband OR connect* AND (2) child* OR
young OR youth OR teenage* OR adolescen* OR minor OR kid OR girl OR boy OR student AND (3)
“developing countr* ”OR “low and middle income countr* ”OR “low income countr* ”OR “middle
income countr* ”OR Africa OR Asia OR MENA OR “Middle East and North Africa ”OR“Middle East ”OR
“North Africa ”. These were tested on pre-identified databases, with the results limited to English and
to the period 2006 –16. This resulted in a total of 5,181 studies, which was supplemented by consulting
international experts (of whom 20 replied), as shown in Table 1 . The total of 5,181 studies represents the
cumulative total of hits on each database prior to the exclusion of duplicates. Some expert recommen-dations were also captured in the database searches. The overlap and duplicates between the expert
recommendations and database searches were removed. The 5,181 studies were then screened on thebasis of titles and abstracts to judge their relevance to the inclusion criteria about children, media, tech-
nologies, development and LMICs, which led to a streamlined batch of 481 studies. The majority of the
results that were excluded pertained entirely to adults or university students over the age of 18. This canbe explained by the different definitions of adolescence in different countries. Despite the filters and
the search terms, many results still pertained to countries in the Global North; some of these results
were retained where they provided useful insights on the digital media uses of adolescents from mar-ginalised populations in those countries, and could thereby provide an indication of access and uses
and practices of digital media of adolescents from underserved communities. The 481 studies were
screened down to 188 studies by reviewing the sections on methodology and study design of eachfull text article in order to check their compatibility with the inclusion criteria.
We included a few studies from high-income countries (HICs) on the grounds that they captured
transnational phenomena or relevant conditions for digital media use in LMICs. We read and codedfull texts of these 188 studies according to: type of study; type of data; design of evaluative studies;
geographical distribution; and income classifications (as applied by DFID UK). We coded each study
thematically in terms of a focus on digital access, skills and practices, opportunities, online risks andmediation (by parents, educators, and peers). Finally, we selected the 62 studies employing robust

template that identified the research questions, place/geographical location, method (includingsample and age group), claims/findings, study evaluation, and a critical and discursive comment
on epistemology, framing of ICTs, and adolescence. We complemented the resulting insights with
selected case studies of ICT-related programme interventions targeted at the capability developmentof children in LMICs.
We note, in reflecting on this process, that it was disappointing to find so little empirical research on
children and adolescents ’experiences of ICTs in LMICs, given the optimistic hyperbole in many inter-
national policy statements regarding their being supposedly at the forefront of adoption and creative
appropriation. It was also disappointing to find ourselves documenting –as below –the limitations in
conception, design, and quality of the available research far more often than we could celebrate inspir-
ing studies or programmes with insightful implications for future research and good practice. Despite
the wealth of sophisticated literature on children in education studies and childhood studies (see
Ennew 2003 ;K a t z 2004 ;S e n 2014 ), we suspect this situation reflects the relative invisibility of children ’s
experiences for development researchers and policymakers, it being easier to impose adult-centric
assumptions than to engage seriously with children themselves. It may also reflect the sense,
endemic in the study of ICTs in development, that technology and, indeed, children ’s uses of it, is chan-
ging too fast for in-depth investigation or, especially, longer-term evaluation of interventions. Last, it
was often the case that, although a study was included in our review for its relevance to ICTs, for
the researchers or practitioners involved, the ICTs were often black-boxed as merely a convenientand up-to-date means of distributing resources, so that the specific relation between children ’s litera-
cies-in-context and the affordances of the ICTs deployed would go unnoticed.
Unseen children: messy realities beyond the official statistics
Given that children (up to 18 years old) comprise one third of the population in “less developed ”
countries (UN 2015 ), it is surprising –but indicative of children ’s low status –that neither the Inter-
national Telecommunications Union nor any other source (e.g. UNICEF) is able to document children ’s
internet access in terms of official statistics for more than a handful of countries. Best available esti-mates suggest that children are also around one third of the world ’s internet users (Livingstone, Carr,
and Byrne 2015 ), going online roughly in the same proportion as adults (albeit fewer when very
young and up to twice as much as adults when adolescent (ITU 2013 )). This makes it impossible to
break down the category of “children ”in terms of gender, age, household income, or any other
factor, although for adults (often misleadingly described as “individuals ”or“the population ”)
plenty of sources document persistent forms of inequality within as well as between countries(e.g. GSMA 2016a ; ITU 2016 ; World Bank 2016 ). It is also, of course, difficult to break down the cat-
egory of ICTs using official statistics –ICTs take different forms, including online, networked,
mobile and also more established media (radio, television, film, press, and so on, all of which areincreasingly accessible via online platforms); “online ”itself includes diverse internet services includ-
ing information, gaming, social media, streaming, and other services.
But even if the statistics were available, qualitative research reveals the many reasons why bald
percentages should be scrutinised, qualified, and contextualised. It charts the manifold ways in
which access and use depend on resolving a host of challenges associated with electricity, connec-
tivity, cost, digital skills, social acceptability, spatial privacy, and adult permission at the communityand individual levels, as well as with commercial viability, investment, and government regulation
at the level of the state or region (Chigona, Kamkwenda, and Manjoo 2008 ; Hilbert 2010 ). For
many children, access is absent, limited, sporadic, or otherwise problematic, and it varies by age,
gender, socio-economic status, caste, and other important sources of inequality (Banaji 2015 ,2017 ;
Bosch 2008 ).
For example, in their sizeable multi-method study of 9- to 18-year-olds ’mobile phone use in
Ghana, Malawi, and South Africa, Porter et al. ( 2012 ) found that mobile phone ownership/usageDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 435varies according to the income level of each country, with Malawi scoring the lowest, followed by
Ghana, then South Africa. There is the same pattern across locations in each country, with theremote rural being the lowest. Distinctively, certainly by comparison with children ’s experiences in
much of the Global North:
“many young people across Africa obtain work and live off resources provided by social contacts: kin and friend-
ship networks are crucial in this respect …This requires careful nurturing of social relationships over time and
mobile phone contact is extremely valuable. ”(Porter et al. 2012 , 149)
Porter et al. ’sﬁndings caution against the assumption of a linear progression between the spread of
ICTs and mobile devices across the globe and access as optimistically assumed in industry and policyreports (e.g. GSMA 2016a ,2016b ). They demand recognition of the crucial distinction –ever less
meaningful in the Global North –between access and use. In their research, most young people
did not own personal phones and so had to ask for or borrow them, most commonly from afamily member, with phone ownership sometimes facilitated as a gift from urban-based family
members. But such phone ownership can be transient, since young people ’s phones are also sold
to obtain daily essentials when in need. Moreover, borrowing is inﬂ ected by family status (e.g.
foster status), household resources and livelihood patterns, and intergenerational relationships. Forexample, restrictions on borrowing are widely reported in Ghana and Malawi (Porter et al. 2012 )
and also in India (Banaji 2017 ).
Even when access is feasible, care should be taken in presuming use. In their small-scale compari-
son of two cases with South African youth –one with low-income older urban teens, and one with
younger boys (11 –13) from an affluent suburb –Walton and Pallitt ( 2012 ) provide a nuanced sense of
digital media in everyday life. For the poorer adolescents, it emerged that poverty constrains mediause in key ways. One boy listened to his neighbour ’s music through the wall, and he rationed daily
game playing to 15 minutes to save his phone battery (as he pays to charge it). It seems, too, that he
only used some phone functions, again, to save money. Another boy used such an old phone that his
peers ridiculed him, so he tried to use it in ways that his friends wouldn ’t notice (e.g. on silent/vibrate)
to avoid being shamed. Furthermore, the boys in this study selected their games because they were
free or very cheap, and they were ingenious in locating free/cheap downloads and in avoiding com-
mercial tactics to “steal ”their prepaid airtime. The older teenage girls, too, had developed strategies
to manage their stringent lack of resources –for instance, deleting their games to make phone space
for messages from boyfriends (saved to cherish intimate memories). Between the older boys and
girls, a local instant messenger app permitted playful and flirtatious interactions, offering a way toshow off by competing to collect contacts. Walton and Pallitt observe that “gaming is a popular
local appropriation of mobile phones …Unlike expensive console games, they do not require specialised
hardware or negotiations with other household members ”(2012 , 353). Significantly, this led them to
explore how “game literacy ”permits young people to articulate and re-appropriate their lived experi-
ences of gender, class, and ethnicity with energy and creativity (although the consequence is thereproduction of existing inequalities –for example, boys using gaming to reassert the value of mascu-
line subcultures and the exclusion of girls from this).
Good intentions backfire: struggles to deploy ICT to overcome inequality
Particularly problematic, as amply illustrated in our corpus of research studies, are those policy andprogrammatic interventions which focus on access alone as the “solution ”to inequality without due
attention to context and consequences, intended and unintended. For example, Hansen et al. ( 2012 )
examined whether provision of a laptop for educational purposes enabled the cognitive develop-ment of 10- to 15-year-olds in Ethiopia, comparing them after six months of use to children
without such provision. Perhaps surprisingly, “there were no systematic increases in student perform-
ance due to laptop use ”(993). But this overall finding was, on more detailed examination, qualified
by finding that use of laptops did benefit the performance of students –on measures of abstract436 S. BANAJI ET AL.reasoning –in higher grades but not in lower ones, possibly because the older children used the
laptops more, and for more activities. In other words, providing access without attention to pre-exist-
ing skills and social contexts can result in exacerbating rather than ameliorating inequality.
While this problem is known in ICT4D circles, the troubling case of One Laptop per Child being
the most telling instance (James 2010), recent literature remains replete with studies that see-
mingly discover anew that merely providing access is unlikely to deliver intended goals; quite
the contrary. A benign interpretation suggests tha t this reflects insufficient knowledge-sharing
among the different expert fields that infor m intervention programmes, the dual myths of
potent new technologies and digitally savvy children holding sway for many even when evidencecontradicts them. A less benign interpretation points to the political and economic interests behind
interventions, focused on the highly visible and newsworthy distribution of expensive and shiny
technologies while under-investing in much-ne eded accompanying programmes for literacy and
training and, saliently, failing to consult the views of the supposed beneficiaries, especially whenthese are “merely ”children.
Sometimes it simply seems beyond the scope of a study to examine why a well-intended interven-
tion fails. For instance, consider Pfeiffer et al. ’s(2014 , 183) puzzlement when providing 15- to 19-year-
olds in urban Tanzania with health information. They found that even though the adolescents weremedia-savvy:
“almost none of [them] made use of sexual and reproductive health information on the sites targeted at youth.
Instead, they went into search engines such as Google, where they entered keywords and screened the websites
that came up. ”
A similar instance is Nwalo and Anasi ’s(2012 , 93) study of adolescent girls ’access to, and use of,
reproductive health information in Nigeria: they found that “interpersonal means of communication
and mass media were the sources through which the respondents accessed reproductive health infor-
mation ”, notwithstanding the availability of more reliable, in-depth, and con ﬁdential information
online. While these studies presumed that digitally savvy young people would bene ﬁt if resources
were simply provided, for Gouws ( 2014 ), Banaji ( 2011 ), and Brown and Czerniewicz ( 2010 ), the
digital native discourse has more pernicious consequences in compounding existing inequalities
by directing learning resources uncritically towards those who are already at home in digital environ-
ments even though they are often already privileged. This is not to argue against the importance and
value of support for digital resources and skills, but rather to urge attention to empirical research on
how such resources and skills are distributed unequally and, then, to ask critical questions aboutwhich should be fostered, with whom, and to further which (or whose) goals.
To counter the problematic emphasis on access alone, Larghi et al. ( 2015 ) frame their study of
Argentinian teenagers in terms of the digital divide, distinguishing the first-order digital divide (inaccess to hardware and connectivity as a function of age, gender, and social class), the second-
order digital divide (in digital media appropriation within families and the development of digital
skills and literacies), and the third-order digital divide (in terms of actual practices of use and,thereby, the benefits that might accrue). In the Global North, attention to the first-order divide is
fading as access becomes taken for granted, although the importance of the second and third-
order divides remains important. In the Global South, all three are important, demanding distinctbut interrelated research on access, social contexts, and consequences of use.
But addressing such challenges demands nuanced and contextualised research. For instance,
Lemphane and Prinsloo ’s(2014 , 738) ethnographic comparison of the digital literacy practices of
8- to 14-year-olds living in wealthy (white) and poor (black, “slum ”) households outside Cape
Town, South Africa acknowledged the ways in which these resources have become part of a rhetoricof progress and modernity in order to grasp how and why provision of digital tools entrenched ratherthan overcame social and economic inequalities:
“digital media [were] at least partially complicit in a ‘widening of the gap ’to the extent that the differential uses
and availability of resources across social classes produce different imaginings of self, social ambitions andDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 437investments, and differing ways with social semiotics. Such differences translate into and contribute to the main-
tenance of social inequalities in school settings that coincide with language and social class divides. ”
In short, in the context of South Africa, where English is the language of a privileged white elite,
merely going online was implicated in reinforcing hierarchies of power:
“While the [privileged] Bolton children are learning to think of themselves as legitimate participants in local,
online, globally connected middle-class English language-based culture, the [poor] Mahlale children are acquiring
linguistic resources that are localised, indexical of their sub-elite status and not associated with success in school-
ing.”(Lemphane and Prinsloo 2014 , 750)
Lemphane and Prinsloo ( 2014 ) are critical of calls for digital out-of-school interventions that use
mobile phones or multiplayer games but pay little attention to the way in which limited access
and unsympathetic surroundings (lack of food, time, parents with little interest in digital media)
can frame and alter poor, non-white children ’s experiences of pleasure and learning online. As one
of the few studies designed to examine these differences in qualitative and comparative ways, Lem-
phane and Prinsloo ’s work suggests a template for other future studies in different locales. In other
words, if insights from wealthy homes are to be applied in less privileged contexts, considerable cri-ticality and adaptation will be vital.
Countering “adultism ”: the importance of child-centred, contextualised, and
participatory approaches
InGirls Speak Out , based on a “fast-talk ”process with 33 girls aged 12 –18 from 13 countries in Asia,
West Africa, and Latin America across a mix of rural and urban locations, de Pauw ( 2011 ; see also
Raftree and Bachan 2013 ) found that, on the one hand, the girls faced substantial problems (including
teen pregnancy, child labour, health risks, poor sanitation, and sexual violence), but they nonethelesshave “big dreams for their future careers ”and “see education as the foundation for their success in life ”.
Asked specifically about ICTs, they were eloquent about both the difficulties of access (adding new
insights on, for instance, how domestic chores took up all their time, and how boys edged them away
from the computers in school, while cyber-cafés could be a site of sexual harassment) and also theopportunities they hope for. They talked about valuing ICT to research issues they care about, includ-
ing their rights, community development, physical and mental health information, economic oppor-
tunities, news, gaining job skills, or finding work. They wanted to share experiences, discuss problemsor use ICTs for activities related to awareness-raising, campaigning, civic engagement, and student
mobilisation.
Girls ’proposed solutions to increasing their access to ICT are also noteworthy –they highlighted
the need to address gender-based inequalities, injustice and stereotypes, both in general and inrelation to technology. They thought it would be necessary to educate parents, teachers, and com-
munities on the importance of girls ’access to digital media, as well as to make access to ICTs better.
Girls were also interested in ICTs being better integrated in the curriculum, having technology
content and curricula in their own languages, and in more opportunities for peer-to-peer learning.
Yet, in our rapid evidence review, we found few studies exploring these topics or seeking ways toempower girls in the ways they themselves wish for.
A good example of an initiative seeking to empower adolescents to discuss the issues that concern
them while informing local governance policies is UNICEF ’s mobile-based platform U-Report. This text
messaging communication platform was launched in Uganda in 2011 (Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda
2014 ) as a local initiative allowing young people to contribute ideas to governance and decision-
making processes that impact on their local communities. Users have an average age of 24 and
those who sign up share opinions on topics ranging from job skills to disaster management
(UNICEF 2015 ), and respond to questions sent out by UNICEF staff twice a week. These are then aggre-
gated and shared with media and policymakers. Since its inception, U-Report has spread to several
other countries and has reportedly reached a million active users (UNICEF 2015 ). Although in some438 S. BANAJI ET AL.countries the platform is also used by policymakers, crucially for our argument, evidence that young
people ’s voices expressed on the platform have any impact on or response from policymakers is slim
in the evaluations, and children are not included either in evaluation or policy-making.
In another case, the Kenya-based non-profit organisation AkiraChix partnered with large develop-
ment organisations and the corporate sector to address the under-representation of women and girlsin ICT-related fields. Its programmes target girls of different ages and backgrounds and include kids ’
camps, week-long intensive boot camp training sessions for high school girls, and a year-long trainingin programming, design, and entrepreneurship for young women from under-privileged back-grounds, followed by placements in different tech organisations at the end of the programme.
Since 2010, 61 young women trained by AkiraChix have gone on to get internships, jobs, or to
start their own businesses (AkiraChix n.d.). The programmes raise the capabilities of these young
women, equip them with employability skills, open up opportunities of a possible career in ICTs,
and bring them into contact with highly skilled women ICT mentors, all of which are in themselves
huge opportunities. However, the intensive effort required to reach this relatively small number ofgirls over several years makes such an initiative difficult to sustain or implement at scale.
Other challenges and criticisms also exist. One is that the widespread fascination with digital tech-
nologies risks that the focus and analysis becomes media-centric, losing sight of the bigger picture ofthe contexts and meanings of children ’s lives within which digital media may or may not find their
place and contribute constructively (or otherwise). This problem seems particularly evident in thefield of health and information seeking, where the convenience and confidentiality of digitalmedia is particularly appealing to practitioners. There is little doubt that adolescents want such infor-
mation –Global Kids Online found that around a fifth of 12- to 14-year-olds and 43% of 15- to 17-year-
olds in South Africa looked for health information online at least every week (Byrne et al. 2016 ). But
initiatives often promote narrow adult-defined forms of information rather than responding to ado-lescents ’interests, or they provide generic access to the internet with little check on the types of
information gleaned in terms of accuracy or relevance. No wonder they chart less-than-hoped for
success, while their target audience sought the required information from peers, parents, or the
more-familiar mass media (Livingstone et al. in press ). Relatedly, and keen to benefit from the fact
that adolescents ’access to digital media is growing significantly in many low- and middle-income
contexts, Mitchell et al. recommend not an either/or approach but, rather, that “education programs
delivered face-to-face, such as in school or religious settings could be enhanced with SMS reminders and
additional information about program content ”(2011 , 778).
An example of a programme designed for flexible delivery is the World Starts with Me (WSWM), a
computer-based interactive sex education programme developed in 2002 –03 for secondary school
students (aged 12– 19) in Uganda, and implemented in over 150 schools since (Rijsdijk 2013 ). It
aims to promote sexual and reproductive health by educating young people to make independent
decisions about sexual practice. The programme supports the efforts of Ugandan educators to inte-
grate ICTs into the school curriculum. Evaluation of the WSWM programme involved a quasi-exper-imental design, including pre- and post-test, intervention and comparison groups, and was
conducted using a school-based self-administered questionnaire. Outcomes varied based on the
way the WSWM programme was implemented at each school, but overall, students from the inter-vention group who had considerable exposure to the programme (completed at least the first 10
out of 14 lessons) had better outcomes on several indicators, including awareness of pregnancy pre-
vention methods, intention to delay sexual intercourse and to use condoms, and self-efficacy indealing with sexual violence. Yet, the evaluation also found that the limited number of available
working computers, sporadic lack of electricity and insufficient teacher training were major
implementation problems faced by most of the schools.
In her ethnographic account of children in Western India, Banaji ( 2015 , 14) urges research, policy,
and practice to look “behind the hi-tech fetish ”. Only then, too, can one recognise how children use
and value (or not) ICTs in practice –for instance, seeing that “knowledge and skills in apps, games,
scams, jokes and memes constitutes one evident facet of media literacy ”(Banaji 2015 , 16). OtherDEVELOPMENT IN PRACTICE 439qualitative studies tell a similar story of creative re-appropriations in the face of high-pressure norma-
tive expectations from adults regarding children ’s ICT use. Pathak-Shelat and DeShano ( 2014 , 984)
explain how “Indian families in rural areas and small towns experience a clash of expectations
between how digital media technologies are promoted and how they are experienced ”(our emphasis).
Thus, while families explicitly associate digital media with work, educational opportunity andinformation:
“this perception seems to come from the media and other external sources, rather than directly from personal
experiences with new media technologies because when they talked about their own practices, playing
games on computers and cell phones was the most frequent response. ”(989 –990)
This is not entirely a matter of children ’s preferences: “digital technologies are marketed as youth-
oriented technologies giving ‘power ’to youth (youth agency), but we observed a web of school and par-
ental controls surrounding their use ”(992).
Other studies critique the tendency to underestimate children ’s capabilities to negotiate and navi-
gate digital environments. For instance, systematic formal educational initiatives to teach younger
children about the complex risks and opportunities in digital environments in low-income commu-nities of the Global South are few and far between, and significantly hampered by norms governing
the discussion of sexuality, pornography, and other sexual content with children. Further, focusing on
young people living in marginalised contexts in South America, Europe, and Australia, Snyder andPrinsloo ( 2007 ) argue that subtle cultural disjunctures between school, home, and community
often mean that knowledge and experiences about ICTs, health, or sexuality gained in one site donot transfer or are not recognised and valued in another. Yet Cook et al. ( 2012 ) challenge the wide-
spread tendency to infantilise children as incapable of understanding the risks involved, their study
showing that not only are some children aware of the risks, but they deal with them on a daily basis.
Conclusion
ICTs are often intended and even assumed to act as an enabler or facilitator of equity and partici-
pation: but often they do not. Given the paucity of evidence about adolescents ’digital media uses
between and among regions in LMICs, international development policy informing programmes tar-
geting adolescent capability development need to be critical and cautious in how ICTs are harnessed
to promote child rights. While ICT4D interventions have some limited successes (e.g. ITU 2011 ; Sachs
et al. 2015 ), their engagement with issues pertaining to adolescent capability development and child
rights is particularly wanting. Our review suggests a problematic divergence between what adult sta-keholders expect children (particularly those from low-income areas) to do with digital media andwith what they actually do, as well as between development interventions’ assumptions about the
potential and the realities of many children ’s access to, skills with, and interest in ICT-related interven-
tions. Too often, interventions have tended to focus on the supply side while ignoring dynamics thatstructure demand and use and, therefore, condition practices; they thereby risk perpetuating hierar-
chies of gender- and age-related power.
In this article we have tried to highlight promising studies of interventions, respecting the good
intentions of many of those working to improve children ’s lives through the use of ICTs. However,
few if any cases show evidence of long-lasting social change, even though it is crucial that development
interventions are sustained beyond the rudimentary achievement of programme objectives in order tolearn the significance of ICTs for adolescents ’capability development, especially their potential to con-
tribute towards social justice by expanding the equity, participation, and agency of young people indetermining their futures. Most worryingly, some fear that through the fascination with ICTs:
“the global corporate players (through new gadgets, schemes, and advertisement), as well as the government,
through rhetoric and development schemes, are raising normative expectations to be part of global markets
that are impossible to meet in their rural location with infrastructural limitations. ”(Pathak-Shelat and DeShano
2014 , 998, emphasis added)440 S. BANAJI ET AL.In one study, 15- to 19-year-old students in urban Brazil concluded that they had grown up “under the
inﬂuence of the Internet and under the logic of cultural consumption associated with it ”(Ferraretto et al.
2011 , 393). This logic was barely addressed in the literature reviewed, and yet ICTs are usually proprie-
tary, leaving programme providers dependent on the terms of service of the ICT provider (cost, data
security, user privacy, commercial exploitation of data, etc.). Further, ICTs are regulated by statebodies either directly or through corporate franchises, and quite often in a restrictive manner involving
censorship, and can be used as tools for surveillance (Chattopadhyay 2011 ;G o m e z 2004 ). It is therefore
important to ask critical questions in the face of growing enthusiasm for the use of ICTs within program-
matic interventions in LMICs (Banaji 2015 ,2017 ; Kleine, Hollow, and Poveda 2014 ).
We have shown how maximising the positive potential of ICTs requires a grounded understanding
of how technology interacts with social, political, and economic factors important for development(Banaji 2017 ; World Bank 2016 ). While this conclusion is already established in the field of ICT4D, it
seems that each generation of researchers, policymakers, and practitioners must rediscover suchfindings if they –and we –are to sustain a critical lens on the much-hyped and yet reasonably
hoped-for prospects for new forms of online learning and information, for the exposure or protection
of children from online risks, and in relation to children ’s rights to participate in community, leisure,
civic, and political realms (Livingstone and Bulger 2014 ). Such efforts must include attention to the
lifeworld and its pre-existing inequalities also to find participatory strategies to recognise the particu-lar meanings and practices that shape the lives and concerns of the children who are, after all, the
intended beneficiaries. Given the continued innovation and adoption of ICTs and digital mediaacross LMICs, it is no longer possible to conceive of development without ICTs. At the same time,
the role of ICTs needs to be critically assessed, rather than assumed, and evaluated alongside the
non-digital development opportunities relevant to children and their life contexts.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching 
in the developing countries of Palestine, Libya, and Afghanistan, as reported by middle-school 
students, their parents, and teachers. These countries have been struggling with an unstable and 
violent situation for decades. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 60 participants from 
the three countries and 60 online classes were observed. Findings revealed that COVID-19 
widened the digital gap among students and families , which created challenges in terms of online 
class attendance. In addition, violation of students’ and parents’ digital privacy emerged as another 
key challenge to emergency remote teaching. However, teacher presence and timely feedback in 
synchronous online sessions strengthened students’ engagement within the emergency remote 
teaching environment. Overall, emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 crisis deepened 
inequities across students and infringed upon the digital ethics of students, teachers, and parents.   Keywords: COVID-19, Coronavirus, digital inequity, digital privacy

Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) is an unplanned and sudden shift from traditional in-
person education to remote teaching, using technology to deliver teaching and learning materials 
and activities, due to natural disasters, economic crises, violence, and p andemics. In the past, 
individual countries have used technology to teach online for a limited time in response to crises 
and school shutdowns (Czerniewicz et al., 2019; Holzweiss et al., 2020; Khlaif & Salha, 2020; 
Shraim & Khlaif, 2010; Traxler et al., 2019). This year, ERT was implemented in countries across 
the world to fight the outbreak of Coronavirus (Johnson et al. , 2020; Khlaif et al., 2020). ERT is 
unlike normal online learning: while typical online courses take 3–6 months to design, develop, 
and deliver to students, ERT materials or lectures were originally designed for face-to-face 
delivery, and their quality in the remote context can be low (Khlaif & Salha, 2020). In developing 
countries in particular, students may also struggle with the digital equity and accessibility of 
educational resources delivered in the context of a crisis (Czerniewicz et al., 2019; Jones & 
Bridges, 2016; Khlaif et al., 2020).  
In this study, we investigate the challenges associated with emergency remote teaching in 
the developing countries of Palestine, Libya and Afghanistan, as reported by middle-school 
students, their parents, and teachers. In the introductory sections below, we first describe our 
conceptual framework, which is centered in digital inequity and digital privacy. Next, we describe 
the context of the three countries under study and lay out our key research questions.  
 Conceptual Framework 
The dimensions and determinants of the impact of COVID-19 on educational systems 
within developing countries are wide and varied. In the context of digital learning, however, two 
issues may represent key challenges to students and their families in developing c ountries: digital 
inequity and digital privacy.  Below, we review these two issues in more detail, with particular 
reference to the three developing countries  under study. 
Digital Inequity 
Digital equity is conceptualized in the framework of resource distribution, technical 
knowledge and skills, and the impact of  Information and Communication Technology  (ICT) use 
(Yuen et al., 2018). Willems  et al.  (2019) defined digital equity as access to hardware and software 
and connectivity to the internet to create, share, and exchange high-quality content in a suitable 
language. Resta et al. (2018) suggested that there are five dimensions of digital equity: hardware , 
software and connectivity to the internet, high-quality digital content in local languages, creation 
and sharing of digital content, educators who know technology, and high-quality research and 
application. 
In recent years, with the increasing use of ICT in education, digital inequity has begun to 
receive more attention from researchers  (Kurea, 2015; Yuen et al., 2016). With the shift to remote 
learning during the COVID-19 crisis, digital inequity has become an even more critical topic (Hall 
et al., 2020; Khlaif et al., 2020). For example, a recent U.S. study reported that school closures due 
to the spread of COVID-19 prevented children with disabilities from continuing their learning. 
These children were from the poorest families who did not have access to technology  (Collis & 
Vegas, 2020).  
In developing counties, the digital divide may be even more stark. Shraim and Khlaif 
(2010) highlighted that a key challenge of implementing e-learning in the Palestinian educational The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 271  system was students’ differential access to devices and high-speed internet. A significant aspect of 
the digital divide in developing countries is the difference between men ’s and women’s access to 
and use of technology (Mariscal et al., 2019; Singh, 2017). For example, Elaiess (2017) found a 
gender divide in Libya, with women and girls having less access to technology, such as the internet, 
compared with men because of cultural and social issues. Internet cafes for only men are not 
accepted.. The digital gap in gender is more evident for countries in the global south (such as the 
three countries under study) than for countries in the global north (such as the U.S.). 
Digital Privacy 
Digital privacy refers to the protection of an individual ’s information and communication 
that is used or created while using the internet on a computer or personal device (Robertson  et al., 
2019). It is worth noting that the protection of digital privacy requires the knowledge, the technical 
practices of online security, institutional privacy procedures , and the skill to conduct several 
processes for protecting online data (Li, 2018). Digital privacy is often understood as  an individual 
right that must be respected and secured even when people have different objectives and desires 
(Ahmed & Booth, 2016). With advancements in technology, individuals can communicate and 
leverage data more easily , but are also at increased risk of hackers violating their privacy and data      
confidentiality (Lustgarten et al., 2020). 
Despite the importance of digital privacy, students are often unaware of its meaning or 
value. For example, Lorenz et al. (2012) conducted a survey of sixty-one participants from Estonia, 
which examined the relationship  between students’ awareness of privacy and their level of 
participation in the online learning environment. The findings of the study revealed that students 
in the online learning environment did not distinguish between educational social interaction and 
their privacy. The researchers considered student lack of awareness to be a threat to the student ’s 
privacy (Lorenz et al., 2012). Similarly, Siemens et al. (2013) conducted research on Canadian 
students in a master’s degree program to explore their perceptions of privacy and its impact on 
their engagement within an e-learning environment. The findings of the study revealed that 
students are not aware of their privacy in the online forums.  
Students may be unaware of digital privacy issues because they have not been formally 
taught about them. Kumar et al. (2019) conducted nine focus group sessions with 25 teachers in 
elementary school settings across three regions in the north of the U .S. to ascertain the meaning of 
digital privacy and security. The findings of their study revealed that teachers rarely teach their 
students about digital privacy and security while using technology . However, teachers and parents 
themselves may have little understanding about digital privacy. Citizens’ concerns and behaviors 
in terms of digital privacy may also be influenced by political and cultural factors. For example, 
Fahey and Hino (2020) point out that during the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries (such as 
France, South Korea, Iran, and Qatar) have taken a “data first” approach to contact tracing and 
other public health measures, while other countries (such as Germany, Italy, Japan, and the U.S.) 
have taken a “privacy first” approach.  
Studies of digital privacy have not focused on developing countries. However, a unique set 
of political and cultural factors impact education in developing countries. For example, in 
Afghanistan, the education system has long struggled with issues revolving around  culture, lack 
of security, and distance; these challenges continue today (Arooje & Burridge, 2020; Rasmussen 
& Kelly , 2016). Many of these challenges are further affected by transparency and quality The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 272  assurance. Thus, levels of awareness and concern about digital privacy in education could be quite 
different from those found in prior studies. 
Context of the Three Countries Under Study 
The three developing counties under study are Palestine, Libya, and Afghanistan. All three 
countries have been struggling with unstable situations and continuous violence for decades, and 
thus have implemented ERT many times before the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the three 
countries are quite distinct, all three share a similar security situation, have experience in education 
under crisis, used online learning before the COVID-19 pandemic, transformed education into 
ERT during the COVID-19 pandemic, and have the technological initiatives to integrate 
technology into teaching and learning. Below, we provide context regarding the educational 
system of each country. 
Libya 
Education policy in Libya is managed from the top down and is influenced by the overall 
political system of the country. The education system has changed frequently since the Arab Spring 
in 2011 (Aloreibi & Carey, 2017). The World Bank (2013) reported significant success in 
enhancing the literacy rate in Libya by increasing the budget for education and making it free and 
accessible for all Libyans and implementing new programs to improve education. Conversely, 
Gadour (2011) argued that the Libyan educational system is still not capable of producing 
graduates with the necessary skills to compete in a world where knowledge and technology are 
essential for development in different aspects of the society. Hbaci et al. (2020) found that Libyan 
educators believe that using technology is still a difficult task, and that schools need computers, 
internet access, training, and financial support to improve the teachers ’ technological competencies 
in teaching and learning. Libyan students may also be underrepresented in terms of their 
participation in global learning platforms: a recent study of Arab users of  the MITx online learning 
platform found that only 111 per million Libyans used the platform, compared to 1,552 per million 
in the United Arab Emirates and 383 per million in Egypt ( Ruipérez-Valiente et al., 2020). 
Palestine 
As an occupied territory, Palestine is subject to a variety of ongoing restrictions (such as 
checkpoints and other travel restrictions), as well as periodic “security spikes” characterized by 
unrest, violence, and travel lockdowns, which negatively impact its educational system. For 
example, students and teachers may be unable to pass through checkpoints in order to reach school 
in time, or school trips may be canceled due to travel restrictions (Traxler et al., 2019). A recent 
study conducted by Bruck et al. (2019) confirmed the continued conflict in Palestine decreased the 
probability to pass the final exam, and the opportunities to get an admission from the university to 
pursue higher education. To mitigate the negative impact of restriction of mobility o n their 
students’ education, many Palestinian teachers have turned to digital technologies (Traxler et al., 
2019). Furthermore, the Ministry of Education (hereafter MoE), which is responsible for the 
administration and development of the Palestinian education system at the levels of preschool, 
basic education, and secondary education  has taken different procedures on the ground to reduce 
the negative impact of conflict on educati on such as locating teachers close to their living place 
and opening new schools in rural areas  (Shraim, 2018; Shraim & Khlaif, 2010). Moreover, the 
MoE has pursued a variety of initiatives to integrate technology in public schools, such as the 
Professional Development program (supported by the U.S. through USAID), the Belgium e-
Learning project (supported by the Kingdom of Belgium), and Smart Learning (supported by the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 273  local community in Palestine) (Khlaif & Farid, 2018). As a consequence, Palestinian education is 
highly digitized at both the managerial and instructional levels  (Khlaif et al., 2019). In general, the 
Palestinian education system is thought to be strong, with an adult literacy rate at more than 90% 
(Itmazi. 2020). 
Afghanistan  
The education system in Afghanistan is influenced by the Taliban, and therefore there were 
several changes in the Afghani education system from the Taliban period to the post-Taliban 
period (Dandawate & Dhanamjaya, 2019). The decades of conflict almost destroyed the education 
system in Afghanistan. During the Taliban era, most girls’ schools were closed; girls represented 
only about 6% of school enrollment, and women were barred from the few Teacher Training 
Colleges that remained open (Shayan, 2015). For students who did attend school, the curriculum 
included a religious subject that took up to 50% of the teaching time (Guistozzi, 2010). Starting in 
2002, girls’ enrollment began to rebuild; by 2013, girls represented 38% of school enrollment, and 
32% of teachers were women (Shayan, 2015). However, enrollment is inequitably distributed 
across the country; in 2008, 80% of girls attended school in the Hazara region, while only 10% did 
so in several southern provinces (Larson, 2008). 
Noorajan (2020) described Afghani online learning as very poor, stating that access to  the 
internet and digital learning resources are still not available in most educational institutions. The 
digital divide is greater than expected because  of the digital inequity to access to technology and 
the social gap among the Afghani society  (Khan et al., 2012). Saay and Norta (2018) claimed that 
higher education institutions have moved forward in terms of creating a shared, reliable, high -
speed, interoperable e-learning structure, a similar system for K -12 is not yet a reality. 
Contribution of this Study 
Although much research has been conducted on distance education, there is a lack of 
research on ERT in developing countries, particularly since the COVID-19 emergency forced 
schools to close and transfer their education to online classes. This study examines a “hidden 
shadow” on education across these three countries: the unrevealed impact of ERT during the 
COVID-19 pandemic on education, including on students, parents, teachers, and quality of content. 
The study aims to answer the following questions: 
• How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school settings  by 
instructors in these three countries? 
• To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and their families?  
• To what extent did digital privacy concerns create chall enges for students and their 
families?  
 
Methods 
A qualitative approach was adopted for the current study. The qualitative approach is 
generally used to describe an intervention or phenomenon in the real -life context in which it 
occurred (Yin, 2003). The qualitative approach used in the current study w as individual semi-
structured interviews and observations of online learning sessions.

Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 274  Participants 
The participants in the study were parents, students, and teachers in middle school settings 
in Libya, Palestine, and Afghanistan. Sixty participants (20 participants from each country , 
including 15 teachers, 15 parents, and 30 students) were interviewed to discuss their lived 
experience with ERT in middle school settings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, 60 
online classes (4 for each participating teacher) were observed.  
Purposeful sampling was used to recruit participants. The criteria for recruiting the 
participants in the study were having experience in online teaching during the COVID-19 
pandemic; living in Libya, Palestine, and Afghanistan; and allowing the online classes to be 
observed. The participants were recruited through the professional network of the first author, who 
was working with nonprofit organizations to train teachers on the use of ICT tools in education in 
these countries. Table 1 presents demographic information about t he participants.

Data Collection  
Semi -structured interviews with 60 participants on Zoom were the main data source of this 
research. Individual interviews were 20–30 minutes in length and were audio-recorded after 
obtaining permission from each participant. The interviews with participants from Libya and 
Palestine were in the Arabic language. The interviews with participants from Afghanistan were in 
the Dari and Arabic languages.  
The secondary data collection approach was observations of online classes. Researchers 
observed four online classes for each teacher. The main criterion for teachers to participate in the 
study was allowing their different online classes  to be observed. The researchers observed 60 
online classes from the three countries , which took around 50 hours. Forty online classes were in 
the Arabic language and 20 were in the Dari language (the Afghani official language). The classes 
comprised students from different backgrounds and cultures. All the students, parents, and teachers 
participated in the study on a voluntary basis.   
Data Analysis 
The data analysis process started with the manual transcription of the interview audio files. 
The transcribed files in the Dari language were translated into the Arabic language to facilitate the The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 275  data analysis process. The researchers individually coded the data into themes and subthemes from 
all the data sources by using thematic analysis  (Creswell & Creswell, 2017). Through thematic 
analysis, researchers analyze, categorize , and report patterns in the data. After constructing the 
themes that emerged in the analysis of the interview data, the researchers used these themes to 
analyze the observations of online classes.  
In terms of the analysis of the observations of online classes , the researchers wrote notes 
on the structure of the classes  and audio-recordings of the sessions to answer the first research 
question. Furthermore, the data from the observations of online classes were used to support 
themes and subthemes that emerged in the individual interviews.  
Trustworthiness 
After transcribing the interviews, the researchers sent all the written transcripts to 
participants for checking, asking them to  verify the content for accuracy. Moreover, participants 
were asked to write notes, rewrite content, and add new information on the transcripts. 
Participants’ transcripts were not altered by the researchers. When the final themes had been 
constructed, a professor in educational technology was asked to select  a small portion of the 
transcription and analyze it based on the constructed themes to check the accuracy of the themes. 
In the Results section below, transcript excerpts are labeled according to the participant ’s role 
(Parent, Teacher, or Student), country (A = Afghanistan, L = Libya, or P = Palestine) and a 
personal identification number. 
 
Results 
Research question #1: How was Emergency Remote Teaching implemented in middle school 
settings by instructors in these three countries? 
Based on the analysis of the observations of online classes, the researchers categorized the 
implementation of ERT by schools and teachers in the three countries in to three themes: type of 
online learning classes, students ’ engagement, and the design and delivery of online instruction.  
Type of Online Learning Classes 
Most of the teachers in the three countries used both synchronous and asynchronous tools 
to deliver instruction to the learners in the middle school settings. Typically, teachers created their 
asynchronous class using Edmodo or Google Classroom, and posted links to synchronous Zoom 
sessions on the class wall. Most of these teachers also recorded the synchronous sessions and 
posted the recordings for students who may have missed class. Students needed to log into the 
virtual classes to access the recorded sessions. All the teachers used free versions of the Zoom 
application, Google Classroom, and Edmodo. 
However, some teachers used other asynchronous platforms to deliver instruction and to 
communicate with their students, and they rarely used synchronous sessions. A follow-up question 
was sent to these teachers about the reasons for not using synchronous session s. Typically, teachers 
responded that most of their students did not have access to the internet because of the electricity 
in Gaza in Palestine and in Afghanistan being cut off.  
Despite differences in the type of online instruction among the teachers from the three 
countries, all teachers’ instruction shared the following common features: it was free, it was easy The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 276  to use, students had to enroll in the platform to access content, and technology tools were 
integrated.  
Types of Content Delivered  
Various types of content were used by teachers to instruct students, including interactive 
activities designed in open-source platforms, educational videos from YouTube, PowerPoint slides 
designed by teachers and students, pictures, infographic s, and whiteboard animation. Teachers 
from Palestine and Afghanistan focus ed on using simple technological tools to design and deliver 
the instruction, most of which were from open-source platforms. They integrated simple tools to 
design and deliver interactive content to the students. However, the Libyan teachers depended only 
on one tool to design and develop instruction, which was the Edmodo platform.  
Few teachers assigned online tasks or activities to their students in the synchronous 
sessions, as they reported they did not want to distract students in the online sessions . Instead, they 
assigned activities asynchronously using Edmodo or Google Classroom.  
In synchronous online sessions, teachers shared their screens, used different features of the 
online platform such as the whiteboard and polls, and used breakout rooms to allow students to 
work on assignments in small groups. Depending on the type of instruction, teachers allowed 
students to share their screen.  
Students’ Interaction 
Teachers tried to support students’ engagement and interaction with each other in the 
synchronous and asynchronous sessions by designing and delivering activities. A few teachers 
gave students the opportunity to interact with the instructor or with their peers. These teachers 
delivered online individual and group activities. Teachers asked students to work on these 
activities online by forming groups and giving them the option to share their screens to present 
their work to their peers. Other students were able to interact with their peers by providing text 
and verbal comments by using chat and audio features.  
Many of the students engaged and interacted with their teachers thr ough text questions 
written on the chat tab. In addition, some students engaged in answering their peers ’ questions on 
the chat tab.  
Some female students from the three countries were reluctant to participate verbally in the 
online discussion. However, we noticed that these students were active in the asynchronous 
discussion on the platform.  The researchers asked the female students a follow-up question about 
their engagement with the platform and discussions. Feedback from participants indicated that 
students had various reasons for choosing to participate in asynchronous rather than synchronous 
interaction, including personal reasons and cultural and religious reasons. (We discuss these 
reasons in more detail under Research Question 3.)   
Moreover, the researchers noticed that the presence of teachers on the platform and timely 
feedback encouraged students to complete their assignments and interact with their peers. Students 
from Afghanistan were more engaged in asynchronous activities than Palestinian st udents. 
Observations suggested that the reason for this was that unlike the Afghani teachers, Palestinian 
teachers did not interact with their students in asynchronous platform s. Libyan students engaged 
and interacted in both synchronous and asynchronous platforms less than the Afghani and 
Palestinian students.  The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 277  Challenges of ERT  
All the participants from the three countries reported that ERT was a big challenge for them 
since it was unplanned, and students, teachers and parents were unprepared to shift to online 
learning. Most of the teachers in the three countries agreed that “this was not the first time we 
moved to online teaching during a crisis” (Teacher P2) and that previous transformation had been 
for “specific schools in specific districts due to violence” (Teacher A4). Implementing ERT on a 
large scale in the three countries caused pressure and anxiety for families in these countries. A 
parent from Afghanistan said: “Using online learning during the COVID-19 crisis put me and my 
wife under pressure. We have three kids in school… We do not have enough devices and enough 
knowledge about online teaching” (Parent A1). 
Research question #2: To what extent did digital inequity create challenges for students and 
their families? 
All the participants from the three countries reported that m oving to ERT suddenly 
increased the digital gap in the learning process. In addition, they all reported that digital inequity 
put them under high pressure and caused anxiety—particularly since they did not know when this 
state of emergency would end and allow them to return to face-to-face learning. Overall, the 
researchers identified three main themes: inequity in internet and hardware, quality of digital 
content, and inequity based on gender.  
Inequity in Internet  and Hardware 
Internet Broadband Connectivity 
Teachers from Libya, Afghanistan, and Palestine noted the weakness of internet bandwidth 
as an element that hindered their ability to provide timely instruction to students , ultimately 
affecting student engagement.  Although teachers in all three countries mentioned the issue, it was 
reported less in the Palestinian context than in the      Afghani and Libyan contexts. Teachers and 
students who referred to the inequity in internet reported that access to internet broadband was one 
of the major barriers to implementing ERT during the COVID -19 pandemic.  
For example, a teacher from Afghanistan reported that “[the] internet nowadays is weak 
because a lot of people were trying to attend online classes … It cannot help me prepare instruction 
and deliver it to my students” (Teacher A3). Researchers observed that students from rural areas 
in all three countries were at more of a disadvantage in terms of the availability and reliability of 
the internet than their peers from large cities. 
I live in a small village north of Gaza, Palestine. I did not attend online classes… I missed 
most of them because the electricity is cut off all the time… Even if we have electricity, 
the internet is weak. I asked my relative who lives in Gaza city to send me the recorded 
files to view them when electricity is available (Student P3).  
A female student from a rural area in Afghanistan stated: “I usually go to my uncle’s house 
to attend online classes because we do not have the internet at home” (Student A3).  
The participants from Libya reported that families’ financial situations influenced their 
connectivity to the internet.  
I am a teacher in Tripoli. I have not received my salary for the last year, so how can I pay 
for the internet? My priority is to pay for food and living expenses… Moving to emergency 
remote teaching was sudden, and it is difficult to adopt it in a short time (Parent L3).  The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 278  Inequit y in Hardware 
Families from all three countries reported that some households have too few technological 
devices based on the number of children enrolled in schools and universities , especially in families 
in which the father or mother or both are enrolled in a graduate program at a univ ersity. A female 
student from Libya reported, “I cannot attend synchronous classes because my sister is using the 
device [laptop] when it is time for the class” (Student L2). A female student from Palestine stated 
that “before this crisis [COVID-19], I used to use my mom’s iPhone to finish my assignments, but 
now I cannot do this because she uses it to teach her students ” (Student P4). 
A parent from Libya reported:  
Because of the stay at home rule, I lost my job, and it is difficult to buy a new device for 
my kids to attend online learning. I asked their teacher to provide me the recorded teaching 
materials to use them by my children (Parent L3).  
A male student from Afghanistan stated: “I have two sisters, one in high school and the 
older one at the university. All of us are using the same desktop… My dad cannot buy an additional 
computer for us” (Student A9). A parent from Palestine said, “I cannot buy more devices because 
I have not received my salary in the last six months because of Coronavirus” (Parent P3).  
Quality of Digital Content 
Parents, teachers, and students agreed that the quality of digital content delivered by 
teachers in both synchronous and asynchronous sessions was low. For example, Libyan parents 
and students mentioned the low quality of course content for math and English, while Palestinian 
and Afghani students and parents reported the low quality of learning materials and content in 
science. Teachers believed the low quality of course content was a result of the sudden transition 
to remote learning contexts.  
We moved to online teaching within 24 hours . I do not have time to plan and design suitable 
content for my students… The teaching online is completely different from teaching face  
to face… It needs specific teaching strategies, specific content , which takes a lot of time to 
prepare (Teacher A3). 
Other teachers from Libya and Palestine reported that they were “unprepared” to design interactive 
content, stating that they “do not have a team to design” and “do not know the tools to use in the 
design process” (Teacher L1, Teacher L3, Teacher L4; Teacher P4, Teacher P5).  
Students from Afghanistan complained about the quality of the assignments and the 
grading system.  
The content is related to the lesson in the book, but when I went to do the assignment, it 
was unclear. I do not feel there was a connection between the assignment and the material. 
In addition, I do not know how my teacher will grade me (Student A4).  
Some parents from Palestine and Afghanistan were struggling to teach and assist their 
children because they do not have experience with the design of digital content. A Palestinian 
parent said, “I usually teach my children and help them finish their tasks and activities but now I 
do not know how to start with them… I asked my brother, who is a teac her, to help them” (Parent 
P2). A parent from Afghanistan stated: “I am not educated in using technology . It is difficult for 
me to teach my kids this type of content” (Parent A5). The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 279  Inequity Based on Gender 
Most students and parents, and some teachers, believed that online course design and 
delivery was biased based on gender. For example, female students reported that course materials 
and activities tended to focus on males by showing photos of boys or using boys’ names.  
Our observational data supported female students ’ perceptions that teachers from all three 
countries privileged male students by using gendered language, referring mostly to boy s’ names, 
allowing male students to speak more frequently, and often interrupting female students . 
My teachers are biased toward males in online classes. Since the beginning of teaching 
online two months ago, I have only been allowed to use the mic twice for two or three 
minutes, but some males talk more than all the females (Student P4) . 
A female student from Libya said: “In the presentation of our project, my teacher did not 
give us an opportunity to present in the same way as males and in mixed teams . He asked if I prefer 
males to present the project… I like to discuss my ideas, but I am not allowed to” (Student L3).  
The inequity based on gender was not only due to teachers, as some families did not allow 
their female children to use the microphone. A female student from Libya stated: “My dad put 
restrictions on using the microphone and camera while using his laptop for online learning” 
(Student L5). A Palestinian female student mentioned that her mo ther allowed her to use the 
internet for learning without opening the mic and the camera (Student P2).  
Research question #3: To what extent did digital privacy concerns create challenges for 
students and their families?  
According to the data analysis, a new theme related to the ERT during the COVID-19 crisis 
was mentioned by the participants , which was digital privacy. Most of the participants in the 
current study stated that teaching and learning in the ERT environment should be managed 
professionally and ethically by teachers and students.  
All participants expressed concerns about digital privacy , and most of the students reported that 
their digital privacy was violated by on e of their family members or by their teachers. Furthermore, 
families stated that sharing devices such as smartphones, laptops, or desktops is considered as 
violating individual privacy. In general, perspectives on privacy seemed re lated to two key themes: 
gender differences in privacy and sharing devices or internet access.  
Gender Differences in Privacy  
As mentioned earlier, many female students mentioned that their families did not allow 
them to use their camera or microphone during class. A follow-up question was sent to the students 
asking why their families were concerned about the camera and microphone. Below, we draw from 
these responses as well as students’ original interviews.  
Due to security concerns, cultural traditions, or rel igious strictures, many female students  
and their families  felt their personal images should remain private. For example, one parent said, 
“We are living in a bad situation because of violence and security. I am concerned about her 
[daughter] privacy in online learning. I do not know how to protect her” (Parent A3). In some 
districts in Afghanistan, Libya, and Palestine, it is considered inappropriate for families to allow 
their children to share photos , videos, or even to appear talking in a video clip . Other families from 
these countries consider themselves open-minded and allow their children to share videos and The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 280  photos and use a webcam on the internet; however, these families were a minority. Overall, many 
female students felt their privacy was threatened by teachers as well as other students.  
First, some teachers asked female students to engage in practices that the students or 
families felt were inappropriate. For example , the researchers noticed that some male teachers 
asked students to open their camera at the beginning of the session. Some of the girls refused to 
open it, with one girl saying, “I do not like to open my camera for personal reasons ” (Student P1), 
and the teacher respected their privacy. During the online sessions, some teachers asked students 
to share their desktop; some students agreed to share it while others refused to share it, with one 
saying, “I have personal pictures in the background on my computer ” (Student A2). In interviews, 
a few other female students reported that their teachers asked them to open the webcam, which 
they considered a violation of their digital privacy  and reported to their families . One student 
asked, “Personal information on social media and in the online classes  is private information. I do 
not like to use the camera, so why did my teacher asked me to open the camera? ” (Student L4). 
Other families did not allow their girls to attend online classes if they were asked to share their 
information on social media or share their laptop screen. 
Second, female students felt that many of their male peers did not know the “boundaries” 
or work “professionally” (Student A5) in the new online learning environment. A female student 
from Afghanistan expressed anger about some of her male friends who looked for her social media 
profile and sent her a friend request.      Some female teachers from Libya and Afghanistan also 
reported that many girls complained about the bad conduct of their peers, which included taking 
screen shots of the online sessions and posting them on social media pages, trying to add them as 
friends on social media, and sharing their emails on the chat tab in the online sessions to contact 
them.  
In contrast, most of the male students did not care about their privacy. They were willing 
to open their camera and to share their desktop and shared no concerns about these practices in 
their interviews.  
Sharing Devices or Internet  
Parents from all three countries reported they were forced to share their own smartphones, 
laptops, or desktops with their children for schooling purposes, which they felt was a violation of 
individual privacy. A parent from Palestine sta ted:  
Because we do not have extra devices, somet imes I share my smartphone with my son and 
allow him to use it… My accounts on social media are open,  and I share my thoughts with 
my close friends… Allowing a family member to share my device puts my digital privacy 
at risk (Parent P3).  
A Libyan parent reported that she does not like to share her laptop with her children. She 
said, “I am lawyer, and all of my clients’ files are stored on my computer… Honestly, when I let 
my kids use my laptop, I observed them” (Parent L4). We asked her a follow-up question about 
restricting access to her files by using a password. The answer was: “I do not have high skills in 
computers to protect myself… I would appreciate it if you could help me” (Parent L4). A woman 
from Afghanistan reported that her husband asked her if he could share her smartphone in his 
online session. “My husband is a science teacher and he asked if he could use my phone… At the 
beginning, I hesitated because I have my sister ’s wedding pictures on it” (Parent A3).  The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries 
Online Learning Journal – Volume 25 Issue 1 – March 2021                    5 281  In addition to sharing devices, many families shared their internet access points with 
neighbors. This practice was common in Palestine and Afghanistan but was less common in Libya 
since buying an internet package is cheaper than in Palestine and Afghanistan. “No, I do not like 
to share internet with others. It is cheap… I have high internet speed for less than $10” (Parent 
L1). 
When families shared internet with neighbors, parents worried that their children could be 
stalk ed by others on their network. A parent from Afghanistan reported: “We share internet with 
one of our neighbors because it is expensive to buy an internet package alone… My daughter told 
me that our neighbors’ son knows everything about her online account and sen t her a friend 
request” (Parent A1). Students from Libya and Palestine reported that they do not feel safe and 
secure in the online environment when they share internet with their neighbors. For example, a 
female student from Palestine said : “When I post anything on social media, our neighbors ’ son 
was the first to like or comment. I feel he is waiting for me to write a post” (Student P8).  
 
Discussion 
The aim of the study was to explore the challenges of ERT during the COVID-19 crisis in 
three developing countries , Libya, Palestine, and Afghanistan. A qualitative approach was adopted 
to achieve this aim. Moving suddenly from face-to-face teaching to ERT complicated and 
disrupted the educational system in these countries , which had already been affected by violence 
and unstable policy, as well as the weaknesses of the infrastructure and the bad economic situation. 
Although teachers tried their best to foster students ’ engagement in online learning sessions , they 
sometimes failed because of the digital inequity among students and families.  
Teachers and students in the developing countries used synchronous and asynchronous free 
tools to continue teaching and learning in the ERT, and teachers on both asynchronous and 
synchronous platforms provided support and encouraged students to engag e in online activities . 
Teachers relied on their own technology solutions because there was no well-designed and secure 
online system or platform for teaching and learning . As a result, learners’ digital privacy was 
threatened, and consistent with previous studies, the quality of content in the emergency context 
was low compared with content delivered in a well -planned online learning context (Hodges et al., 
2020; Khlaif et al., 2020; Mohmmed et al., 2020;Whittle et al. (2020).  
Our results found a number of inequities between students. Some parents could not provide 
their children with technological devices and families in rural and remote places encountered 
difficulties in getting connected to internet broadband, which reduced students’ engagement in 
online synchronous sessions compared with online asynchronous sessions.  Girls were also less 
active in synchronous online sessions than boys, due in large part to their hesitancy to share their 
personal images, but they were more active and productive in the asynchronous platforms. These 
results align with previous studies suggesting that digital inequity negatively influences the online 
learning process (Khidhir et al., 2020; Khlaif & Salha, 2020; Khlaif et al., 2020). 
We also found that digital privacy was a major concern for both parents and students. Most 
families were concerned about daughters opening their webcams or sharing their screens . Parents 
were reluctant to share their own devices for their children’s schooling, and worried that their 
children’s activities could be monitored by neighbors via shared internet access points. In general, The Hidden Shadow of Coronavirus on Education in Developing Countries

reduced students’ engagement in online classes. 
The concepts of digital inequity and digital ethics are still very limited, underrated , and 
unclear in developing countries such as Palestine, Afghanistan, and Libya. Both were eroded in 
the coronavirus ERT setting, which had a negative influence on students’ engagement in online 
classes. The absence of these concepts and related processes of instructional design among 
teachers in ERT settings  was obvious, which deepened digital inequity and damaged digital 
privacy. To address these issues, the Ministries of Education in these countries  may wish to 
consider three key actions. First, they could provide students and teachers with devices and reduce 
internet fees to make the internet available to a wide range of citizens . Second, they could develop 
a clear vision about digital privacy . Finally, develop a shared technology platform across the K -12 
system that will benefit learners and train teachers on it.

Prevention, disruption and deterrence of online child
sexual exploitation and abuse

Abstract European law has recognised the need for international cross-disciplinary
collaboration to both identify, locate and safeguard victims and prevent, investigate
and prosecute online child exploitation and abuse (OCSEA). However, there is evi-
dence that these crimes are continuing to increase and develop in step with techno-
logical advances. Changing the behaviour of both perpetrators and victims is both
challenging and expensive and there is little evidence of what works to reduce these
crimes. In this paper an argument is presented that changing the environments which
support OCSEA is necessary if we are to detect and manage these crimes, and more
importantly prevent them.

1 Introduction
In a report commissioned by the Council of Europe it was noted that Online Child
Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (OCSEA) does not respect national jurisdictions and
that there was a need for national and international cross-disciplinary collaboration
to identify, locate and safeguard victims and prevent, investigate and prosecute these
crimes.1It was also acknowledged that any such co-operation would require the abil-
ity to respond to technological change and the corresponding changes in offender
behaviour. Perhaps the most important international law instrument dedicated to the

rights of the child is the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)2with
Article 34 of the CRC requiring states to ‘protect the child from all forms of sexualexploitation and sexual abuse’. It also makes speciﬁc reference to preventing ‘the ex-ploitative use of children in pornographic performances and materials’. The OptionalProtocol to the CRC on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornog-raphy (OPSC) which followed covered many forms of sexual abuse and exploitationand speciﬁcally referred to child pornography.
3Article 2(c) of the OPSC deﬁnes
child pornography as ‘any representation, of whatever means, of a child engaged inreal or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts ofa child for primarily sexual purposes’ which provided a wider deﬁnition that other in-ternational instruments.
4Gillespie has argued that the region which has paid the most
attention to the issue of child exploitation and in particular child sexual abuse mate-
rials (CSAM) is Europe, with both the Council of Europe and the European Unionenacting international instruments that speciﬁcally relate to the issue of the sexualexploitation of a child, including through child pornography.
5
The Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Children against Sex-
ual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse CETS 201 (Lanzarote Convention) and the Con-vention on Cybercrime CETS 185 (Budapest Convention) provide comprehensivebenchmarks for both criminal law and procedural law standards to prevent and com-bat OCSEA.
6They build on the international standards set out by the UNRC and
the OPSC designed to protect children. Articles 18 to 29 of the Lanzarote Conven-tion and Article 9 of the Budapest Convention set out the substantive criminal lawand deﬁnitions of offences required to be transposed into national law. This conven-tion was the ﬁrst instrument to establish the various forms of child sexual abuse ascriminal offences including abuse committed in the home or family, with the use offorce, coercion or threats. The articles speciﬁcally relevant to OCSEA offences areArticles 20 to 23 of the Lanzarote Convention, which focus speciﬁcally in Article 20
on criminalising the production, distribution and possession of, and knowing access
to child pornography (increasingly referred to as CSAM
7), offences concerning the
participation of a child in pornographic performances (Article 21), the corruption ofchildren through intentional exposure to sexual activities (Article 22) and the solic-itation of children for sexual purposes (Article 23). In the European Union, Article6.2 of the Directive 2011/92/EU of the European Parliament and Council on Com-bating the Sexual Abuse and Sexual Exploitation of Children and Child Pornographyrequires EU Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that attemptsto solicit a child to provide CSAM are punishable. Article 23 of the Lanzarote Con-vention requires states to criminalise the intentional proposal of an adult to meeta child for the purpose of unlawful sexual activity. The 2015 Opinion of the Lan-zarote Committee on Article 23 of the Convention noted that “The solicitation of

children through information and communication technologies does not necessarily
result in a meeting in person. It may remain online and nonetheless cause serious
harm to the child. The sexual offences which are intentionally perpetrated during an
online meeting through communication technologies are often linked to the produc-
tion, possession and transmission of child pornography” (p6).8Of some importance
here is that the assumption of harm which underpins most legislation largely relatesto the production of CSAM
9and until recently there has been little research that has
explored the ‘additional harms’ that come through the possession and distribution of
this material.10,11,12,13
In a joint initiative by the EU and the United States, in 2012 54 countries from
around the world signed up to a Global Alliance against Child Sexual Abuse On-
line. They committed to key policy targets that aim at: a larger number of rescued
victims, more effective prosecution, and an overall reduction in the number of childsexual abuse images available online. The Global Alliance subsequently merged with
the UK’s WeProtect initiative to form the WeProtect Global Alliance to end child
sexual exploitation online, which brought together over 80 governments, 20 global
technology companies and 24 leading international and non-governmental organisa-
tions to protect children from sexual exploitation online. The Global Alliance (2016)
produced, ‘Preventing and Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (CSEA):
A Model National Response’ to provide guidelines and support on how to achievethe commitments. The Model was intended to enable a country to assess its current
response and identify gaps, prioritise national efforts to ﬁll gaps and enhance inter-
national understanding and cooperation. Its purpose is not prescriptive, but aims to
describe the capabilities needed for effective child protection, highlight good practice
from countries that are already delivering these capabilities, and signpost organisa-
tions that can provide further guidance and support to countries seeking to develop or
enhance their existing capability. This tool is an interesting development as it bringstogether, in an accessible format, international frameworks as well as the substantial
contributions made by organisations such as the United Nations, ECPAT and ICMEC.
2 Scale of the problem
In September 2019 the New York Times noted that in the previous year technol-
ogy companies reported to the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Chil-
dren (NCMEC) over 45 million photographs and videos of children being sexually
abused. This was more than twice the number reported in the previous year.14The

article made reference to research completed in 2019 in collaboration with NCMEC
which stated that “ ...online sharing platforms have accelerated the pace of CSAI
[child sexual abuse image] content creation and distribution to a breaking point whereNCMEC’s manual review capabilities and law enforcement investigations no longerscale” (p1).
15This study used anonymised metadata associated with the 23,494,983
NCMEC reports related to suspected CSAI that were received from March, 1998
(when NCMEC’s CyberTipline was created) until September 2017. NCMEC reports
come from the US public and many US ESPs (electronic service providers) and over9.6 million such reports (40%) occurred in the year 2017 (approximately one millionper month) compared to the 565 000 reports (2.4%) in its ﬁrst ten years of operation.
While meaningful estimates of these crimes are highly problematic,
16it has been
argued that there are essentially four ways in which online-facilitated child sexualabuse (OCSA) can be measured: by counting the number of offences committed, thenumber of perpetrators, the number of victims and the number of images that havebeen viewed, downloaded and exchanged. However, these authors note that quan-
tiﬁcation based on each of these four measures inevitably produces very different
ﬁgures, partly because they are attempting to count different aspects of OCSA. How-ever, there is converging evidence that sexual image-related crimes against childrenare increasing, although a recent meta-analysis of the prevalence of online solicitationamongst youth (one speciﬁc form of online child sexual abuse) would indicate thatone in nine young people experience online solicitation, although prevalence rateshave decreased over time.

3 Cybercrime
Online child sexual abuse (OCSA) can be positioned as a cybercrime in which tech-nology plays a role across a broad spectrum of activities. The deﬁnition of cybercrimehas been described as highly contentious, as while many people agree that cyber-crime exists, they are not really clear what it is.
18In this respect, cybercrime has
developed from earlier concepts of computer crime and e-crime and has broadened
to cover many different forms of criminal activity. The European Crime Prevention
Network19has also argued that there is a current absence of any consistent deﬁni-
tion, and even within speciﬁc legislative documents cybercrime is used in differentways. For example, the Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention uses broad crim-inalisation headings in its deﬁnition of cybercrime, including ‘offences against theconﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of computer data and systems,’ ‘computer-related offences’, ‘content-related offences’ and ‘copyright-related offences’.

Many researchers and practitioners21use ‘cyber-dependent crime’ and ‘cyber-
enabled crime’ or ‘cyber-assisted crime’ to classify different forms of cybercrime. Atone end of the cybercrime spectrum there is ‘cyber-assisted’ crime in which the Inter-
net is used in its organisation and implementation, but which would still take place if
the Internet was removed (e.g. a potential offender using online social media to locatea child who is sexually assaulted off-line). At the other end of the spectrum is ‘cyber-
dependent’ crime, which exists because of the Internet, such as DDoS (distributed
denial-of-service) attacks or spamming. Differentiating between cyber-assisted crimeand cyber-enabled crime is at times very difﬁcult, but it would appear that the bound-aries between cybercrime and traditional forms of crime have never been clear cut
and are becoming increasingly blurred due to the level of hyper-connectivity in to-
day’s highly digitised and networked world.
22The ubiquitous use of the Internet and
smart mobile devices in people’s everyday lives, the wide adoption of cloud-based
services by industry and government, and, for example, the advent of the Internet of
Things (IoT), the Internet of Everything (IoE), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs),have led to the widely accepted belief that almost all criminal activities include somecyber elements.
23As a consequence, digital forensics (sometimes called cyber foren-
sics) have become an essential part of almost all crime investigation processes for law
enforcement around the world.24
The United Nations Ofﬁce on Drugs and Crime25also argues that there is no
international deﬁnition of cybercrime or cyberattacks, but while they use the cyber-
enabled-cyber-dependent dichotomy, they add a further speciﬁc-crime type: online
child sexual exploitation and abuse, which includes abuse on the clear internet, dark-net forums and, increasingly, the exploitation of self-created imagery via extortion
- known as “sextortion”. Quayle expanded these crimes to include the production,
dissemination and possession of child sexual abuse images (known in many jurisdic-tions as child pornography); online grooming of children for sexual purposes; ‘sex-ting’; sexual extortion of children (‘sextortion’); revenge pornography; commercial
sexual exploitation of children; exploitation of children through online prostitution,
and live streaming of sexual abuse.
26Other authors have deﬁned OCSA as sexual
abuse of children involving force or enticement to take part in sexual activities where
the online environment is involved at any stage of the offence.27This includes the
production, preparation, consumption, sharing, dissemination or possession of childsexual abuse material and the solicitation of children for sexual purposes of children(sometimes called ‘grooming’), whether or not it results, or is intended to result, in
a contact offence. In high to middle income countries, technology now mediates al-
most all human activities in some ways, including those of children, which makes

an analysis of clear distinctions between ofﬂine and online abuse difﬁcult. Digital
technologies are embedded in our everyday practices and form an intrinsic part of
private and public experiences. Yet whilst creating opportunities for children to act asreceivers, participants and actors in the digital world, the Internet also creates spaces
of social interaction which hold the potential for exposure to online risks, including
sexual risks such as abuse and exploitation.
4 Cybercrime migration?
What is important to note, is that while there is converging evidence in some coun-
tries to support falling rates of non-technology-mediated child victimisation, includ-
ing child sexual abuse28,29,30,31this does not appear to be the case in relation to
some forms of OCSA. It is easy to speculate as to whether there is a relationship
between the decrease in ofﬂine CSA and an increase in OCSA, and whether there has
been a migration from one to the other. It is, however, much more difﬁcult to evi-
dence this. Probably the largest number of convictions for cyber sexual crimes relate
to possession of CSAM32and this may relate to the forensic evidence available for
law enforcement to secure a conviction.33Many, if not all, people charged with pos-
session will have a ‘permanent product’ of that crime available to law enforcement:pictures and videos depicting child abuse and exploitation that meet the criteria in that
jurisdiction for illegality. It might be argued that this (as opposed to the evidence re-
quired for prosecution of a contact offence against a child) will increase the number
of successful convictions. However, though not without its critics, the ‘cybercrime
hypothesis’ has been used to account for a reduction of crime in other areas.
34
Miró-Llinares and Moneva present two hypotheses which they argue highlight the
essential role of cyberspace as an environment that has shifted criminal opportunitiesfrom physical to virtual space and which ultimately reﬂects on crime trends.
35The
ﬁrst hypothesis provides evidence that the more time spent at home by many young
people engaging with, for example, video games and other online activities, could
have had an impact on the drop in juvenile crime. Their second hypothesis states,
which has relevance for this paper, that the appearance of cyberspace has led to ashift in opportunities from physical space to cyberspace. This seems particularly per-
tinent in relation to online grooming or sexual solicitation. For example, a survey of
law enforcement
36indicated that social networking sites (SNSs) were used to initiate

sexual relationships, to provide a means of communication between victim and of-
fender, to access information about the victim, to disseminate information or pictures
about the victim, and to get in touch with the victim’s friends; SNSs might be said to
‘afford’ opportunities for offending. In a similar way, what has been noted in offendersamples is the ease that online sexual behaviour can take place, often prompted bythe easy exchange of photographs, text or the presence of web cameras, without anyphysical contact, or the risks that would be associated with it.

5 Affordances
Positioning OCSEA as cybercrimes forces us to think about the context in whichthese abuses and exploitations take place. This potentially may offer ways of prevent-ing or managing these crimes and moves us away from a focus on the characteristicsof offenders or their victims (and how it may be possible to effect changes in their
behaviour). In the context of young people’s mental health and digital environments
it has been suggested that digital technologies have their own affordances, which arelisted as persistence, replicability, scalability and searchability.
38The affordances of
digital technology (in conjunction with the capabilities of online and networked tech-nology such as social media) allow digital information to be easily copied (replica-
bility), easily shared with large audiences (scalability), easily recorded and archived
(persistence), and easily accessed by others and found in the future (searchability).Livingstone argues that these affordances are:
“the result of complex networked infrastructures invented and implemented by
people working under huge pressure and at speed in, largely, commercial in-
stitutions with global ambitions. That means the needs of vulnerable young
people may come very low down in their list of priorities. How far researchers,clinicians and other practitioners can wrest back control to ensure digital net-works meet the best interests of young people is as yet unknown, though surelya struggle worth the effort”.
39
This has been explored in the context of ‘revenge porn’ (non-consensual inti-
mate image distribution) where it is argued that replicability and scalability haveincreased the ease with which such an act can be committed and the ease with whicha nude/sexual image can be distributed to a large audience.
40Persistence and search-
ability have also augmented impact of this act in some cases by allowing this content
to be located by others and to potentially affect a victim at some point in the future.
However, Dodge is critical of the decontextualised ways in which, for example the ju-diciary have universally used these digital affordances to justify harsh sentences andthis is further explored in a discussion of ‘affordances-in-practice’ which stresses the

40Dodge, A. [14].436 E. Quayle
idea that ‘affordances are not intrinsic properties that can be deﬁned outside their sit-
uated context of usage, but ongoing enactments by speciﬁc users that may vary acrossspace and time’ (p3653).
41
The term ‘affordance’ is used throughout this paper and this warrants further dis-
cussion. For Gibson, affordances referred to the possibilities that an object offers foraction, where the properties of the object emerge through the interaction betweenactors and those objects.
42This is not only related to the physical properties of the
object but also to social norms and rules.43The concept was further developed in re-
lation to human-computer interaction, where it was argued that an affordance shouldnot be understood as a property but rather as a relationship.
44It is therefore not a
static feature of an object and whether an affordance exists depends entirely on the
relationship between the actor and the property. Norman argued that the concept ofaffordances does not imply that online practices are determined by technology, butrather by how people use it. Therefore, affordances are not static features of tech-
nology, but have a number of potential actions associated with them. An affordance
exists once a user has perceived it and perceived the potential actions associated withit. For example, V oice over Internet Protocols (such as Skype) have not only beenused by many people to keep in touch with geographically distant family members
45
but also to facilitate the live streaming of sexual abuse of children. There are reportsof live streaming in South Asia with victims described as deprived children who arecoerced into live streaming of sexual abuse, from computers provided by employers,
against their will.
46However, live streaming has also been reported in high-income
countries such as the UK.47Live streaming provides real-time access to events for
participants who are not actually engaging in the activity themselves. The UK’s Na-tional Crime Agency’s strategic assessment of serious organised crime suggested that
“the practice of live streaming is one example of how offenders can simultaneously
create indecent images of children (IIOC) online, view IIOC, and commit contactabuse by proxy overseas”.
48A case study on Periscope (a live streaming platform)
provides a forensic examination of the technical and legal challenges for the investi-
gation of live streaming of sexual abuse.49This is a good illustration of how actors
may use technologies in creative and unpredictable ways.50

It has also been argued that the Internet creates affordances that facilitate innova-
tive ways of committing old and new crimes51and Jerde suggests child sexual abuse
material (CSAM) as an example of crime that uses Internet affordances to “circum-
vent law enforcement techniques deployed around national borders to avoid detec-
tion”52(p 2). A further study in the context of cyberbullying on social networking
sites (SNSs) used affordance to refer to the mutuality of actor intentions and tech-nology capabilities that provide the potential for a particular action.
53This relational
view of affordance is seen as advantageous for understanding technology use becauseit allows us to consider the symbiotic relationship between the capabilities of thetechnology and the actor’s goal and actions. It has been argued that the actualisation
of affordances occurs when an actor takes advantage of one or more affordances of
SNSs to achieve immediate concrete outcomes that support their goals. The focus istherefore on contextualised actions that technology makes qualitatively easier
54but
which may be speciﬁc to that relationality and which potentially move researchersaway from the certainties of separate technology attributes and actors’ attitudes.
55
6 Technological affordances and CSAM
Technological affordances have also been considered in the context of an interac-tion between design and usage and an example of this is privacy settings, whereaffordances shape practice in that privacy settings distinguish between public, pri-vate or partially private communications.
56However, as previously noted, users also
shape affordances, for example, young people setting up multiple proﬁles on SNSs toproject different selves to different audiences. Earlier work in this area suggested thatwe can also identify ‘social affordances’ that refer to interactions between how users
respond, the social context and social networks.
57However, it has been argued that
other people provide the richest and most signiﬁcant environmental affordances.58
One ﬁnding, of interest in relation to online grooming of children, is that technolog-ical affordances are related to the motivations people have for using them. It is notonly important to think about what these ‘action possibilities’ are, but when and forwhom they might happen. For adolescents this may relate to the developmental taskof exploring sexuality, afforded through the ability to create sexual media, the on-
line applications that support this (e.g. WhatsApp, Instagram), and the peer and adult
engagement with this digital content. Of importance, it has been noted that new tech-nologies reshape public life, but teens’ engagement also reconﬁgures the technologyitself. In the context of technology-mediated CSA, consideration of the reciprocity of

this engagement needs to be widened to include another set of actors - those moti-
vated by a sexual interest in children.
Crime opportunity theory59and the affordance perspective has been used to de-
velop a meta-framework to inform an understanding of SNS bullying.60Speciﬁcally,
crime opportunity theory argues that two primary components contribute to a crimebeing committed: a likely perpetrator, and environmental conditions that offer crim-inogenic opportunities. In this context using an affordance perspective into crime
opportunity theory helped explain how social media allows a perpetrator to evalu-
ate whether environmental conditions would facilitate SNS bullying activity. In theirempirical study they proposed two SNS environmental conditions that offered crim-inogenic opportunities for a likely offender to engage in SNS bullying. These were
the presence of suitable targets and the absence of capable guardianships. The af-
fordances that facilitated the identiﬁcation of suitable targets, and which have rele-vance for technology-mediated sexual abuse offences, were accessibility, informationretrieval, editability, and association. The ﬁrst two of these (accessibility and infor-
mation retrieval) are particularly salient for OCSA crimes. Accessibility affordance
allows a perpetrator to transcend time and spatial constraints to reach potential targetsand provides the opportunity to connect with an unlimited number of users, includingpeople who are known and also unknown, leading to an environment where suitable
targets can be identiﬁed and accessed. Information retrieval affordance refers to the
extent to which a user believes that an SNS offers the opportunity to obtain informa-tion about a user on that platform. This allows a likely offender to access materialcreated by a potential target, which provides information about the background, pref-
erences, and daily activities of that individual. These authors note that SNS updates
often include new features that encourage users to continuously create and share in-formation on these platforms.
Earlier work had also used these frameworks to understand CSAM-related
crimes.
61Their starting point was routine activity theory62which identiﬁed three
minimal elements for criminal action: i. a likely offender; ii. a suitable target, andiii. absence of a capable guardian. Focus on access to a suitable target, as with themeta-framework developed in relation to bullying, drew attention to the context in
which potential criminal activity takes place which can be modiﬁed or changed. This
moves the focus away from the ‘likely offender’ and the likely circumstances (bothdistal and proximal) that might have inﬂuenced their behaviour to the possibility ofchanging the environment in a way that increases or supplements the availability of
capable guardianship. It distinguishes between the inclination to offend and the ac-
tual offence. Analysing criminal activity, which is both particular and grounded inits situational context, should therefore relate to the context and circumstances of aparticular situation.
In the context of CSAM, the absence of a capable guardian seems particularly
pertinent. In November 2019 the BBC news reported (along with other agencies) the

decision by Facebook to encrypt all of its messenger services, ‘The end-to-end en-
cryption on Facebook-owned WhatsApp will be extended to Facebook Messenger
and Instagram, with Mr Zuckerberg [CEO Facebook] acknowledging there wouldbe a “trade-off” that would beneﬁt child sex abusers and other criminals’.
63While
there is limited evidence for the purposeful use of encryption by offenders to conceal
online sexual activities against minors,64tools such as WhatsApp, which have end
to end encryption, protect the data during transmission (and storage) by default.65
This also means that the applications used by organisations such as NCMEC and theInternet Watch Foundation (IWF) to detect and remove CSAM content (such as Pho-
toDNA) may no longer have the same efﬁcacy. PhotoDNA creates a unique digital
signature (“hash”) of an image which is then compared with hashes of other photos
to ﬁnd copies of the same image. When matched with a database containing hashesof previously identiﬁed illegal images, PhotoDNA helps detect, disrupt and report
the distribution of child exploitation material.
66Paradoxically, encryption by default
may provide an environment which perpetuates the sense of privacy and anonymity
associated with such applications. A recent study, albeit within a different context,
concluded that new app developers need to be mindful of the affordances of the prod-
ucts they develop,67and in terms of online child protection this may be crucial.
7 Criminogenic qualities of the Internet
Recently there have been a number of studies examining the criminogenic quali-ties of the Internet.
68,69It has been argued that situations vary in their criminogenic
qualities (producing or leading to crime), from those that challenge offenders by re-
quiring them to create opportunities, through those that provide easy temptations,
to those that actively provoke crime.70Importantly, Wortley considers the interaction
between criminogenic environments and the criminogenic disposition of the likely of-
fender. The latter has its roots in an offender typology which is based on the strength
of criminal dispositions and the different roles played in their crimes by the imme-
diate environment.71In this typology, anti-social predators may actively seek out
criminal opportunities and use situational information to make rational choices about
the risks and beneﬁts of committing an act. Mundane offenders engage in low-level
crime and seem to demonstrate poor self-control and succumb easily to the oppor-
tunities offered in a given situation. The ﬁnal category, provoked offenders, are less

likely to have a criminal record but react to an array of situational conditions, some
which may be internal and others environmental. Related to this, Seto described a
motivation-facilitation model of sex offending which examined the relationships be-
tween paraphilic traits (predispositions), state factors (which facilitate acting on thesepredispositions) and situational factors (access and presence of a capable guardian).
72
This was examined in the context of CSAM offenders and concluded that many of
these individuals are motivated to engage in sexual behaviour with children as they
have paedophilic or hebephilic sexual interests, but that they demonstrate high levelsof self-control (or low in facilitation factors). This leaves them less likely to commit acontact offence but this, in the context of access to Internet technologies, is not sufﬁ-
cient to inhibit acting on the opportunity to commit CSAM offences. These offenders
have also been found to have greater access to technology but less access to childrenthan contact offenders.
73
These issues are also examined in Brewer et al.’s study on adolescent delinquency
and the criminogenic features of digital technology.74These authors argue that the
Internet exhibits features that make it uniquely criminogenic to ofﬂine environments.The Internet as a distinct ‘place’ is said to de-territorialize encounters which are no
longer limited by geography and can take place in synchronous or asynchronous time,
which enable identity and motives to remain concealed. They suggest that, ‘Users caneasily move from a point of predictable use (e.g. targeted information searches) to ap-parently random and unpredictable discoveries of information, images and points of
view due to the multiple ‘hidden’ linkages between websites and services that are
often driven by commercial considerations” (p 118). Algorithms may also direct ornudge users to certain content or services based on past individual or collective activ-ity. It has been argued that these algorithms can be speciﬁcally designed to capitalize
on cravings and curiosities (and they may well have affordance qualities).
75
A topical example of this relates to YouTube’s video recommendation system
which displays on a sidebar what is ‘up next’ for the viewer.76These are ranked
according to the user’s history and context, and newer videos are generally prefer-
enced. A publication in the New York Times reported that YouTube’s algorithm was
encouraging people with a sexual interest in children to watch videos of partiallyclothed minors, often after viewing videos with sexual content. These videos wereoften domestic and showed children at the swimming pool or on vacation, but their
report claimed that there was evidence that for some of the people watching them they
were serving a different (and possibly sexual) purpose.
77A technical paper by three
Google employees discussed the deep neural networks for YouTube recommenda-tions and stated that a two-stage approach allows recommendations to be made from
a very large corpus (millions) of videos while still being certain that the small num-

ber of videos appearing on the device are personalized and engaging for the user.78
Our viewing history will determine what we are ‘nudged’ to view, and potentially
for a number of individuals will increase the likelihood of viewing content that may
approximate sexually inappropriate or illegal content.
It has been suggested that there are qualities of the Internet either in association
with facilitating conditions (personal or environmental) or otherwise that in them-selves made accessing and possession of CSAM more likely and in essence operate
as ‘event’ factors (that relate to the commission of this particular crime).
79This ar-
gument was framed within an analysis drawing on a situational crime control model,which emphasises the signiﬁcance of pre-criminal situations and opportunity. Tay-lor drew parallels between terrorist activities and CSAM-related crimes and arguesthat some forms of user interaction with the Internet suggest the Internet may have
criminogenic qualities.
80Firstly, the distributed nature of the Internet and the corre-
sponding lack of control over content is a factor in increased availability of illegal orundesirable material. Secondly, the way that distributed complex global microstruc-tures develop effectively increases opportunity for access to that content. Alongsidethis, criminal conspiracies can deliberately and intentionally use both content and
opportunity to engage with, and draw in, otherwise uncommitted people.
8 Practice implications for prevention
Changing individuals (likely offenders and likely targets) is both challenging and
expensive. Over the last 20 years there has been a development of a number of inter-net safety and education programmes to increase positive adolescent behaviour andsafety online but their ﬁndings from a systematic review of related studies suggested
that there is still a need for re-evaluating how internet safety education is delivered
in the future.
81In a further publication a content analysis of four Internet Safety Ed-
ucation Programmes for children indicated that most were not incorporating proveneducation strategies and lacked any strong evidence base
82although a more recent
study does advocate for the alignment of such programmes with a clearer evidence
base.83They also challenged whether messages would be better delivered through
broader youth safety prevention programs versus stand-alone lessons. Interventionprogrammes that target online offenders have shown equivocal evidence. For exam-ple, the UK-accredited treatment programme (iSOTP) was assessed following com-pletion of pre and post-psychometric assessments by 264 convicted offenders and in-
dicated improvements in socio-affective functioning and a decrease in pro-offending
attitudes.

Plus, developed in the UK by The Lucy Faithful Foundation suggested that data from
eleven groups indicated that participants felt enabled to face up to being arrestedand/or convicted, helped them develop a greater understanding of their offending be-
haviour and how to establish a non-offending life.
85However, an Impact evaluation
of the UK prison-based Core Sex Offender Treatment Programme between 2000 and2012 indicated that more treated sex offenders committed at least one child image
reoffence during the follow-up period when compared with the matched comparison
offenders who had received no treatment (4.4% compared with 2.9 %).
86
It seems likely that changing the contexts in which sexual crimes take place may
offer greater opportunity to effect change. Wortley (2012) comments that the most
common model of situation prevention is opportunity reduction, which involves ma-
nipulating the immediate environmental contingencies so as to increase the perceivedcosts of offending.
87He applies this to the problem of CSAM through an examina-
tion of three opportunity-reduction strategies: reducing perceived rewards, increas-
ing the perceived effort and increasing the perceived risks. Reducing the rewards ofCSAM may involve removing or denying access to content that is targeted by offend-ers through, for example, regulatory control of content by Internet Service Providers.
Disruption tactics, such as blocking efforts by Google and Microsoft, resulted in a
67% drop over 12 months in web-based searches for abuse images compared withno blocking activities from Yandex.
88There are some positive indicators in rela-
tion to Internet monitoring, moderation, and reporting of problematic content or be-
haviour.89One example is the development of a web crawler (Arachnid) by the Cana-
dian Centre for Child Protection to detect images and videos based on conﬁrmed dig-ital ﬁngerprints of illegal content and combat the proliferation of child sexual abuse
material on the Internet. They report that the automated crawler helps reduce the on-
line availability of child sexual abuse material through its identiﬁcation and issuingof a notice to the hosting provider requesting its removal. As of November 2019,over 13.3 million images were identiﬁed for analyst review and 4.7 million notices
were sent to providers. Of these, 85% of related to victims who are not known to
have been identiﬁed by police.
90Such disruption tactics reduce the number of im-
ages available through simple searching, which is important as the presence of easily
available CSAM, and high levels of Internet use, are risk factors in Internet offending.
Increasing the perceived effort of accessing CSAM involves making it more difﬁcultfor offenders to gain access to content, which means they have to expend more effort.A publication by the Mobile Alliance Against Child Sexual Abuse Content presents
a collation of approaches that have been proved successful in deterring or detecting
illegal or illicit use of mobile payment services used to access CSAM.

likely that increasing perceived risks may be achieved through proactive policing.
One example of this is provided by the EUROPOL initiative Police2Peer which in-volves law enforcement informing people trying to access or share CSAM on P2Pnetworks of the risks that they are taking and offering information as to where theycan get help.
In a similar vein, attention has been drawn to the particular context in which access
to CSAM occurs, which ﬁrmly locates the behaviour within the factors that inﬂuenceit. These have been summarized as: the signiﬁcance of high affordance cues givingaccess to images; immediate and highly salient reinforcement on achieving accessto images; perceived absence of capable guardianship and surveillance (in a generalsense as far as the Internet is concerned, and in a speciﬁc sense in terms of the privacyassociated with Internet use); insensitivity to immediate negative qualities resultingfrom both motivational factors and the strong affordance qualities of screen basedcues.
92Three kinds of crime prevention initiatives have been identiﬁed which may
be of value in helping to place this into context: primary prevention (focused on stop-ping a crime before it occurs); secondary prevention (directed at people thought tobe at high risk of committing an offence) and tertiary prevention (focused on knownoffenders).
93These categories were used to explore prevention efforts in relation to
CSAM using two additional crime prevention categories: reducing provocation and
removing excuses. Removing excuses (for example, through informing target audi-ences of the illegality of CSAM and its associated harms to children) through me-dia campaigns have provided evidence that these represent an effective way to reacha large audience and transmit the messages that there are signiﬁcant consequencesto viewing CSAM, individuals have personal responsibility in controlling their be-haviour, and that help is available. In this respect, campaigns appear to be an appro-priate strategy for deterring people from viewing CSAM, that sits alongside otherinitiatives.

While there is no evidence to suggest that online abuse and exploitation are moreserious or pervasive offences than crimes occurring ofﬂine, it is the case that theaffordances offered by online social media may present a signiﬁcant risk factor forsome children. Three factors play an important role in this complex and dynamicscenario: potential perpetrators and victims, the social context in which criminal ac-tivities take place and the rapidly changing medium. In this paper an argument hasbeen presented that changing the environments that supports OCSA is necessary ifwe are to detect and manage these crimes, and more importantly prevent them. In

2019 the Child Dignity Alliance produced a Technical Working Group Report which
examined the role of technology in combating the proliferation of online child sexualexploitation and abuse imagery. Critically, the report recommended that IT companies
such as Facebook, Google and Microsoft should continue to: support the efforts of
law-enforcement, government and non-proﬁt agencies through sharing key technicaland operational data; to share technology that tackles child sexual abuse imagery; toshare operational data about those abusing their networks; to improve the veriﬁcationof customer identity when new domains are registered or renewed, and to proactivelyidentify threat actors and vulnerable users. Such changes, along with the technical so-
lutions that ﬂow from them, offer the only scalable interventions in relation to these
crimes. Yet it is clear that prevention of OCSA is in its infancy and that, as argued byCarr, the response from the IT industry in increased proactive deployment and effec-tiveness of tools used to detect and deter CSAI is, while welcome, still partial withmany of the key organisations not fully engaged.
