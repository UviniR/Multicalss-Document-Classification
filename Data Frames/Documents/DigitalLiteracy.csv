INTRODUCTION
Information and communication 
technologies (ICT) particularly the mobile phone 
has immensely penetrated every field of life like education, business, commerce, and agriculture. Mobile phone-based communication has rapidly grown in the recent past and became the most used communication tool among all ICTs of the current age. Recent statistics showed that 62.9 percent of the population worldwide already own a mobile phone with 4.68 billion users on the planet (STATISTA, 2019). This trend is also similar in Pakistan as the country has seen an abrupt rise in mobile phone users from 88 million in 2008 to 152 million in 2018 (PTA, 2018). This rapid growth of Mobile telephony has emerged as a successful communication tool which has not only transformed the working style of many 1College of Humanities and Development Studies (COHD), China Agriculture University, No.17 Qing Hua Dong Lu, Haidian District, 100083,

ABSTRACT : Agriculture is considered as the main driving force in Pakistan’ s economy employing 45% of the country’ s labor force and 
generating 20% of national GDP Agriculture sector of Pakistan is facing numerous challenges including non-adoption of agricultural 
technology at the farm level, due to farmers’ lack of access to the latest information. In this context, the current study focusses on the use of 
the mobile phone in accessing agricultural information among the farmers of the  of district Muzaffargarh,Punjab, Pakistan. A multistage sampling technique was used to collect data from the two tehsils (cities/sub-districts) of Muzaffargarh formulating a total sample of 180 farmers. SPSS computer-based Software was used for analyzing the data. Results revealed that 91.2% of the farmers indicated mobile phone ownership. It was further reported that 87.20 % of the farmers used private sectors advisory staff to obtain agriculture information. Market information was ranked as the highest accessed information among the rest of farm-related use. Easy access to updated information and connectivity with stakeholders were reported as the highest perceived benefits of mobile phone use (4.63 & 4.72 mean). Findings reported that farmers’ limited aptitude of Mobile phone usage and lack of awareness of information sources as major constraints in farm-related use of the Mobile phone. On the basis of findings, the current study provided recommendations and policy implications for utilizing the true potential of these ICT-enabled solutions in agriculture.Key words: mobile phone, ICT, information transfer, e-extension, farmers, agriculture, Punjab, Pakistan.
RESUMO: A agricultura é considerada como a principal força motriz na economia do Paquistão, empregando 45% da força de trabalho 
do país e gerando 20% do PIB nacional. O setor agrícola dos paquistaneses enfrenta inúmeros desafios, incluindo a não-adaptação da tecnologia agrícola entre os agricultores, devido a falta de acesso dos agricultores às informações agrícolas mais recentes. Neste contexto, o estudo atual enfoca o papel do telefone celular na disseminação de informações agrícolas entre os agricultores do distrito Muzaffargarhof Punjab, Paquistão. Uma técnica de amostragem em múltiplos estágios foi usada para coletar dados dos dois tehsils (cidades / sub-distritos) de Muzaffargarh, formulando uma amostra total de 180 agricultores. O software baseado em computador SPSS foi usado para analisar os dados. Os resultados mostraram que 91,2% dos agricultores tinham propriedade de telefones celulares. Verificou-se ainda que 87,20% dos agricultores contatam o pessoal consultivo do setor privado para obter informações sobre a agricultura. As informações de mercado foram 
classificadas como as mais acessadas entre os demais usos relacionados à fazenda (média de 41,45). O acesso fácil a informações atualizadas 
e a conectividade com as partes interessadas são relatados como os maiores benefícios percebidos do uso de telefones celulares entre os 
agricultores com valores médios de 4,63. e 4,72,  respectivamente. Os resultados relataram que a capacidade limitada dos agricultores de usar o telefone celular e a falta de conhecimento das fontes de informação como principais restrições ao uso do telefone celular relacionado à fazenda. Com base nos resultados, recomenda-se a realização de sessões de treinamento com as comunidades agrícolas para criar conscientização e educá-las sobre o uso do telefone celular.Palavras-chave : Telemóvel, TIC, Transferência de informação, Extensão E, Agricultores, Agricultura, Punjab, Paquistão.

sectors but also created new professional dimensions 
in various businesses including agriculture (SULLIV AN & OMWANSA, 2013; ASONGU & ASONGU, 2018). In the agriculture sector, smooth exchange on information is a key to the successful adoption of farm innovation needed for the agricultural development but due to lack of resources and poor infrastructure in many developing countries, a huge communication asymmetry exists between the latest agricultural knowledge and farmers (BALOCH & THAPA, 2014).  In this scenario ICT, particularly the mobile phone has shown a great potential to facilitate communication by enabling the smooth exchange of knowledge between the various stakeholders in agriculture (AKER, 2011).
 In the agricultural context, the cellular 
phone has empowered the farmers to communicate from local to administrative levels regarding the agricultural trade, information exchange, and buying and selling inputs and farm commodities (OGUTU et al., 2014). This has reduced the cost of traveling and improved the production efficiency of farming communities living in remote areas. The mobile phone has tremendously been diffused even into the marginalized and underdeveloped farming communities because of its flexibility, affordability and user-friendly nature as compared to other ICT tools (OSABUTEY & JIN, 2016). Another dimension of mobile phone application in agriculture is “e-extension” that has simplified the mode of extension and advisory services by its effective role in communication between the farming communities and research organizations (AKER & KSOLL, 2016).
Generally, farm advisory services in many 
countries are delivered through conventional extension methods; e.g., farmers meeting, personal visits, mass discussions, etc. (FAOSTAT & PRODUCTION, 2016). But unfortunately, the current ratio of extension agents to farmers cannot satisfy the information needs of the farming communities (BALOCH & THAPA, 2014). For instance, in many developing countries the existing agriculture extension system is unable to fulfill the information needs of the farmers due to  limited resources (AKER, 2011). In this regard, the emerging trend of using ICTs for extension and advisory services is commonly prevailing in many developed as well as developing countries (AKER & KSOLL, 2016). The argument that “communication technologies are the future of agricultural extension and countries cannot afford the cost of face to face extension anymore” is commonly prevailed because the cellular phone has a potential to replace the face to face extension system (ALDOSARI et al., 2017). In this context, mobile phone’s role becomes very crucial for the agriculture sector of many developing countries like Pakistan which are facing extreme challenges due to lack of adoption of latest agricultural technologies by the farmers due to the poor access to the latest farm knowledge (REHMAN et al., 2015). This is an alarming situation for a highly agricultural based country like Pakistan.
In Pakistan agriculture sector generates 
nearly 20% of national GDP by employing 45% of the country’s labor force (GOP, 2016). An overwhelming majority of Pakistan’ population lives in rural areas and is engaged in farming and related businesses. Despite the abundance of the labor force in agriculture, Pakistan still lags behind in term of achieving its productivity potential as compared to other countries of the world (REHMAN et al., 2015). For the matter of fact, the agriculture sector of Pakistan faces a huge production gap between the actual and potential yield of various crops (MUDDASSIR et al., 2016; NOOR et al., 2016). Many studies in Pakistan identified several challenges to existing yield gap including non-adoption of latest farm technology (REHMAN et al., 2015). The reason behind the lack of adoption of agricultural innovation is because of farmers’ lack of information access regarding new farm technologies (AHMAD et al., 2016). Since many years in Pakistan, the farmers have been accessing agricultural information through conventional extension methods but due to the increasing population of farmers with respect to extension agents led to the failure of effective extension services in the country (BALOCH & THAPA, 2014). In Pakistan, the case of marginalized communities is even more worst where extension system does not exist at all or if it does, is biased towards the big landlords and influential farmers (ABID et al., 2015). In this situation, communication tools like mobile phone provide effective answers to farmers’ problems to ease communication between the various stakeholders of the agriculture sector.
During the past few years in Pakistan, 
many mobile phone-based initiatives in agricultural extension have been taken by various governmental and non-governmental agencies to assist the farming communities in the country (Figure 5). Use of mobile-based farm advisory services (FAS) was initially started in the developed countries and was later conceived by the developing countries including Pakistan (AKER, 2011). In fact, the application of such models has many  success as most of the farmers in developed countries are resourceful and literate. But for a different setting like in Pakistan where a significant majority of the farmers is illiterate the use Farmers’ use of mobile phone for accessing agricultural information in Pakistan: a case of Punjab province.

and adoption of such models need to be explored. 
Considering the rationale, this study was conducted in a marginalized region of Pakistan to evaluate the role of mobile phone in agricultural knowledge dissemination purposes among those farmers who are  away from the mainstream. Moreover to the authors’ best knowledge, the independent evaluations of these initiatives in Pakistan, particularly in the case of marginalized regions have not yet been taken. Hence this study provided pioneer evidence from these initiatives in Pakistan.
Previously numerous studies have been 
globally conducted regarding the effectiveness of mobile phone and its use in the dissemination of agricultural information to the farmers (SURABHI & MAMTA, 2016; NEHA et al., 2018).  But for the case of marginalized communities as in the current study, thin literature is available globally regarding the use of the mobile phone for agricultural knowledge transfer; to fill this knowledge gap and reach the literature in that context the current study was designed with the following research objectives. 1) to assess farmers’ mobile phone use and related attributes  in  the study area 3) To identify the farmers’ use of various mobile phone-based agricultural information sources and  2) To explore the farmers’ experiences regarding the farm-related use of the mobile phone.
MATERIALS   AND   METHODS
This section outlined the methods which 
are used in the current study. The methodology 
includes study area selection, data collection methods, sample size, sampling approach, and data analysis. The description of the materials and methods used in the study area is explained below.
Study area
The study was conducted in the 
Muzaffargarh district of Punjab Pakistan. 
Muzaffargarh was chosen because the study  aimed to explore the role of  mobile phone for farm knowledge transfer in the marginalized area and Muzaffargarh lies in one of the most underprivileged regions in the country (NA VEED et al., 2016). The study district is located in the south of the Punjab province situated on the bank of head Panjnad (junction of all five rivers of the province). The district Muzaffargarh is comprised of four tehsils occupying a total area of 0.84 m ha. The population of the district is about 4 million, of which majority of the population is rural (87%), relying on agriculture and related businesses (GOP, 2017). Wheat, sugarcane, and cotton are the main crops grown in the area. The major mobile phone-based agricultural information sources available in the study area include government agriculture officers/extension agents, private agricultural companies dealers/staff, private helplines for farming solutions, government  agriculture department helplines and government,  livestock department helplines and SMS services. The present study considered the use of the mobile phone for information transfer in the context of these available agricultural information sources in the study area. Figure 1 shows the map of the study area on the map of Punjab Pakistan.
Data collection and sampling procedure
The data collection was carried out in the 
two tehsils (sub-district) of  Muzaffargarh district 
between the month of February and March 2017. Initially, Muzaffargarh district was purposively selected as the study area  and then a multistage sampling technique was used to collect data. In the first stage, Muzaffargarh District was selected, in the second stage, two tehsils were randomly selected 
among the four tehsils of the district. In the third stage, two rural union councils were randomly chosen (one from each tehsil). In the fourth stage, three villages 
were chosen at random (one from each union council) using Pakistan Village Statistics (GOP, 1998). In the final stage, thirty farmers were selected from each village (based on the farmer’s list obtained from the District Agriculture Department). Union councils are a subsection of city government (sub-district/tehsil) in the local government system of Pakistan and rural union council may consist of various villages (GOP, 1998).  Hence a total sample of 180 farmers was generated. The data were collected by a predesigned 
structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was pre-tested on 20 respondents (out of sample) to check the validity and reliability. The data collection was done at Farmers’ convenient places in their local language and then converted into English. The collected data were then managed and analyzed using SPSS (Statistical package for social sciences) (Figure 2).
RESULTS
Results presented in the study are 
comprised of the descriptive statistics of the surveyed 
respondents. Out of the targeted 180 respondents, 164 of them possessed a mobile phone and were used for data analysis.

pivotal role in understanding its farm-related use 
and factors associated with its adoption. It is argued that farmers possessing mobile phone for a long time have better skills of various operations i.e. making calls, SMS and internet-based mobile and hence increases the mobile phone adoption and use for agricultural purposes (AKER & KSOLL, 2016). In this regard, Farmers’ mobile use related attributes like possession duration and aptitude of its use were initially assessed.Results presented in figure 3 showed 
that the majority (68.3%) of the farmers reported mobile phone use for more than three years, which is a probability of farmers’ better understanding regarding basic operations of the cell phone. Findings also indicated certain challenges for the feasibility of e-extension as a large proportion of farmers indicated possession duration less than three years that can negatively affect their awareness regarding various mobile-based information sources.

Similarly, farmers’ aptitude of mobile 
phone use was also identified by incorporating 
various questions regarding their skills of various types of mobile phone uses.  Results (Figure 4) showed that a significant majority of the farmers was only aware of the basic operation of mobile phones. Less than one-fourth (23.8%) of the farmers indicated SMS writing ability in Urdu language (National Language). Similarly, very few of them indicated the ability to read (16.5%) and write (11%) SMS in the English language. While in terms of advanced operating skills less than 12% of farmers (on average) indicated the use of smartphone applications and other internet-based use of the mobile phone. Farmers’ aptitude of various mobile phone operations is shown in detail in figure 4.

the various use purposes. The findings presented in 
figure 5 revealed that nearly three-fourths of phone bills were spent for personal and domestic use, while the rest one-fourth of the phone bills were reportedly spent on various agricultural related purposes. “market information” represents the highest share of mobile phone bills among the all farm-related uses, while the least proportion of mobile bills was reported for accessing weather forecast. Farmers mobile use pattern is shown in figure 5.
Farmers’ use of various Mobile phone-based 
agricultural information sources
Results shown in figure 6 described the 
agriculture information sources being used by farmers 
in the study area. Farmers were asked about the use of the various mobile phone-based farm information sources available in the study area. According to the findings “private sector companies and input suppliers”  reported the highest used (87.2%) of  information source as compared to the other information sources agricultural department SMS service, call service, livestock department helpline, and private helplines. These responses indicated the farmers’ inclination towards private enterprises and farm input suppliers. Moreover, extension agents’ mobile-based communication showed a higher use as compared to the governmental officials call and SMS 
helplines, which indicated their inefficiency.
Farmers’ perceptions regarding the benefits of farm-
related use of mobile phone
The farmers’ perceptions regarding the 
benefits of mobile phone use were also explored by incorporating a list of various benefits of mobile phone use in accessing farm related information.  In the following statistics (Table 1) a mean value above 3 represents the farmers’ agreement while a mean value below 3 shows the disagreement of a farmer with the particular benefit of mobile phone use. The findings revealed that farmers agreed to all the benefits of using a mobile phone except the usefulness of weather forecast and expert opinion. Detailed responses are shown in table 1.
Constraints in farm-related use of mobile phone
Constraints that limit the farmers’ use of 
the mobile phone to access farm related information 
were also identified in the current study. Farmers were asked to recognize the limitations that hinder the effective utilization of mobile phone in accessing agricultural information from various information sources available in the study area. According to the findings (Table 2), Farmers reported two major constraints to attain the successful utilization of mobile phone for agricultural purposes. These constraints included problems in understanding the information through robocalls and limited aptitude of cell phone use (to calls only) which indicated a lack of education and mobile operating skills of the 
farmers in the study area.
DISCUSSIONFarmers attributes regarding mobile phone use
The literature is evident that farmers’ 
characteristics of mobile phone use such as their 
Figure 5 - Farmers’ Mobile phone use pattern (Mobile bill spending ratio per month).

possession duration and skills and aptitude are 
closely linked with its adoption and use in agriculture (QIANG et al., 2012). Farmer ’s understandings and their basic skills regarding mobile phone use are also considered as mandatory factors for its successful utilizing, as the higher aptitude of mobile phone use increase tendency of accessing agricultural information and hence the farmer’s efficiency (VERMA et al., 2014). Our study in this regard has identified the mobile phone usage related characteristics , which included farmers ownership duration and aptitude of the mobile phone. Results (Figure 3) of our study revealed that that majority of the farmers possessed mobile phone for more than three years these findings are parallel with the study of TADESSE and BAHIIGWA (2015) who indicated a greater probability of farm-related use among these farmers. Similarly, our findings further reported that  the majority of the mobile phone users  had very limited mobile phone aptitude (calls only) and a significant proportion was  unable to read and write text messages (Figure 4). The literature proved that SMS (short message service)  possess a huge potential for the delivery of farm advisory services, but lack of education, awareness, and training poses hampers in the way of successful utilization (ALDOSARI et al., 2017; NEHA et al., 2018). Similar is the case of the present study, where the majority of farmers lacked in reading and writing the text messages (Figure 4). Aside from the basic mobile phone operations, the advanced use of the mobile phone in the form of the Android-based smartphone holds a huge potential as many

agricultural related applications, web portals, and 
social media have more authentic information sources (MANJUPRAKASH et al., 2016). But unluckily farmers in the study area lacked in advanced operating skills to utilize them effectively which highlighted the need for farmers training regarding the use of the mobile phone to access these information sources.
Farm related use of mobile phone
Farmers’ use pattern of the cell phone has 
also been identified in the current study. Findings 
(Figure 5)  indicated most of the cellular phone use as personal (73.3%), parallel with another similar study in India (MEHTA, 2016). This pattern depicts that farmers have the least trend towards formal agriculture-related use. Moreover, the higher trend of domestic and personal use also indicated that farmers may share farm knowledge and experience with their family, fellow farmers and friend’s circles. This strong communication within the close circle gives them a sense of security in terms of farm knowledge exchange and access to required information. For the case of the current study, 26.7% of mobile phone usage has been solely reported for farm-related purposes in which Market information and discussion on farm-related financial matters ranked as the highest accessed agriculture information with the proportion of 12.6% and 8.1% of total mobile phone use (47.2% and 30.3% of farm-related use). These findings are in line with another similar study which stated that farmers mostly rely on the mobile-based communications for their farm-related marketing and financial matters (MASUKA et al., 2016).
Higher use of market information also 
represents its usefulness for farming activities as literature has also endorsed a positive impact of market information on the crop productivity and farm income (KIKULWE et al., 2014; GICHUKI & MULU-MUTUKU, 2018). It is further argued that use of the mobile phone for accessing market information  increased because generally in many rural societies the markets are distant from the farms so farmers use a mobile phone to communicate with local markets and traders (MASUKA et al., 2016). Similarly, 30% of farm-related use of the mobile phone was for “Financial matter”, which showed the farmers reliance on mobile phone-based interaction for their money lending matters and credit services. Farmers in the remote areas use a cell phone for management of their financial transaction; for example, when they need a loan to buy inputs they may access the credit institutions and the fellow farmers to meet their need.
Our study has also identified farmers’ use 
of various agricultural information sources available in the study area (Figure 5). Results of our study reported that farmers accessed private agricultural companies and their advisory staff more frequently (87.2%) as compared to public sectors advisory services. These findings are parallel with another similar study reported in India (VERMA et al., 2014) which reported that farmers prefer to consult the private sector’s agents as they also provided the required inputs in addition to the advisory services. In this way, the private sector’s dealers and suppliers remain connected through the cell phone because of selling their products. While the government sector’s advisory services are solely for information delivery and are reported to be less responsive and the extension agents of the private sector’s input suppliers like fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and other farm-related companies are generally  very responsive in terms of their advisory services (OSABUTEY & JIN, 2016; SAROJ et al., 2017). Similar is the case of our study where the government sector’s SMS and call

helplines and advisory services through extension 
agents are least accesses by the farmers. These findings indicated the lack of interest from the public sector institutions and organization in use of ICT in agriculture and highlighted the need for consideration from the higher authorities in its application in agricultural extension.
Farmers’ perceptions regarding the benefits of farm-
related use of mobile phone
The findings of our study showed that 
farmers agreed to various benefits of the mobile phone (table 1) and indicated “Access to updated information” and “increased connectivity with stakeholders” as the highest perceived benefits. These results revealed that access to updated information has significantly helped the farming communities. It is argued that the mobile phone has enabled the farmers to negotiate the local markets in order to sell their products with higher profits (TADESSE & BAHIIGWA, 2015). Similarly, while purchasing the inputs and various farm equipment, smallholders communicate with markets to check the availability, quantity, quality and the prices of the required item. This also reduced transportation cost as they fix the deal with local commission markets prior to transport their commodities. Findings of our study are parallel with the other studies which stated that access to the latest information has significantly improved farmers income (KIKULWE et al., 2014; GICHUKI & MULU-MUTUKU, 2018). Moreover, “increased connectivity with stakeholders” indicated that the mobile phone by penetrating the local demographics has significantly strengthened the connectivity of farming communities and positively impacted their agriculture and related businesses. The literature stated that mobile phone has equipped the farmers to establish a network with various stakeholders in agriculture like traders, consumers and many institutions (MASUKA et al., 2016). Results hence proved cell phone technology as an effective ICT tool which made farmer to farmer communications more flexible and easier. Farmers now are no more away from the mainstream and can actively engage themselves in any kind of local cooperation, business and can make informed decisions.
 Our study has also reported farmers’ 
disagreement with benefits of the mobile phone which included “usefulness of weather forecast” and usefulness of expert opinions”.  Here expert opinion referred as the emergency assistance or help being provided by farm advisory institutions and organization (through call helplines or SMS services) to the farmers in the study area while weather forecast means delivery of weather updates and rain predictions provided to the farmers.  Disagreement with the benefits of experts’ opinion indicated the farmers’ incompatibility with the provided information. This showed that farmers may not get information according to their actual requirement i.e. financial situation and contextual feasibility. Similarly, disagreement with the usefulness of weather forecast indicateds certain hampers and constraints as a reason which needs to be explored and addressed. These constraints can be in the form of un-authentic and unreliable weather forecast resources in the study area due to which farmers find these services useless. Literature in this regard has also indicated another reason due to which farmers may find weather forecast un-useful because of their more reliance on traditional beliefs and knowledge of local climate. For example, farmers in many traditional societies and regions predict the arrival of any drought or rainy season by the changing pattern of winds, so they rely more on their local knowledge (FITCHETT & EBHUOMA, 2018).
Constraints in farm-related use of mobile phone
Findings of the current study have also 
reported certain limitations in the use of mobile phone 
among the farmers (Table 2). According to the results, farmers indicated two major constraints “problems in understanding the information through robocalls” and “limited aptitude of cell phone use (calls only) (4.02 & 4.12 mean). The limited aptitude of the cell phone use indicated farmers’ very basic knowledge of cell phone use limited to making and receiving the calls only which has already been identified in the previous section (Figure 4). These findings are in line with the other studies which have also indicated digital illiteracy among the major constraints of mobile use among the farmers (OSABUTEY & JIN, 2016; SURABHI & MAMTA, 2016; SAROJ et al., 2017). Currently, most of the agricultural knowledge lies in sources like websites, e-magazines, internet portals, and mobile phone android apps (MANJUPRAKASH et al., 2016). Similarly in Pakistan various ICT-based agricultural information sources like Cyber extension, ICT-enabled community center, Bakhabar Kissan (The well aware farmer), and UAF-clinic, etc. have also been launched in order to provide farming solutions to the Pakistani farmers (JALLO, 2016; JAZZ, 2018). These multiple sources of information need internet access and advanced operating skills which unfortunately farmers lack in the study area (Figure 4). Likewise, farmers indicated the problems Farmers’ use of mobile phone for accessing agricultural information in Pakistan: a case of Punjab province.
Ciência Rural, v.49, n.10, 2019.10
in understanding the information through the 
robocalls because in some cases, these pre-recorded voice calls-based information services do not satisfy the information needs of farmers in a way that there is no clarification if any unclear information or doubt arises. Similar findings have been reported in India  (SHANKARAIAH & SWAMY , 2012).
CONCLUSION
In the scenario of extreme challenges in 
the transfer of knowledge to the farmers in Pakistan, 
cellular phone-based advisory services have emerged as an effective alternative which has transformed the conventional extension methods of information exchange. The current study in this regard focused on the use of mobile phone-based agricultural information sources between the farmers and the extension agencies.
Initially, the current study identified 
mobile adoption rate and farmers aptitude regarding its use as it was prerequisite to further explore its farm-related use.  The findings reported that majority of the farmers had mobile phone possession but indicated very basic operating skills limited to call only. Due to this limited aptitude of mobile phone farmers were  unable to access information from various Internet-based information sources like web portals and android applications. This may pose a huge challenge as most of the authentic information lies over these web-based sources and social media forums which need advanced operating skill. This urges the need for training and educating the farmers regarding the use of these available information sources to utilize the true potential of mobile phone. The current study also recommends the practitioners in the field of e-extension to consider the farmers’ digital literacy prior to starting ICT-based initiatives in such communities. Moreover, there is a need to implement capacity building programmes that will lead to the acquisition of the required skills for enhanced utilization of the delivered content.
Despite many mobile-based information 
sources most of the farmers do not utilize it, as only one-fourth of the mobile phone use was reported for agricultural related communications. This indicates farmers’ lack of awareness about the available information sources and seeks the attention from the policymakers to mainstream these initiatives. This could be attained by organizing awareness campaigns by the concern departments among the farmers which are the key target of these projects. Moreover, it was reported that among all the available agriculture information sources, the private sector’s farm advisory services were highly accessed as compared to the public sector mobile-based services. These findings indicated the lack of interest from government institutions and concerned authorities in the promotion and use of ICT-based information services in agriculture. Conversely, this also indicated the huge potential of the private sector in terms of its service delivery to which public sector institutions can acquire a lesson. In this regard, serious efforts are required from the public sector’s institutions and policymakers to pay attention to these ICT based initiatives as these are the contemporary mode of extension and countries like Pakistan cannot afford the cost of face to face extension.
Market information and financial matters 
which were reported as the most accessed agricultural 
information indicated the farmers’ reliance on mobile-based communication in rural areas. This further indicated that easy access to market information and financial transaction through mobile phone has made the farmers more connected to the mainstream. According to the farmers’ experience with the farm-related use of mobile phone, access to updated information and easy connectivity with stakeholders were identified as the highest perceived benefits in terms of service delivery and timeliness. While in term of provided content weather forecast was perceived as the least effective among the farmers. This highlighted an 
immediate need of attention from the weather agencies and concerned organization to ensure the provision of accurate and area-specific weather information to the farming communities in the study area as the weather is an important factor in farming and crop cultivation. Moreover, the ineffectiveness of agricultural advisor’s opinion predicts certain incompatibilities between the delivered information and farmers needs and hence this study recommends the provision of farm-related content tailored according to the farmers’ actual needs.
Similarly, the reported vagueness in the 
Robocalls (pre-recorded voice message) urges the 
need to consider such a mode of communication in which farmers can give their concern if they feel any doubts about the provided information. Moreover, farmers’ limited aptitude of the mobile phone which was also reported as a major limitation in acquiring farm knowledge; therefore, this study recommended the information delivery using a simpler mean that requires very basic mobile operating skills.

Abstract
Since mid-March 2020, educational systems worldwide and particularly Ghana were under increasing pressure to use the new Digital Technologies (DTs) and mobile applications (apps) to assist teachers in guiding students to continue with online learning activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is aimed at assessing the utilization of DTs and apps tools by students during the COVID-19 pandemic and how those technologies have affected online learning in institutions of higher education in Ghana. The researcher adopted an online survey and exploratory-based design that utilized quantitative and qualitative approaches to purposively collect data from N=784 students from three major public universities in Ghana. Also, the study applied Uses and Gratification as the theoretical basis in understanding the utilization of DTs and their possible limitations for remote learning during the peak of COVID-19 in Ghana. This study reported that the specific DMTs and mobile apps used by students in higher education for online learning are smarts phones and apps such as Class In, Zoom, Skype, and Instagram live stream. This study also revealed that Personal Learning Network (PLN) such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter were also actively used by students for remote online learning. Again, the study shows that 77.1% of students in the sampled three universities were fully aware of the DTs and apps utilized for online learning during COVID-19. Also, the findings from this study report that students in higher institutions identified unstable electricity for continuous online learning, especially for those students in rural areas, unreliable internet service, poor WiFi connections, expensive smartphones / laptops, and high cost of inter bundle as key challenges of using DMTs and mobile apps for online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, on the perceived usefulness of DTs and mobile apps among students for online learning in higher educational institutions, the findings from this study suggest that DMT’s and apps were of great benefit to students for remote online learning.Keywords: Educational systems, Digital technologies, Applications (apps), COVID-19 pandemic, Online learning
Introduction
 The year 2020 will go down in the history of the world as the most 
devastating year that affected almost every facet of human existence. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and organizations worldwide have initiated all sorts of inventive projects, exhaustive research work, and activities that encourage knowledge-sharing regarding the effective and appropriate application of Digital Technologies (DTs) in the education systems (Mingis, 2020). While countries in the developed world have needed technology and infrastructure to prosecute for online learning via technology, their counter parts in the developing world can not apply. The digital divide among countries of the world was brought to bear by COVID-19 and has affected online learning delivery in developing countries (Demuyakor, 2020; Ferri, et al., 2020; Chatterjee & Chakraborty, 2020; European Commission Joint Research Centre, 2020).

#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 27 Education is a social endeavor. Therefore, there 
is a need to empower both the teachers and students 
to teach and learn, respectively through Digital Technologies (DTs) and mobile applications (apps). The students and teachers should be trained on Digital Technologies and applications because adapting to pedagogy is essential in the current world (Lakhal, & Khechine, 2021; Lam, et al., 2021). A combination of different modes of teaching (offline / online or a combination of both) is considered to be more effective with more focus being put on pedagogy and not just using technology (García-Martínez, et al., 2019; Montrieux, et al., 2015; Rapanta, et al., 2020).  Lengthy closure of schools in Ghana and many 
African countries due to COVID-19 is likely to cause not just a loss in teaching and learning among the teachers and students in the short term but also a decline of the human capital and reduced chances of economic opportunities in the long run (Amewu, et al., 2020; Adarkwah, 2020). Most countries are trying to cope with the closure of the school and are trying out online learning as a way of ensuring that there is continuity of knowledge acquisition among the learners. In 2020, a World Bank report titled “the COVID-19 pandemic: shocks to education and policy responses” pointed out that to effectively mitigate the loss of learning, most countries are trying out new technology means of teaching to cope with the predicament. The situation has exposed the existence of inequalities as far as digital access is concerned, and that ‘business as usual’ may not work for the transfer of education to all students. This study aims at evaluating the effects and use of DTs and mobile applications (apps) during the COVID-19 on higher education and how these technologies have helped students to continue with their online learning. 
Literature Review
Education and COVID-19 Pandemic The Global Education Coalition of the UNESCO 
report 2020 cited that, at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide lockdowns, 1.6 billion students were seriously affected by the closure of schools. This caused one of the largest mass disruptions of the education system in modern history (UNICEF, 2020 & UNESCO, 2020). Despite all this, before the nationwide closure of schools, UNICEF & UNESCO had reported that one in five school-going children were already out of school, and even those that were already in school were not receiving the appropriate learning. Close to 617 million children and adolescents across the globe failed to attain the minimum proficiency level in both mathematics and reading. To successfully address the serious issues, over 90% of the education ministries worldwide came up with some form of remote learning policy. Together with other stakeholders, they have sought to apply modern technology to improve the levels of education (UNESCO, 2020 and UNICEF, 2020) To respond to the unexpected challenges in the 
education sector brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, over 90% of the countries worldwide have managed to implement some online learning programs (De Giusti, 2020; Li & Lalani, 2020). According to the survey carried out by UNICEF (2020) and UNESCO (2020), the factsheet approximates that about 463 million students have been left out of digital learning due to lack of the required sources in various homes and poor policies by various government agencies. This information was received from joint research carried out by UNESCO, UNICEF, and World Bank survey regarding the National Response to COVID-19 school closure (June-July 2020). It has to be understood that the actual number of students who could not be reached for the response was likely to be higher compared to what was indicated in the factsheet. However, the figure represented the best-case scenario if the policies that were implemented and technologies used were anything to go by. In many instances, despite the policies that were in place and the availability of technology in various homes, the learners may not be able to learn because of the presence of huddles among the teachers or lack of support from the parents.  It is essential to be aware of the number of children 
who did not get the opportunity to benefit from digital learning opportunities because this will help improve the policies. By highlighting the challenges faced by children who did not benefit from online learning during school closure occasioned by COVID-19 pandemic, the factsheet seeks to provide choices that will help in improving the situation through ensuring that children can acquire education during COVID-19 period and beyond. With the emergence of the Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 28COVID-19 pandemic, some issues are evolving in the 
technology sector. Teaching and learning methods are improving, especially from teacher-centered and lecture-based instruction to student-centered with minimal interaction. There has been an increase in the designing and implementation of ICT-based educational reforms during the COVID-19 period is the key to fundamental to covering the educational calendar (Trust, 2020; Espino-Díaz, et al., 2020; UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020). The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic led to 
almost 1 billion children falling behind because of the closure of learning institutions to control the spread of COVID-19. To ensure that learning was going on during the period, countries introduced information and communication technology programs through distance learning, especially online learning, as a means of continuing the engagement of students at all levels of the education ladder (Li & Lalani, 2020 and Drane, et al., 2020). Yet, most children worldwide cannot access the internet in their homes, especially those from poor households. Facilities like TVs, personal computers, and radios are a luxury to most homes, which defined the existing learning inequalities. There is a lack of new technologies that can aid in the acquisition of knowledge through home-based learning. Consequently, many children are faced with the possibility of not going back to school, which could pose the risk of undoing the many steps of progress that had already been achieved across the world (UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020). According to UNICEF COVID-19 and 
Education report, as of April 2020, 188 countries have closed schools, a number of the schools are looking for alternative ways of teaching through the use of technologies such as the Internet, TV, and Radio. The main stumbling block has, however, been the minimal access of the technologies among the low and middle-income countries because most households cannot afford them (Bloom et al., 2017). While 90% of the countries embraced digital learning, only 60% did for pre-primary levels of education (UNICEF, 2020; Li & Lalani, 2020; Ferri, et al., 2020). The measures that have been taken by various governments to ensure that there is continuity of learning through digital platforms enabled 69% of the children across the globe to continue learning. Nevertheless, 31% of the children, which translated to 463 million children, across the world could not be reached through broadcast and online learning. This was either due to a lack of technological equipment such as the internet and computers, or the policies that were put in place were not well executed (UNESCO, 2020 and UNICEF, 2020).  During the period when the schools remained 
closed, most governments resorted to delivering education through online platforms. Close to 83 of the countries used the platform to impart knowledge to the learners (Lyons, et al., 2020 and Dhawan, 2020). However, only a quarter of the students were able to access learning through the platform. Television had the highest percentage with about 62% globally. 16% accessed the learning through the radio. Globally, 3 out 4 students who could not be reached online came from rural areas and belonged to the poorest households. It is important to note that expanding access to the internet as well as digital learning solutions for students across the world would be the best long-term strategy in reducing learning vulnerabilities as a result of COVID-19 (World Bank, 2020; UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020; United Nations, 2020).
DTs and Mobile Apps used for Online Learning 
by Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic In addition to the already existing Digital 
Technological (DTs) and mobile apps, the UNESCO and UNICEF, World Health Organization (WHO) report that as of July 2020, about 50 national governments have released various applications to assist the fight against Covid-19. According to a 2020 study carried out by UNICEF and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), about 2.2 billion children, which translates to two-thirds of children and young adults aged two and below, do not have access to the internet in their home. This is based on the report “How Many Children and Youth Have Internet Access at Home” in a joint effort by UNICEF and ITU. Through the use of the latest household survey data, the report found out that there are significant inequalities between various countries and regions. The report pointed out the differences in wealth groups and urban-rural settings. For instance, it was discovered that only 5% of the children and Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 29young adults in both central and West Africa have 
internet access at home compared to 33%, which is the global average. There is also a huge disparity between the rich and the developing countries. About 6% of children and young adults in low-income countries can access the internet compared to 87% in high-income countries. To ensure that students can comfortably acquire knowledge and skills, it is important to expand internet access to students to support a sustainable future. To this end, UNICEF and ITU have come together to launch Giga, an ambitious initiative to ensure that all schools are connected to the internet. Through the support of Generation Unlimited, UNICEF as an organization is working under Reimagine Education initiative to address the learning crisis and transform the education sector by providing students and young adults equal access to quality online learning (UNESCO, 2020; UNICEF, 2020; ITU, 2020). According to UNESCO (2020), the COVID-19 
has transformed and the students out of their traditional teaching and learning environment and shifted to online learning. By responding to the effects of COVID-19, the faculty of education has swiftly transitioned the whole pre-clerkship curriculum online. This is done by arranging smaller groups to meet in smaller groups. Students use many online learning technologies to ensure that there is continuity of education regardless of the presence of COVID-19 (Demuyakor, 2020; Chatterjee & Chakraborty, 2020; Vargo et al., 2020; Yoshida, 2021). Online collaboration tools, as well as social 
media applications, are among the popular choices for students compared to university websites. This is because they are more convenient and exclusively interactive (Demuyakor, 2020). They allow for collaborative discussions on important topics that are of great importance to the learners (Sarwar et al., 2019; Ayebi-Arthur, 2017; Chatterjee & Chakraborty, 2020). Facebook groups are used to host those kinds of discussions (Chatterjee, & Chakraborty, 2020; Dawson & Al-Masri, 2020). One other popular medium of facilitation of discussion is WhatsApp. Just like Instagram live streaming, WhatsApp is a technology that is supported through social media-based live streaming services (Motteram, et al., 2020; Chatterjee, & Chakraborty, 2020; Cole et al., 2017). Social media platforms provide avenues for live teaching and learning. Discussions are enhanced through qualified personalities like professors. There is a need to encourage teleconferencing and audience response methods to promote the participation of students during the lessons. Both video conferencing and collaboration tools allow students, teachers as well as school administrators to carry out related practical courses. LinkedIn and Twitter have consistently enabled professors and students to advance their interaction through resourceful engagements (Ngalomba, 2020; Azlan, 2020; Sukardi, 2019; Kapoor, 2018; Willbold, 2019).  As part of the fulfillment of the education process, 
attending lectures delivered by professors plays a great role in knowledge acquisition. Teachers who attended those important lectures are now sharing the prerecorded lectures with their students in class. Others find it better to live-stream the lectures to the students. During the learning sessions, students are encouraged to ask questions through a chat response or video conferencing. At the same time, sessions may be recorded (Pillai, et al., 2021; Free, et al., 2021). The entire process requires a considerable amount of time and effort to assemble multimedia resources as well as simulation tools that are required for teaching a course, yet not many of the same kinds of tools are currently in use now (Rapanta, et al., 2020; Vargo, et al., 2020). Rapanta, et al. (2020) and Houlden & Veletsianos (2020) recommend students be able to attend online conferences both within and outside their universities and seek to be provided with the best possible mentorship based on a one-on-one or in small groups. According to UNESCO (2020) and UNICEF (2020), online symposiums can be carried out to foster education and research. The symposiums can be carried out through the use of posters, holding discussions, and organizing talks. Practical skill lessons can also be delivered online, though there are several challenges. Practical courses typically require more time and resources to be handled virtually (Roddy, et al., 2017).  According to Roddy, et al., (2017) and Vargo, et 
al., (2020), examinations are also transitioning into the virtual way. Preparing for any future academic session, such as selecting potential candidates, will Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 30be carried out virtually through video conferencing 
(Roddy, et al., 2017). Teachers are trying hard to keep the educational approach simple but at the same time coming up with innovations and transitioning teaching techniques from the normal face-to-face instructions to the current modern technology where sessions are carried out virtually (Arkorful, et al., 2021). The focus and future of DMTs remain on innovation and exploring new environments through novel technologies and adaptation to flexible learning plans (Rapanta, et al., 2020; Boni, 2018). The World Bank Education Global Practice 
report, 2020 argues that, as countries continue to adapt and invest in new technologies to learn online as an immediate way of reaching out to students, there are challenges that are faced (World Bank, 2020; Free, et al., 2021). During this coping phase period, rather than simply coming with new content that is likely to take a significant amount of time and a high level of expertise, it is essential that countries concentrate on curating the available content, which free and open to all, on aligning it to the new curriculum (Cromwell, 2020 and World Bank, 2020). As a way of preparing for the future, countries need to develop short modular content to be distributed through various channels, mobile being the basic channel. Re-imagining how content is designed should be able to look into the unique skills and general background of the students give various options through which the students can be able to realize their full potential. During the coping stages, examination and evaluation of the process have exposed several limitations. In situations where online systems are applied in teaching, the data collected provide a clear picture of progress made in learning (Kingsbury, 2021). In situations where students apply online learning through radio and TV, which have minimal interaction, short questions and feedback through mobile devices are used to facilitate engagement between the teachers and students. The use of both digital content, data, algorithms, among others, can provide continuous feedback to the students (Mills, et al., 2020; Montgomery, 2015; Winthrop, 2020).Challenges of Online Learning in Higher Education during the COVID-19 Pandemic One of the greatest challenges for online learning 
during COVID-19 is the increased level of inequality as far as access to internet technology is concerned (Ferri, et al., 2020). According to A 2020 UNICEF report, for instance, indicated that, in homes of elementary school-going students in Africa, only thirty percent of the poor household could access radio services while 79% of the rich household have radios (UNESCO, 2020 and UNICEF, 2020).  The disparity in the ownership of TV among 
the poor and the rich also evident, with only 4% of the poor and 82% of the rich. The computer has 1% for the poor and 25% for the rich. Only 0.3% can access the internet among the poor which the rich households have 25% access to the internet. There is, however, some little hope as far as the use of mobile phones is concerned as 46% of the poor household have a phone while rich is at 79% (UNESCO, 2020).  The distribution of digital content can be done 
through various channels to ensure that it reaches all students on a wider scale. Consequently, the systems of education should be able to come up with multi-faceted solutions to leverage the available technologies such as the radio, TV, computers, internet, among others. The combination of the various mediums can ensure that students are fully engaged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mixed-mode delivery has to be adopted by the stakeholders so that all students access the necessary learning. The education system should address the inequality in access to the internet and the associated devices (UNESCO, 2020; United Nations, 2020; UNICEF, 2020).
The Theoretical Underpinning of the Study
 Upon a careful review of the literature, one 
can conclude that several theories might apply to this study. The theory that strongly relates to the content of this paper and can aid in given many explanations is the theory of Uses and Gratification (UGT). For us to have a better understanding of what motivates students and teachers to use digital mobile technologies during the COVID-19, Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT) (Trowbidge, 1976) must be examined. This theory is premised Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 31on the audience’s point of view. It is Katz, et al., 
(1973) based on some core this theory stands on the audience’s (students and teachers) theatrical and methodological assumptions; the audience (students and teachers) is active and goal-oriented, taking a proactive role in deciding how to use media in their lives, the audience (students and teachers) knows their needs and is choosing the media to meet their own needs by linking their needs to a specific medium, the media is competing with other resources for the need of satisfaction, and the audience(students and teachers) is well-aware of their usage, interests, and value judgments (López, et al., 2019; Raza, et al., 2016). The four core indices of UGT are Personal Identity, Education/output, Entertainment, Personal Relationships as well as Social Interactions. Digital Technologies (DTs) serve all four gratifications identified. DTs are entertained, knowledge dissemination, and socialized. Often enough, users find their sense of humor by following DTs that have academic discussions and quotes and pictures that amuse them (Chuang, 2015).

 From the theoretical framework and review of 
literature, the researcher developed the following research questions to guide this study;
Research Questions (RQ)
 RQ1. What is the level of awareness on Digital 
Technologies (DTs) and mobile apps used among university students for online learning? RQ2. What specific DTs and mobile apps did 
students used for online learning during COVID-19? RQ3. What is the perceived usefulness of the 
DTs and mobile apps for online learning among university students during COVID-19? RQ4. What are the perceived challenges 
university students face using DTs and mobile apps for online learning during COVID-19?
Research Methodology
Study Site and Population of the Study The researcher randomly chooses 3 public 
universities for the study are: The University for Development Studies, the University of Cape Coast, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. The choice of these universities was to give a fair representation of the public. The universities cut across three regions in Ghana, namely the Northern Region, Central Region, and Ashanti Regions. The justification for purposively sampling the three institutions of higher learning is to give a fair representation of the north-south divide in Ghana. The study population is 798 students of the three sampled institutions of higher education in Ghana. The population included students from the three sampled universities. 
Study Design
 This particular study employed the use of an 
online survey as well as an exploratory-based design that utilized a quantitative and qualitative approach to examine digital mobile technologies are used by students in three of Ghana’s best institutions of higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic for online learning.
Sampling Procedure and Data Collection and 
Analysis An online survey technique was employed 
as a data-gathering instrument. The respondents were deliberately selected to take part in this particular study, with the selection being based on characteristics that were relevant to this research. As noted by Creswell (2018), the logic behind purposeful sampling usually lies in picking information-rich cases to facilitate in-depth study. A study sample of N=798 respondents comprising students and teachers was employed for this particular study. Out of the N=798 students purposefully sampled from the three major institutions of higher education, n=784 questionnaires were validly filled, which translates to 98.2% of the total sampled population. Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 32 The survey questions enabled the researchers 
not only to probe further but also to understand 
and explore respondents’ contributions (Kaufman, 2020). All 30 online survey questionnaires were administered. This approach permitted the researchers to conduct an in-depth investigation of how the use of digital mobile technologies and apps among students during the COVID-19 pandemic has affected online learning practice in Ghana. The online survey design contained a five-point Likert scale (1= strongly disagree, 2 = somewhat disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4= somewhat agree, 5 = strongly agree ).
 The online survey questionnaire was sent via 
the WhatsApp group pages of the students who volunteered to participate in the study. Every week, the administrators of the various WhatsApp group page sent a reminder to students requesting them to fill the questionnaire. The data collection took four months (October 2020 to January 2021), with every online questionnaire lasting about 10 minutes. SPSS version-24 was employed to facilitate statistical analysis. The collected data were prepared for analysis, with 20% of the data scrutinized for accuracy, and all the data verified to establish discrepancies. Standard descriptive data were employed in summarizing respondents’ characteristics, as well as their access to and perception regarding digital mobile technologies and applications use in the provision of public healthcare. Lastly, percentages, mean as well as standard deviation were employed to establish discrepancies in terms of digital mobile technologies and applications use, access, as well as preferences.
Validity and Reliability
 To ensure the meticulousness and integrity of the 
study and consequently guarantee the credibility of the research findings, various steps were undertaken to improve the reliability of this particular study (Noble & Smith, 2015 and smith & Noble, 2014). First, comparisons were undertaken to establish the similarities and the differences across the respondents’ accounts, an action aimed at ensuring that divergent viewpoints were represented. Furthermore, an active and continual reflection was carried out during the process of data interpretation to not only guarantee the quality of the collected data but also to mirror the respondents’ experiences. Hence, as enhance the credibility of the study. The background of this research, as well as the assumptions relevant to this study, was comprehensibly described to attain transferability. Besides, the criteria used were made clear to suit not only the objective of the study but also its orientation (Sundler, 2019). Furthermore, the views of other researchers were taken into account to help minimize research bias, as well as ensure that findings, conclusions, and recommendations were in line with the collected data and that the interpretation of the collected data was relevant to the research.

Students Face using DTs and Mobile Apps for Online Learning During COVID-19 The fourth research question was intended to 
solicit students’ views of some of the challenges the students encountered while using DTs and mobile apps for online learning. The following are some of the average scores of concerns on the limitations of using DTs and mobile apps for online learning by students in Ghana; “many students lack the required media literacy is skills to enable them to participate fully in online learning during COVID-19” (Mean=2.80, SD=1.40), “laptops and smart mobile devices are very expensive, hence preventing a good number of students from participating in the online classes (M=3.89, SD=1.40); the internet service is unreliable in Ghana, hence limiting us from using DTs and apps for online learning” (Mean=3.89, SD=1.46), “The internet service is unreliable in Ghana, hence limiting us from using DTs and apps for online learning (Mean=4.02, SD=1.9), and internet data is very expensive hence preventing many students from using DTs and apps (Mean=3.92, SD=1.30), and challenge of unstable electricity continues online learning (Mean=3.98, SD=1.49), (See Table 5);

Discussion
 COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly has posted 
so much destruction to the educational practices in most counties of the world. The educational systems within most developing countries, especially Ghana, which were already facing challenges, have been further damaged. From this study, it very clear the adoption of DTs and mobile apps has greatly reduced the impact of the COVID-19 on educational practices. In finding possible answers to the four main research questions of this study, the following were some of the key responses and issues. The first research question was to ascertain 
whether students were aware of some of the DTs and mobile apps used in educational practices (online learning). The study revealed that a considerable number of students that participated in the study were so much aware and had knowledge of the DTs and mobile apps used for online learning in higher educational institutions in Ghana. Out of the Shanlax
International Journal of Education shanlax
#SINCE1990http://www.shanlaxjournals.com 35total of 784 students sampled for this study, 655 
respondents, representing 77.1%, indicated that yes, they were aware of the various DTs and apps used in their educational institutions. The researcher concludes that the level of awareness of DTs and mobile apps among students for online learning in higher educational institutions in Ghana may help ease use and hence improve educational outcomes. This finding from our study is in line with a previous study by (Pillai et al., 2021; Bloom et al., 2020 and Ngampornchai & Adams, 2016). The second research questions address the 
specific DTs and mobile apps used by students for online learning during COVID-19. This study reports that the specific DTs and mobile apps used by students for online learning are; Smarts phones and applications (class In, zoom, skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram live stream), and constitute 56.6% of the sampled students. The second specific DTs used by students for online learning in higher educational institutions according to this study are; laptop computers, which is 26.4% of the sample for the study.  The next research question was to find out the 
perceived usefulness of the DTs and mobile apps to Students for online learning during COVID-19. The study reports that students indicate the DTs and apps were very useful to them. With a mean of (μ = 4.94) and SD of 2.44, most of the students reported that DTs and mobile apps aided them to participate in online classes and other educational activities organized by their various schools. The students also indicated that DTs and mobile apps have greatly aided them in completing the research assignments online on time.  Finally, the researcher again wanted to find 
answers to the research question on the challenges of DMTs and apps for online learning in higher educational institutions during COVID-19. Evidence from this study shows that respondents identified poor WiFi connections, internet service as unreliable, expensive smartphones, and high cost of inter bundle as a critical challenge to the use of DTs and apps for educational activities of online learning during the peak of COVID-19 in Ghana.  Another Challenge reported by students in this 
study is the challenge of unstable electricity for continuous online learning, especially for those students in rural areas in Ghana. This finding is a study in line with Demuyakor (2020) Adarkwah, (2020), and Arkorful, et al., (2021), who did a similar study on the use of technology in education. Ghana and many other developing countries lack the needed internet infrastructural supports to implement emergency online learning as a result of the COVID-19.  As reported in this study, the high cost of 
the internet remains a challenge to many higher educational institutions in Ghana. Also, smart cell phones are being utilized to enhance the delivery as well as the reception of educational practice via online learning is also very expensive. The findings from this study again show that many students in higher educational institutions could not participate in all the educational activities organized by their schools. Hence the cost of participating in any off-campus educational activities by the students will require them to bear the cost. 
Conclusion
 From the discussions and analysis of this 
study, it is worth noting that the finding from this study point to the fact that, COVID-19 pandemic has revolutionized the use of digital technologies and mobile apps in the higher education system in Ghana. Digital technologies and mobile apps have proven to be essential tools for students to continue online learning educational activities without much destruction. 
Limitation of Study and Suggestions for Future 
Research This study was carried out at three universities in 
Ghana; the University for Development Studies, the University of Cape Coast, and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science. Shortly, other researchers could conduct studies on higher education, COVID-19, and DTs and mobile apps on a large scale to include more universities, students, and teachers, and school administrators. Findings from this study indicate that DTs and mobile apps can benefit educational stakeholders and policymakers, which could ensure accessibility, security, reliability, and sustainability of educational programs in post-Shanlax

Abstract
Adoption rates of mobile financial services within sub-Saharan Africa still appear to be below par. The 2016
Groupe Spe ´ciale Mobile Association report shows that over 60 per cent of the adult population in sub- Saharan
Africa do not use mobile financial services. We investigate how cognitive resources, namely, mobile phone
skills and English literacy, influence the use of mobile financial services. We test our hypotheses using a sample
of 208 individuals from an urban location in Central Uganda. We measure actual mobile phone skill using a
newly developed scale. The results show that a marginal increase in mobile phone skills has a strong effect on
the odds of adopting mobile money, but a less strong effect on the extent to which the functionalities of the
mobile money application are used. On the other hand, English literacy has no influence on both adoption and
the magnitude of services individuals use.

Introduction
Following the rapid diffusion of mobile phones in
Africa, the impact of mobile technology can be found
in various domains. Mobile phones in developing
countries have been associated with: job creation and
entrepreneurship (Afutu-Kotey et al., 2017; Asongu
et al., 2017); access to credit facilities for small busi-
nesses leading to growth (Asongu and Odhiambo,
2017); income redistribution among the poor and
gender income equality (Asongu, 2015); good gov-
ernance, both politically and economically (Asongu
and Nwachukwu, 2016); higher productivity in
agriculture (Issahaku et al., 2017); as well as financial
inclusion (Peruta, 2017). In this paper, we payparticular attention to mobile technology in the finan-
cial inclusion realm with an emphasis on understand-
ing the role that cognitive resources play in adoption
and use.
Financial inclusion is a situation within which indi-
viduals have access to financial services tailored to
their needs (Peruta, 2017). In general, developing
countries post poor financial inclusion demographics

(Zins and Weill, 2016). People in developing coun-
tries face many challenges and constrains in access to
finances and financial services (see for example,
Solano and Rooks, 2018). Mobile financial services
have taken center stage in improving financial inclu-
sion in many developing countries (De Albuquerque
et al., 2016; Donovan, 2012; Kikulwe et al., 2014;
Murendo et al., 2018; Nyeko et al., 2014). The use
of mobile financial services by the unbanked has been
recognized as one of the best opportunities for eco-
nomic growth, poverty alleviation, and establishing
financial security in developing countries (Mothobi
and Grzybowski, 2017; Peruta, 2017). The most pop-
ular mobile-based financial service in these countries
is ‘mobile money’. Mobile money is a mobile-based
platform that allows individuals to make financial
transactions using cell phone technology (Jack and
Suri, 2011; Murendo et al., 2018).
The first mobile phone-based money transfer sys-
tem (M-PESA) that allowed individuals to deposit,
send, and withdraw funds using their cell phones was
introduced in Kenya in the year 2007 (Donovan,
2011; Etim, 2014; Jack and Suri, 2011). (‘M’ for
mobile, ‘pesa ’is Swahili for money) With limited
access to formal financial institutions, the aim of this
platform was to extend and include the ‘poorest of the
poor’ in the financial circle (Peruta, 2017). M-PESA
has since then grown rapidly, spilling over into neigh-
boring states under disparate code names by telecom
providers and is widely viewed as a success story to
be emulated across the developing world (Donovan,
2012). Extending financial services to the unbanked,
mobile money improves productivity while lowering
the cost of transactions (Aron, 2015; Jack and Suri,
2011; Peruta, 2017). Focusing on Uganda, there is
evidence that mobile money has improved rural
household incomes through remittances from urban
areas (Kikulwe et al., 2014; Munyegera and Matsu-
moto, 2016). In other countries, mobile money has
generated employment opportunities and created a
platform on which other businesses grow (Kendall
et al., 2012). Moreover, since access to mobile money
funds is safeguarded by the use of personal identifi-
cation numbers (PIN codes), mobile money provides
a secure method of savings for rural populations who
have limited access to formal financial institutions
and face risks caused by traditional means of money
transfer and saving (Duncombe and Boateng, 2009;
Jack and Suri, 2011; Kikulwe et al., 2014).
Despite the increasing number of people adopting
it, mobile money is still far from being widespread(Etim, 2014; Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions, 2015, 2016b). According to the World Bank1
indicators, only 35 %of the population in Uganda was
using mobile money in the year 2014. Subsequently,
the 2016 financial inclusion report on Uganda2
reflected an increase in mobile money adopters from
35%(2014) to 48 %(2016). This report categorizes
mobile money non-users as primarily poor and less
educated with limited access to technology, and a lack
of requisite skills as their biggest barriers. These
encumbrances, however, are not tested empirically
and have remained anecdotal findings.
To use mobile money, individuals need certain
skills. Given that mobile mo ney platforms operate
on mobile phone technology, and predominantly
function using the English language, it is expected
that before one can apprec iate and efficiently use
mobile money services, one has to possess at least
basic technical mobile phone skills and linguistic abil-
ities. In developing countries, where the digital divide
is still a challenge, and large inequalities in literacy,
access, and use of technology exist (Alampay and
Bala, 2010; Gebremichael and Jackson, 2006; Medhi
et al., 2011), not everyone can operate a mobile
phone. Also, the English language, though widely
used formally and integrated into the education sys-
tem, is not native to many countries, even more so in
sub-Saharan Africa (Negash, 2011).
Literature review
Mobile money refers to a repository of electronic
money operated via mobile phones (De Albuquerque
et al., 2016). Mobile money provides an integrated
platform that eases financial transactions in the form
of a one-stop center. In other words, given its ubiqui-
tous nature, mobile money facilitates transactions
over a wide range of sectors. Mobile money has been
extensively applied in many domains including, busi-
ness, finance, health, agriculture, and education. In
Uganda, telecom companies have partnered with
banks to synchronize both banking and mobile finan-
cial services. With continuous evolution, mobile
money facilitates financial transactions encompassing
mobile and bank account balance checks, deposits and
withdrawals, goods and service payments, purchase
of prepaid mobile phone credit, and money transfers
(Hughes and Lonie, 2007), and lately also features
bank transfers, savings groups, personal savings, and
access to credit (Gencer, 2011; Global System for
Mobile Communications, 2015).2 Information Development XX(X)A recent literature review shows that most mobile
payment adoption studies investigate adoption with a
specific theoretical background, such as the Technol-
ogy Acceptance Model (TAM); the Unified Theory of
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT); Task-
Technology Fit (TTF); the Theory of Reasoned
Action (TRA); the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) (Dahlberg et al.,
2015). The growing body of research surrounding the
drivers and constraints in adoption of mobile money
in developing countries encompasses: cost (Jack and
Suri, 2011); perceived ease of use and perceived use-
fulness (Etim, 2014; Tobbin, 2012); social network
effects (Kikulwe et al., 2014; Murendo et al., 2018;
Okello Candiya Bongomin et al., 2018); access to
formal banking institutions (Peruta, 2017); technol-
ogy anxiety (Lee and Warkentin, 2004) and complex-
ity, trial ability, age and gender (Faqih and Jaradat,
2015; Nyeko et al., 2014).
These studies notwithstanding, researchers have
not systematically studied the influence of skills on
adoption and use. Thus, there is good reason to study
how skills influence mobile money use. In line with
Dahlberg, Guo and Ondrus’s (2015) call to study
mobile technology adoption as a dynamically evol-
ving service in different contexts, Wyche and Stein-
field (2016) investigated, in a qualitative study, why
farmers in Kenya are not able to use cell phones. Their
study reveals barriers created by a lack of skills in the
use of mobile technology. The respondents in the
study were challenged by the phone functions such
as texting, and they were unable to comprehend the
English language used in the mobile phone menus.
Hence, in a developing country, basic skills and com-
petencies could be a significant predictor of mobile
money use.
Mobile money is used by literate, semi-literate and
illiterate persons, and is p articularly widespread
among people who cannot easily access financial ser-
vices in the formal sector (Donovan, 2012; Jack and
Suri, 2011; Kendall et al., 2012). This segment of the
population is characterized by low literacy levels
(Medhi et al., 2011). Previous research shows that
illiterate populations avoid complex functions, and
primarily use phones for making calls, because their
knowledge of the mobile phone is limited (Chipchase,
2005; Lippert and Forman, 2005). Furthermore, they
use a mobile phone with minimal reading and com-
prehension abilities of what they are doing (Wyche
and Steinfield, 2016). Their skill levels to efficiently
use a mobile phone are low. Skills refer to technicalknow-how to operate a given technology. Mobile
phone skills refer to the technical skills and know-
how to operate a mobile phone, for instance, texting,
comprehending texts, menu functions of a mobile
phone (Alampay and Bala, 2010; Wyche and Stein-
field, 2016). In addition, more technically related
skills are required within the application itself, such
as scrolling and hierarchical navigation, soft-key
mapping, numeric input, and understanding technical
language (Medhi et al., 2011). There is broad consen-
sus among scholars that technical know-how is an
important factor in the use of technology (Alampay
and Bala, 2010; Irura and Munjiru, 2013; Lippert and
Forman, 2005; Morawczynski, 2011).
To be able to use mobile money effectively, one
needs to be in a position to operate a mobile phone.
Mobile phone functions used for services such as
loading prepaid credit, subscribing to monthly data
or credit plans, checking credit balances, to mention
but a few, follow the same pattern as mobile money
functions. For example, in the context of mobile
money, a synchronized access code used across two
major mobile networks in Uganda is *165#. Once
input, this code processes the main set of mobile
money options, which will then provide a menu that
appears on the handset for subsequent selection of a
required mobile money service.
The mechanism behind using mobile money
requires the use of such codes and following sequen-
tial instructions to execute transactions. Hence, we
argue that having prior mobile phone skills will influ-
ence the extent to which an individual can use mobile
money. Prior experience with technologies has been
shown to promote use and adoption of mobile money
(Schierz et al., 2010; Wei and Zhang, 2008). For
example, Schierz et al. (2010), while studying indi-
vidual behavior patterns, found that prior experience
was instrumental in the adoption of mobile payment
systems in Germany. Prior experience gained from
using a mobile phone will enable a smoother transi-
tion into how to use mobile money. Correspond-
ingly, fully exploiting and effectively utilizing a
technology necessitates h aving the required skills
to operate a technology (Shen et al., 2010). Not only
will prior experience with a mobile phone enable
individuals to use mobile money, but it will also
provide opportunities to explore the more compli-
cated functionalities of the technology system
(Lippert and Forman, 2005).
In developing countries, where literacy levels are
rather low (Alampay and Bala, 2010; Medhi et al.,Kiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 32011), it is prudent to consider English literacy con-
straints in adoption of mobile financial technology.
Previous studies have argued and shown that low lit-
eracy users find it hard to complete tasks in the Eng-
lish based user-interfaces (Medhi et al., 2009, 2011).
Taking the case of M-PESA, in Kenya, some users not
fluent in English had difficulty reading text portions
of receipts from the mobile money transactions
though they could identify the numerical values
(Donovan, 2012). Further still, recent qualitative
research by Wyche and Steinfield (2016) found that
English menus embedded within the mobile money
application posed a barri er for illiterate users. Not
only did the language limit interactivity with the sys-
tem, but it also posed a blockade to accessing the
technology. The above literature underscores the
importance of both abilities and literacy in facilitating
the operation of the mobile money application.
Correspondingly, if one faces a barricade in using
mobile money due to English language barrier, the
attempt to explore various services offered will be
limited. We argue that individuals who can read Eng-
lish will be able to explore the variety of mobile
money services and therefore will be more likely to
use them. This reasoning follows from findings in
Wyche and Steinfield (2016) that depict that technol-
ogy based on the English language is difficult to oper-
ate for persons with low literacy. Furthermore, in their
study on the use of the internet, Lissitsa and
Chachashvili-Bolotin (2014) found that proficiency
in English facilitated variety of use of the Internet.
Research objectives
Dahlberg, Guo and Ondrus (2015) called for more
innovative context-specific constructs and approaches
into mobile payment research. In line with this call,
we add to the literature a new perspective on adoption
of mobile technology by highlighting the importance
of skills in the decision to use mobile money. In this
study, we also focus not only on the adoption decision
(whether one uses it or not) but also on what we term
variety of use of mobile money services. We define a
variety of use as the extent to which individuals
exploit the different functionalities of the mobile
money application. Previous studies exploring a vari-
ety of use in other domains, model this concept as a
complex behavior which involves higher cognitive
effort and points to the importance of studying this
notion more thoroughly (Leary et al., 2014; Shih and
Venkatesh, 2004). Nevertheless, what remainsunclear are the factors that hinder or support variety
of use of mobile money services.
Specifically, the research objectives for this study
are:
1. To examine the effect of mobile phone skills
and English proficiency on mobile money
adoption.
2. To assess the influence of mobile phone skills
and English proficiency on variety of use of
mobile money services.
Study hypotheses
H1- The higher the mobile phone skills an individual
possesses, the more likely that (s)he adopts mobile
money.
H2- The higher the mobile phone skills an individual
possesses, the larger the variety of mobile money ser-
vices (s)he will use.
H3- Having proficiency in English will positively influ-
ence adoption of mobile money.
H4- Proficiency in English will positively influence
variety of mobile money services use.
The remainder of the article is structured as fol-
lows. Following the methodology used in this study,
the results section is advanced by a discussion.
Finally, we present the implications arising from the
findings.
Methods
To test our hypotheses, we make use of data that was
collected via a survey in May 2015. Wakiso district
was purposively selected because it is the largest
district by population in Uganda. Wakiso has a pop-
ulation that is 13 %3higher than the capital city Kam-
pala, and it has a highly urbanized and accessible
population. Survey location was selected using a
multistage sampling pro cedure. In Uganda, urban
districts are divided into municipalities, divisions,
wards, and cells or sub-wards. Randomization was
used to select Entebbe out of the major administra-
tive units in Wakiso. Similarly, one division within
the selected municipality, one ward within the
selected division, and finally a list of sub-wards.
From this list, the first fiv e sub-wards were randomly
selected for the data collection (one can think of a
sub-ward as a village).
Within each of the five sub-wards, systematic
sampling of 50 households was done based on the4 Information Development XX(X)sub-ward’s population leading to a total of 250
sampled households. Based on the list of registered
households provided by the sub-ward’s local council
chairperson, the nth household was selected for an
interview. For instance, in Nakiwogo sub-ward that
had 576 registered households, every 11th household
(576/50) was selected for participation. Within each
household, one respondent was selected. Typically,
the person who opened the door was asked to par-
ticipate. If the person was under the age of 16, the
research assistant asked whether an adult was present.
In total, 47 of the 250 initially sampled households
refused or could not participate in the study. The
response rate was quite high (81.2 %). Some of
the reasons for non-cooperation were the fact that the
household head was not around and the potential par-
ticipant was not authorized to talk to strangers, a lack
of time on the respondent’s part, or being busy at the
moment of the interview. If a household was found to
have no individual to interview or a non-cooperative
individual, then the next-door household was consid-
ered for an interview.
The face-to-face interviews were conducted by six
trained Ugandan interviewers who visited partici-
pants’ homes and collected all information using the
Survey Gizmo tool (Survey Gizmo, 2006) on tablet
computers. The interviewers were selected and
trained for a day and a half in the use of the tablet
computers that were used to collect the responses,
the objectives of the data collection, and general
techniques for managing interviews. All inter-
viewers were MSc students who had previous expe-
rience with conducting social scientific research. At
the end of the data collection, a total of 249 inter-
views were finalized. Unfortunately, some inter-
views were lost because of a problem with
intermittent internet access. All in all, 41 surveys
were lost or not usable. The final number of valid
observations is 208.
Measures
The development of the survey included a back-and-
forth process with pre-testing of the questionnaire to
construct scales and evaluate whether or not items
were reliable and valid in the Ugandan context (pre-
tests were done on the street with mobile money users,
typically 10 users). Initially , self-perception scales
were developed to test for variables such as mobile
phone skills. However, they were prone to social
desirability. Therefore, the decision was made tofocus on abilities rather than self-perception. This
process took approximately two weeks. The instru-
ment was available in both English and the local lan-
guage, Luganda (the main spoken language in Central
Uganda) to ensure that questions were standardized
and not ambiguous.
Dependent variables
Mobile money adoption. Mobile money adoption is a
measurement of whether one uses or does not use the
technology. The variable Mobile Money Adoption is
a single item measure based upon the question “do
you currently use mobile money?” that was asked to
participants of the study, with the possible answers
being “yes” and “no”.
Variety of use of mobile money. Variety of use was mea-
sured based on the differe nt services available on
mobile money platforms in Uganda at the time of the
data collection. If respondents indicated that they used
mobile money, then they were subsequently asked
whether they used the following services: buy airtime
(“buying airtime” refers to the purchase of prepaid
mobile credit to make use of a cell phone); receive
money; send money; deposit / withdraw money, store
/ save money; pay for goods / receive payment for
goods; pay for bills, pay school fees; and transfer
money to/from a bank account.
Independent variables
Mobile phone skills. To test the participant’s actual
mobile phone skills, a 12-item scale was developed
based on the Actual Digita l Skills questionnaire
developed by the European Computer Driving
License (ECDL) in their 2009 report on digital lit-
eracy (ECDL, 2009). The instrument focuses on per-
sonal computer skills, and includes questions such as
“Which of the following is a portable storage
device?” and “Where would you click to attach a file
to an email?” The version developed for this study
focuses on mobile phone skills, with questions about
hardware functionality (“Which of these is most
likely failing if your phone loses power quickly?”)
and software related questions (“You want to send a
picture from your phone to a friend, which of these
systems does not allow you to do that?”). Questions
had varying degrees of difficulty. All items had five
possible options, one of which is correct. Participants
had the option to say they do not know the correct
answer (this option minimized guesswork). At the endKiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 5of the survey, all answers were recoded to ‘correct’ or
‘incorrect’.
English literacy. English literacy was measured using a
4-point Likert scale. Respondents’ were asked; “How
well can you read in English?” Response categories
were ‘Not at all, A little, Good, and, Very Good’.
Control variables. Several variables are included to con-
trol for possible confounding effects. These variables
were selected based on the existing literature on
mobile money adoption.
Mallat (2007) indicates that network externalities
can have a positive effect on the adoption of mobile
money services, depending on whether or not the
system is perceived as having enough users. The
existence of network externalities implies that when
more peers adopt mobile mo ney, the utility of adopt-
ing and using mobile money is increasing for an
individual as well.
Peer adoption. Ac o m m o ns u r v e ym e t h o di ns o c i a l
network research is the so-called name-generator
method (Marsden, 1990), which has been exten-
sively used in developing countries (for example,
Rooks, Klyver, and Sserwanga, 2016; Solano and
Rooks, 2018). In this method, respondents are asked
to list people with whom they interacted in a par-
ticular period. In this study, respondents were asked
‘Looking back over the last six months – who are
the people whom you have discussed important
matters with? Think of people in your family, in
your work, your friends, and so forth. It can be
anyone who you have talked recently and whose
opinion you consider to be important’. The inter-
viewer then noted names of these contacts. After
obtaining the list of names, the participant was
questioned about specific characteristics of each
contact he or she named. The variable network size
is the number of contacts mentioned in the name
generator.
A common practice when using name-generators is
the limitation of the maximum number of contacts, to
cope with time constraints in a survey while maintaining
measurement precision and minimizing measurement
bias (Sosa, 2011). For this study, the name-generator
was limited to a maximum of ten names.
For each contact mentioned in the name-generator,
we asked respondents ‘does [ contact name ]u s e
mobile money?’ Possible responses included, ‘yes;
no; and I don’t know’. Based on the informationgathered we calculated # peer adopters as the number
of contacts in a network of whom the respondent
knows that they use mobile money.
Demographic variables. Income influences have been
shown to sustain the use of mobile technology
(Crabbe et al., 2009). Mobile money is a financial
service, therefore users with a higher income are
expected to have a stronger need to use the system
a n di nm o r ev a r i e dw a y s .I n c o m ew a sm e a s u r e db y
asking the question “What is your current average
monthly income?” To control for social desirability
and provide for privacy, the participant was not
asked to provide the exact amount, but was given
the following categories: 0-100,000 UGX;
100,001-250,000 UGX; 250,001-500,000 UGX;
500,001-1,000,000 UGX; 1,000,001-2,000,000
UGX; >2,000,000 UGX. The exchange rate is 1
dollar to 3,629 Uganda shillings (UGX) using the
current exchange rate from Bank of Uganda4.
Finally, we included three other demographic vari-
ables in our analysis, Age, Gender, and whether one
has a bank account or not. We included them as con-
trol variables to test whether our hypotheses would
hold in the presence of these influences.
Results
Mokken scaling results
Variety of use of mobile money services. We tested the
scalability of the mobile money service items with
Mokken scale analysis, a non-parametric item-
response model (Gillespie et al., 1987). A Mokken
scale can be seen as a probabilistic version of Gutt-
man scaling (Van Schuur, 2003). Survey items of a
binary nature (yes or no items) form a Guttman scale
if the items can be arranged in a way that when an
answer to an item of a higher rank-order is one (or
yes), then answers to items of a lower rank-order are
likely to be one (or yes) as well. The resulting rank
order arranges the items from “functionalities that are
used by few users” to “functionalities that are used by
many users”. If these usage forms constitute a Mok-
ken scale, then users who pursue the more difficult
activities are probable to also pursue the easier activ-
ities. In our case, this implies that if the user transfers
money from/to a bank account”, which does not hap-
pen often, then this user will likely pay bills with
mobile money as well. The result of a Mokken scale
analysis is a hierarchy of use, which together consti-
tutes a scale, indicated by a measure of homogeneity6 Information Development XX(X)for the scale (H), a measure of fit for each item (Hi),
and reliability score ( r). In our Mokken scale analysis
one item, “send money”, had to be excluded, since it
was not scalable. In the final scale, the H coefficients
of all items are larger than .40, which is the standard
threshold for inclusion of items. The overall H-value
of the scale is 0.45, which suggests a medium-strong
scale. We checked whether model assumptions were
met and found no violation of the model assumptions.
All calculations were carried out using the software
MSPWIN version 5.0 (Molenaar and Sijtsma, 2000).
The variety of use variable thus consists of a score
ranging from zero (no adoption) to six (all six usage
forms are utilized).
Table 1 presents the result of the Mokken scaling
for a scale measuring variety of use of mobile
money.
Table 1 shows that receiving money is very com-
mon with 91 %of the participants. Many users treat
mobile money as a wallet, depositing money for a
short while (85 %). Buying airtime for mobile phone
use (pre-paid phone credit) is also common (73 %).
Less common are the functionalities to pay for goods
and bills (20 %and 29%respectively). Even less com-
mon is the use of mobile money for bank transfers
(6%). The final measure of variety of use is the sum of
the different services used for mobile money in
Uganda at the time of the data collection.
Mobile phone skills. Validity and reliability of the
instrument was once again checked using a Mokken
scale analysis (for an explanation of the Mokken
model see above). Test items 7, 2 and 11 were not
scalable, therefore were excluded. The mobile phone
skills variable thus consists of a score ranging from
zero (no skills) to nine (high skills). Table 2 presentsthe result of the Mokken scaling for mobile phone
skills. The final scale is strong and reliable with an
H-value of 0.50.
Table 2 shows that identification of a sim card,
hash and space buttons, as well as knowledge regard-
ing which part of a phone needs attention if it loses
power quickly, are the questions that were correctly
answered the most, with 96 %,9 4%,8 3%and 82%
respectively. Less known functionalities include what
a PUK code is, the use of iTunes and Google play,
Voicemail services, and knowledge on 3G technology
with 16 %,1 4%,9%and 2%respectively. Since the
test items “Battery”, “PUK code” and “3G Tech-
nology” were not scalable , we excluded these test
items. The final measure of mobile phone skills is the
sum of the different correct answers given by an indi-
vidual. The mobile phone skills variable thus
consists of a score ranging from zero (no skills) to
nine (high skills).
Descriptive statistics
Table 3 shows that 54 %of the respondents were
women and the average age of the respondents is 36
years. The average monthly income is 326,322 Ugan-
dan shillings which are approximately 90 United
States dollars at the current exchange rate. (1 dollar
to 3,629 Uganda shillings) On average, respondents
know 50 %of the functionalities on their phones, and
84%of the respondents use mobile money. Those that
adopted mobile money use, on average, 50 %of theTable 1. Results of Mokken scaling for variety of mobile

read English with an above average number of 11
years spent at school. The average number of contacts
per respondent is 5. Further, within an individual’s
network, about 4 people on average use mobile
money, and 51 %of the sample have a bank account.
Table 4 shows that adoption of mobile money and
variety of use have the same correlates. Therefore, an
increase in mobile phone skills, English literacy,
number of peer adopters, education, and having a
bank account may influence an increase in mobile
money adoption and variety of use.
These preliminary findings indicate a state of
inequality in access and use of mobile money
technology. The younger generation, individuals whoare more educated, those with access to formal financial
institutions (banks) and the male gender are in an advan-
taged position to utilize the mobile money technology.
Also, we observed high correlations, particularly
between English literacy and Education in number of
years spent in school (0.70), prompting the testing for
multicollinearity among independent variables in our
subsequent analyses. The Variance Inflation Factors
were all /C202.50 with a mean-variance inflation factor
of 1.72, indicating the absence of multicollinearity.

predictors (English literacy and mobile phone skills),
indicate that mobile phone skills are the only signif-
icant predictor of the two. ( b¼0.75 [4.10], p <
0.001). Model 3 includes both predictors, and it sup-
ports the above finding. Therefore, we conclude that
whereas hypothesis 1 is supported, hypothesis 3 is not
supported by our data.
Based on a model with only the significant predic-
tors of mobile money adoption (namely; mobile
phone skills, number of peer adopters and network
size), we estimated the probability that a person with
a certain level of mobile phone skills will adopt
mobile money. In order to do this, we use 10 cases,
where the mobile phone skill levels are varied based
on the Mokken scale analysis reported earlier (0 - 9),
and the number of adopters and network size is held at
the sample mean of four (4) and five (5) respectively.
The predictive probabilities in Figure 1 show that
the difference between a person who has zero skills
and a person with low skills (0 vs 3) is almost 49
percentage points (0.74- 0.25). Compare this to the
difference between medium-skilled and low skilled
respondents (3 vs 6) of 20 %(0.96- 0.74). This indi-
cates that helping individuals at the beginning of
mobile phone acquisition to acquire basic (low skills)
such as, ‘what do the buttons on your phone repre-
sent’; ‘where to locate the hash button on your phone’,
can have a drastic effect on the use of mobile-based
applications, an effect that is larger than helping low
skilled persons achieve a medium-skilled level.
Increasing a medium level of mobile phone skills toa higher level does not seem to have much relevance
to the adoption of mobile money, as seen by the low
increment in probabilities of adoption (0.96 to 0.99).
Variety of mobile money use analysis
The linear regression results predicting the variety of
use of mobile money are presented in Table 6. Dis-
tinctions between the explained variance of each of
the two main predictors are shown in Models 4 and 5,
similar to the results in Table 5. Model 6, which con-
tains all the constructs, shows that neither mobile
phone skills nor English literacy predicts the variety
of use of mobile money, ( b¼0.08, t¼1.46, p >0.05);
(b¼0.15, t¼1.30, p >0.05) therefore H2 and H4 are
not supported by the data.
Furthermore, model 6 shows that the number of
peer adopters in an individual’s network positively
influences variety of use, ( b¼0.13, t ¼2.37,
p<0.05). Hence, the higher the number of contacts
an individual has that use mobile money, the more
likely that the person will also use many services of
the mobile money platform. Mobile phones are
mainly used among one’s network, and therefore, it
is not surprising that mobile money transactions too,
seem to rotate within individual networks. Not only
do networks present occasions to learn about mobile
money services, but also provide opportunities to exe-
cute various transactions because you possess a net-
work that understands and uses the technology.

fold. First, we analyze skills as determinants of the
adoption of mobile financial technology, consistent
with earlier suggestions in the literature. Secondly,
we extend existing studies by also investigating deter-
minants of variety of use. Thus, we not only focus on
the adoption decision in isolation but also study how
people use it.
Our results show that mobile phone skills are
indeed an essential driver in the adoption of mobile
financial technology in Uganda, whereas theimportance of English language skills is much smaller
or non-existing. These results could be pertinent to
Ugandan policymakers and other developing econo-
mies faced with the dilemma of low adoption rates of
mobile money. Through providing a basis to create
relevant solutions tailored to improving mobile phone
skills, the uptake of mobile money services can be
improved. The results also show that it is pertinent
to include users and their capabilities in the develop-
ment of mobile technology services (Dahlberg, Guo
and Ondrus, 2015).

Discussion
This article advances research on adoption and use of
mobile phone applications in developing countries by
focusing on skills of individuals, specifically mobile
phone skills and English literacy. We argued that
skills will affect adoption and use in two ways,
namely; [1] the higher the mobile phone skills an
individual has, the more likely the individual will
adopt and subsequently make use of the various ser-
vices offered by mobile money; [2] the higher the
English language profici ency of an individual, the
more likely s(he) will adopt mobile money and use
more services offered by the technology.
The findings corroborate that individuals who are
skilled at using a mobile phone will find it easier to
operate the mobile money technology, more so in
developing economies where the ubiquity of mobile
phones is rising (De Albuquerque et al., 2016), and
illiteracy levels are still high (Gebremichael and Jack-
son, 2006; Global System for Mobile Communica-
tions, 2016a; Matotay and Furuholt, 2010; West,
2012). Thus, skills are an important consideration in
use of mobile financial technology products. There is
a need for policymakers to enhance skills and subse-
quently adoption and usability of the technology for
financial inclusion.
This study is the first to systematically demonstrate
the importance of basic mobile phone skills in the use
of mobile financial services in a developing country.
Our results provide an empirical corroboration of pre-
vious non-empirical speculation of the importance of
skills in technology adop tion (Alampay and Bala,
2010; Donovan, 2012; Medhi et al., 2009; Tobbin,
2012; Wyche and Steinfield, 2016). Though the above
studies provided a platform on which this study is
based, our study is different from the above studies
as we develop a measurem ent scale to test actual
mobile phone skills and consider these in relation toactual usage of mobile money services in a develop-
ing country context.
Findings show that though mobile phone skills are
important for initial adoption, they are not relevant for
the subsequent use of other services over the same
platform. Mobile money transactions follow an iden-
tical format; therefore if an individual learns to carry
out one transaction, it is highly likely that transfer
learning will occur and one can follow sequential
instructions to execute other transactions. This could
explain why mobile phone skills are not crucial for
variety of use.
Rather surprisingly, English language proficiency
showed a positive trend though not significant for the
adoption of mobile money. Mobile money is a pre-
dominantly English- based platform. Therefore, it was
expected that persons endowed with more skills
regarding English literacy would be better-suited to
use this particular technology. However, our findings
show that this is not the case.
Our analysis suggests an explanation of this result.
Further quantitative analysis using the covariates,
specifically, social influence reveals that individuals
can execute transactions possibly through social net-
works which provide tech-support regarding aware-
ness, information provision, and actual hands-on
facilitation. Murendo et al. (2018) confirmed the
above reasoning. In other words, relatives, friends,
and acquaintances of less tech-savvy mobile money
users assist them to use mobile money, either using it
on their behalf (proxy use) or through teaching them
how to use it. The above phenomenon could explain
why English proficiency might not be a requirement
to use mobile money.
Anecdotal evidence from previously mentioned
studies (Donovan, 2012; Medhi et al., 2009) and our
fieldwork (informal qualitative inquiry carried out
after the interviews), further support the above find-
ings. This anecdotal evidence showed that illiterate
individuals find mobile technology solutions through
constant repetition, trial and error and not necessarily
through understanding the underlying dynamics. For
example, individuals may have the ability to complete
a transaction, but may lack the capacity to compre-
hend the confirmation message received thereafter
from the service providers (Wyche and Steinfield,
2016). Similarly, the use of mobile money agents as
intermediaries in the transaction process facilitates
low literate users to carry out transactions.
Notwithstanding the above social support, mobile
money is a financial tool where access is by “secretKiconco et al: A skills perspective on the adoption and use of mobile money services in Uganda 11codes” commonly referred to as PIN (Personal Iden-
tification Numbers) codes. Therefore, the risk of fraud
arising from third party assistance and support
through proxy use is imminent. Thus, it is pertinent
that individuals can operate the technology on their
own. Arguably, skills can be derived from social net-
works (Cross and Cummings, 2004; Kikulwe et al.,
2014; Kreindler and Young, 2014; Murendo et al.,
2018) and future studies being undertaken by the
researchers will shed more light on the mechanisms
through which individuals acquire mobile money
skills through their social networks.
This article has some limitations. The study was
cross-sectional and beca use it was constrained by
resources, it focused on an urban sample. The urban
sample depicted an above average level of literacy,
though this could explain the irrelevancy of English
literacy in explaining adoption and use in this study. It
would be more enriching if a rural sample where illit-
eracy largely affects the population segment was used
to investigate further the effect of skills on the use of
mobile money. Future research should look into the
dynamics of skills and their role in technology use
between these two different settings.
In addition, to use mobile money, one needs mobile
money skills. These are the direct skills to use the
technology. However, to acquire these skills, an indi-
vidual needs to know how to operate a mobile phone.
In this study, we used mobile phone skills as a pre-
cursor to using mobile money. It would be prudent to
test and measure mobile money skills and further
examine whether these two skills are different from
one another. Future research could focus on exploring
the differences and effects of these two skills on the
use of mobile money technology.
Implications
Skills are an integral part of the adoption process of
mobile financial technology
The practical implications emerging from our study
indicate the need for policymakers to promote skills
and literacy for the adoption and use of technology.
We live in a digital world, and the inequality in who
can access and use digital technology is wider in
developing economies (Aron, 2015; Wei and Zhang,
2008). With clear evidence from this study, the indi-
viduals with access to skills, literacy, and income are
in advantaged position for the adoption of mobile
money. Though these indicator constructs are posi-
tive, this status quo defeats the original purpose of themobile money innovation, which was to include the
“poorest of the poor” in the financial circle. It is thus
of vital importance to mitigate the causes of this
inequality and find solutions to reduce this divide.
Target specific technology needs of users through
assessing their skill levels
With the surging move to use of technology in the
financial domain, financial education and literacy
have received consensus as instruments to enable the
poor better understand and u tilize financial products
such as mobile money (Carpena et al., 2015). How-
ever, at the root of the problem is not the intention or
structure of the education c ampaigns, but the failure
to observe the cause of ineffectiveness in the educa-
tion programs (Kaiser and Menkhoff, 2017). This
study sheds light on one of the sources of ineffective
education campaigns. The lack of prior skills. “A
teachable moment” as described by Miller et al.
(2015) can be adopted by assessing skill levels of
individuals, determined using the measurement scale
developed in studies such as this, to assess cognitive
limitations and give contextualized and relevant
training that maximizes the behavioral change in a
target group.
Change-agents through social networks
Additionally, policymakers should initiate and foster
social network activities in various population seg-
ments in order to create focus groups for mobile
money adoption and diffusion. They also could iden-
tify opinion leaders who could then act as change
agents in smaller communities. Future research can
build on our findings by elaborating the network per-
spective and applying other perspectives that take into
account the effects of social influences and the
broader social context for explaining the adoption of
mobile money and other important innovations. Also,
similar research needs to be repeated in other African
countries to find out whether network characteristics
matter there as well.
The need for usability studies on mobile
financial technology
In respect of financial inclusion technology products
and service providers and the wider technology com-
munity, the findings provide information on user
behavior in developing economies. Debatably, there
is a general impression that attitudes towards using12 Information Development XX(X)technology are stimulated by numerous factors. How-
ever, this study clearly shows that in developing coun-
tries, adoption and continued use of technology is
mainly a function of requisite skills to operate the
technology. As these mobile technology solutions
advance, systems and services providers should con-
sider not only the additional value of their technology
but also how practical it is for an individual to use.
Usability studies should be a prudent requirement for
release of new technology to the market more so in
emerging countries.

Cyber securityGenderABSTRACT
Smartphones have diffused rapidly across South African society and constitute the most dominant information
and communication technologies in everyday use. That being so, it is important to ensure that all South Africansknow how to secure their smart devices. Doing so requires a high level of security awareness and knowledge. Asyet, there is no formal curriculum addressing cyber security in South African schools. Indeed, it seems to be left to
universities to teach cyber security principles, and they currently only do this when students take computing-
related courses. The outcome of this approach is that only a very small percentage of South Africans, i.e. thosewho take computing courses at university, are made aware of cyber security risks and know how to take pre-
cautions. In this paper we found that, because this group is overwhelmingly male, this educational strategy
disproportionately leaves young South African women vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We thus contend that cybersecurity ought to be taught as children learn the essential “3R s”—delivering requisite skills at University level
does not adequately prepare young South Africans for a world where cyber security is an essential skill. Starting to
provide awareness and knowledge at primary school, and embedding it across the curriculum would, in additionto ensuring that people have the skills when they need them, also remove the current gender imbalance in cybersecurity awareness.
1. Introduction
In 1818, The Lady's Magazine included an article on “The Three R's ”
(reading, writing and arithmetic) ( Percy and Timbs, 2019 ). Schools today
still teach these foundational skills but also teach many more ( Nias et al.,
2005 ). Towards the end of the 20thcentury, information and communi-
cation technologies (ICTs) started to pervade daily lives, such that ICTs
have now become an infrastructural essential on a par with electricity
and water ( Carr, 2003 ). In addition to the three R's, schools and higher
education increasingly also teach ICT skills to children from a very young
age. The United Kingdom (UK), for example, proposes curricula for early
education to include Information and Communications Technology as a
foundational skill ( Education and Training Foundation, 2019 ). There are
also moves to ensure that children are taught about online safety (Sutton,
2011 ) and how to spot fake news ( Cockburn, 2019 ).
ICT use is now intertwined with Internet use. It then follows that
anyone using the Internet, whatever their age, also needs to know how tosecure their devices because forewarned is forearmed ( Renaud et al.,
2016 ). Safety and security are semantically different concepts ( Waldron,
2006 ) requiring different kinds of knowledge and skill sets. Smartphone
users, of all ages, should know that their phones are vulnerable to attack,
and also know how to improve device security. Because education is at
the heart of security awareness and capability ( Siponen, 2001 ), it is
imperative for cyber security education to reach all of society and all
ages.
Cyber security education has two elements: ﬁrst people need to
become aware of the need to take precautions, and then teachers need to
impart the skills they require to take the required precautions. We plan to
assess awareness, as an essential prerequisite to mastering cyber security
skills. We focus on assessing levels of cyber security awareness of uni-
versity students in South Africa, as developing country citizens i.e. the“outcome ”of the wider South African cyber security educational
approach. Moreover, we explore whether the extant awareness levels
exhibit the same gender imbalance as that evidenced in other societal

murindi and Louw, 2010 ).
We chose to focus on smartphone cyber security in South Africa, for
three reasons:
/C15Theﬁrst is that cyber-attacks increase year on year ( Fowler, 2016 ),
and developing countries are not exempt ( Olapido, 2015 ). Cyber
criminals, ﬁnding that large organisations are getting better at cyber
security and are therefore becoming more dif ﬁcult to compromise,
have now turned their attention to easier targets: small businesses and
home computer users ( Krebs, 2017 ), both of whom do a great deal of
their computing on their smartphones ( Asadullah Khaskheli and
Bhuiyan, 2017 ).
/C15The second reason is that smartphone ownership is increasing glob-
ally, offering an attractive attack surface that hackers can use to target
the unwary or unprotected ( Mayer, 2014 ). Smartphone adoption has
increased beyond expectations but, unfortunately, so have security
vulnerabilities. A lack of education and awareness is contributing to
the growing cyber-security problem ( Hanus and Wu, 2016 ). South
African smartphone ownership was 51% in 2018 ( Pew Research
Centre, 2018 ), which is higher than global computer ownership
(Newzoo, 2017 ), meaning that South Africans might be even more
vulnerable to smartphone-enabled attacks than citizens of other
countries.
/C15The third reason is that South African children own and use smart-
phones at increasing rates. Businesstech reported that 80% of sec-ondary South African school pupils owned a smartphone in 2017
(Businesstech, 2019 ), and Porter (2016) reported that 51% of primary
South African school pupils owned mobile phones. Because South
African adolescents and youth are the ﬁrst adopters of new mobile
technologies ( Beger and Sinha, 2012 ) and South African University
students are heavy users of smartphones ( North et al., 2014 ), we
cannot wait until adulthood to raise awareness of security issues and
ensure that people have the requisite security-related skills.
South African schools and universities are starting to incorporate
cyber security into many of their educational programmes ( Kortjan and
von Solms, 2014 ;von Solms and von Solms, 2014 ). According to Dlamini
&Modise, the South African government is investing in cyber security
efforts to help improve cyber resilience ( Dlamini and Modise, 2013 ).
However, there does not seem to be a formal across-the-board curriculum
for cyber security ( De Lange and von Solms, 2012 ). It cannot be assumed
that all South Africans ’awareness of cyber security issues is being
improved by these efforts. Any educational endeavour needs routinely to
assess its impact, so that interventions can be re ﬁned and improved and
made as effective as possible. We thus assess the impact of the South
African approach to raising cyber security awareness.
The main contribution of this paper is to:
1. emphasize the need to treat cyber security (and not merely ICT) as a
foundational skill, alongside other basic skills throughout the
educational system —together with the basic “three R's ”.
2. highlight the impact of the current South African approach to cyber
security education i.e. rendering young women more vulnerable to
cyber-attacks, and thereby exacerbating the gender imbalance in
South African society.
We consider related research in Section 2before explaining our
research methodology in Section 3. Section 4presents our results, with
Section 5discussing and re ﬂecting on them. Section 6concludes.
2. Related research
The world is on the brink of a new revolution: the Fourth Industrial
Revolution. According to the World Economic Forum ( World Economic
Forum, 2017a ), this new technological revolution will fundamentallychange the way people live and work. This change, if not embraced and
anticipated, could minimize, or even derail, the potential it has for
development and innovation in developing countries.
According to ITU, Internet users (worldwide) increased from 1991
million in 2010 –3385 million in 2016 ( ITU, 2018a ). Among these users,
young people (aged 15 –24) are the most prominent users (71%), a high
number given that only 48% of the total world population uses the
Internet.
2.1. Regional differences
As shown in Figure 1 , there is a distinct within-country digital divide
in Africa.
In developing countries, the Internet is accessed mostly via mobile
phones ( Statista, 2019 ). As many as 81% of South African households in
metropolitan areas only use mobile phones at home (see Figure 2 ).
Although Internet usage increased from 30% of the world's population in
2010 to 47% of the world's population in 2016 ( ITU, 2018b ), in Africa
only 25% of the African population used the Internet in 2016. In
November 2018 the average cost of 1GB of mobile data in South Africa
was $7.19. Cable.co.uk1places South Africa 143 out of 230 countries in
terms of its mobile data cost. The most expensive country was Zimbabwe
(with an average of $75.20 per GB) and the cheapest was India (with an
average of $0.26 per GB).
A high proportion of South Africans only access the Internet at places
where they can access free Wi-Fi because data costs in South Africa
(compared to other BRICS countries) are prohibitive (see Figure 3 ).
Chigona et al. indicated, in an article about people living in disadvan-
taged communities in the Western Cape, that they visited libraries with
Wi-Fi access at least once a week and primarily used this library service to
do research and access social media sites ( Chigona et al., 2016 ).
2.2. Gender differences in Science, Technology, Engineering or
Mathematics
According to the World Bank report, the Internet usage gender gap in
Africa has increased since 2013, and not decreased as in other regions
(The World Bank, 2016 ).
Theﬁrst step in moving towards gender equality is to ﬁnd areas
where such inequality is occurring. Only then can targeted efforts be
made to address and reduce inequalities. It is clear that women, espe-
cially young girls, still face inequalities in terms of computer and Internet
access ( The World Bank, 2016 )(Livingston et al., 2017 ), as demonstrated
inTable 1 . It is interesting to note that the only place where the pro-
portion of women using the Internet is greater than that of men ( ITU,
2018b ) is in the Americas.
Women who study at tertiary institutions, in both advanced and
developing countries, are less likely than men to choose a career in Sci-
ence, Technology, Engineering or Mathematics (STEM) and are paid less
than their male counterparts in the same positions once they qualify. In
the United States, less than 25% of STEM positions are ﬁlled by women
and, for every dollar a man earns in this ﬁeld, a woman earns only 86
cents ( Beede et al., 2011 ). The majority of women with a STEM degree
(56%) prefer to work either in education or health care ( UNESCO Edu-
cation Sector, 2017 ). In 2017, a report by the United Nations Educational
Scienti ﬁc and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) reported that only 35% of
students graduating world-wide in STEM ﬁelds are women ( UNESCO
Education Sector, 2017 ).
It is important to create opportunities for women to “increase the
pipeline ”of potential employees in the technology industry. Currently,
only 16% of graduates in computer science in the United States (US) are
women, with only 18% ﬁlling “tech roles ”in Silicon Valley ( World Eco-
nomic Forum, 2017b ). It is estimated by Girls Who Code (WCD) (a
1https://www.cable.co.uk/mobiles/worldwide-data-pricing/ .I.M. Venter et al. Heliyon 5 (2019) e02855
2non-pro ﬁt organisation that raises interest in technology sector careers)
that women will hold only 3% of “tech jobs ”in the US by 2020 ( World
Economic Forum, 2017b ). In sub-Saharan Africa, the digital gender
divide is even more pronounced, with fewer women than men
completing tertiary education, owning a cell phone or accessing the
Internet ( Alozie and Akpan-Obong, 2017 ).According to the World Bank report, a gender gap exists at home and
in the educational system even before girls enter university —with only

35% of 15-year-old girls (compared to 18 percent of boys) in Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) economies
considering a career in STEM ( Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, 2009 ). It is important to address gender
stereo-typing early on, and to encourage girls to believe that they are able
to excel in this ﬁeld and to provide incentives for recruitment and the
graduation of women in these ﬁelds. It is also important that the work
environment be gender-friendly ( The World Bank, 2016 ;European
Platform of Women Scientists, 2016 ).
It is appropriate to pause for a moment to offer a disclaimer on how
the authors used the concept of “gender ”in this paper. While the authors
acknowledge a far wider spectrum of gender identities than the “male/
female ”and“men/women ”binary used here, we take a feminist socio-
logical stance in focusing on how the status quo has disadvantaged
women (self-identi ﬁed) in order to reveal power imbalances. This
research is in conversation with the broader quantitative data sets that
are based upon gender binaries, particularly those that highlight wom-
en's historical exclusion from the technology sector, leading to their
vulnerability in tech related domains ( Wajcman, 2010 ). Moreover,
women are more likely to be victims of a range of cybercrimes ( Marcum
et al., 2014 ;Asadullah Khaskheli and Bhuiyan, 2017 ;Bates, 2017 ), so
research into their cyber resilience cannot be neglected.
2.3. Related research on cyber security education
Students are heavy users of technologies but they do not necessarily
receive formal cybersecurity training ( Bennett and Maton, 2010 ;Bennett
et al., 2008 ). In South Africa, the curriculum makes provision for life
skills“…comprising Beginning Knowledge, Creative Arts, Physical Education
and Personal and Social Wellbeing ”(Department of Basic Education, South
Africa, 2015 , p. 8) from Grade R (before school) to Grade 3 however the
time allocated to this per week is only 6 hours(for Grade R to 3) and then
changes to 4 hours for Grades 4 –6. Life Orientation is taught from Grades
7 to 12 for 2 hours per week ( Department of Basic Education, South
Africa, 2015 ). In the Life Orientation curriculum, no speci ﬁc mention is
made of cyber security ( Department of Education, 2003 ).
2.4. Gender differences in cyber security
Anwar et al. ( Anwar et al., 2017 ) surveyed 481 company employees
to explore their cybersecurity beliefs and behaviours. They report that
women reported signi ﬁcantly lower levels of security self-ef ﬁcacy,
whereas Gratian et al. (2018) reported that women were more likely to
delay software updates and choose weaker passwords ( Gratian et al.,
2018 ).Cain et al. (2018) also revealed that women had lower security
knowledge than males in their study ( Cain et al., 2018 ).Halevi et al.
(2017) report that the women in their study had a lower sense of
self-ef ﬁcacy when it came to cyber security ( Halevi et al., 2017 ). Anwar
et al. recommended that gender sensitive training and intervention
programs be designed for cybersecurity awareness ( Anwar et al., 2017 ).This is con ﬁrmed by the outcome of a security awareness drive in a
secondary school which also detected gender differences ( Jin et al.,
2018 ).
However, Chaudhary et al. (2015) study found equal levels of
cybersecurity knowledge in their participants, who were all computer
science, software engineering or related degree students ( Chaudhary
et al., 2015 ).Halevi et al. (2017) also discovered a signi ﬁcant impact of a
Computer Science degree on cyber security self ef ﬁcacy ( Halevi et al.,
2017 ). This suggests that gender differences might well have more to do
with the gender imbalance in these degree programmes than any other
gender-related differences. This is con ﬁrmed by Ismailova and Muha-
metjanova (2016) study ( Ismailova and Muhametjanova, 2016 ).
2.5. Summary
This review demonstrates that women tend not to do computing-
related degree programmes and courses. Because most cyber security
awareness training occurs within these degree programmes, they will not
be exposed to these principles as part of their university education. This,
then, means that they feel less aware of cyber security issues, as a de-
mographic. The studies we cite above were carried out in other parts of
the world. Here we investigate the state of play in South Africa, as a
developing country.
In particular, we want to answer two questions:
RQ1: Is there a difference in cyber security awareness between stu-
dents doing a computing-related degree and those doing a different
kind of degree?
RQ2: Are there gender differences with respect to (1)?
3. Research methodology
3.1. Student project
To explore students ’smartphone security and privacy knowledge, the
2016 and 2017 cohort of third year computer science students doing acompulsory Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course at the University
of the Western Cape (UWC) in Cape Town were tasked to be researchers.
The students were instructed, as a research project, to envisage being
employed by a large smartphone company. The company wanted to
determine whether smartphone users were aware of smartphone security
and privacy issues. We asked the student team to carry out a small
research project the better to understand users ’security- and privacy-
related smartphone experiences. Their ﬁctional company employer “ex-
pected ”the team to write a report based on their ﬁndings. In particular,
the students were instructed to situate their ﬁndings within the current
literature and then make suggestions on how the company should design
the phone interface in order to improve awareness of security and privacy
issues.
Each student team member was asked to ﬁnd two smartphone owners
(older than 18 years and not in their class) to interview. One should not
have studied computer science or a related subject and the other had
previously or currently studied computer science. They were instructedto conduct an interview with their participants, using a prede ﬁned
questionnaire consisting of 65 questions. For the rest of this report, all
participants in the former category will be referred to as: non-Computer
Science (NCS) and the latter as Computer Science (CS) participants.
To train students in carrying out ethical research, they were instruc-
ted to ask the potential participant for their consent to be interviewed
and to sign a form to con ﬁrm that: (1) the participant had read and un-
derstood the purpose of the questionnaire; (2) he or she was free to
withdraw their participation without providing reasons; (3) he or she
would not provide any security-related information to the interviewer
andﬁnally (4) granted permission for the information they provided to
be used for research purposes (including reports, publications andTable 1. Internet penetration in 2017 by gender ( ITU, 2018b ).

4presentations) with strict preservation of anonymity. Ethical clearance
for this research was obtained from the university's research committee.
The aim of the student research project was not only to train students
in ethical research but also to make the student researchers themselves
more aware of security and privacy issues —the majority of whom are
also smartphone owners. Furthermore, since the research was team-
based, students also learned how to function within a team and, by
implication, how to collaborate, organise team meetings and write a team
report.
The data the student teams collected over the 2016 –2017 period was
combined to answer the following research questions: (1) does a com-
puter science speci ﬁc education improve cyber resilience, and (2) are
there gender differences with respect to (1)?
Quantitative analysis using SAS ®(SAS Institute Inc, 2017 ) was car-
ried out on the data set and also on the following groupings: gender and
CS background. The open-ended questions provided additional infor-
mation that was post-coded and analysed quantitatively.
4. Results
4.1. Descriptive background
In 2016, the student researchers interviewed 100 students (51 CS and
49 NCS students) and in 2017, 152 students (76 CS and 76 NCS) were
interviewed. The total number of observations is thus 252.
Forty-one percent of the participants were women —24% of the CS
participants and 57% of NCS participants. Most completed their school-
leaving certi ﬁcates in cities (61%) with 39% completing their
schooling in small towns or rural areas. On average, the participants had
been using smartphones for 5.3 years in the 2016 cohort, and 6.6 years in
the 2017 cohort (minimum 0 and maximum 20 years). Most (77%) al-
ways kept their mobile phones within reach.
Signiﬁcantly more men than women took CS as a subject (Chi-sq ¼
28.06, P <0.0001). This was true for both 2016 and 2017 cohorts, and
has been the case for several years now at UWC. This tendency was also
experienced at another university in South Africa where the number of
women students studying towards a degree in IT dropped from 58 in
2000 to 14 in 2012 ( Pretorius et al., 2015 ).
4.2. Gender as well as CS exposure
When considering gender, as well as CS background separately, it was
found that signi ﬁcantly more of the CS-men (78%) versus all others (CS-
women 65%, NCS-women 58% and NCS-men 55%) felt that there were
security/privacy issues when using PayPal for payments (Chi-sq ¼19.1, p
¼0.0040). Signi ﬁcantly fewer NCS-men felt that there was no security
risk when using online shopping (Chi-sq ¼13.6, p ¼0.0346) (see
Table 2 ).
More of the CS students (CS-men 48% and the CS-women 42%), when
compared to the NCS-students (NCS-women 27% and NCS-men 25%)
were aware of privacy/security risks when using BitTorrent (Chi-sq ¼
29.88, p <0.0001). It was found that more of the CS students (CS-men
39% and the CS-women 43%) when compared to the NCS students (NCS-
women 24% and NCS-men 27%) were aware of privacy/security risks
when using Bitcoin (Chi-sq ¼22.37, p ¼0.0010).
When considering gender, as well as CS background, it was found that
more of the CS students (CS-men 51% and the CS-women 62%), as
compared to the NCS students (NCS-women 27% and NCS-men 37%)
understood what “encryption ”meant (Chi-sq ¼25.651, p ¼0.0003) (see
Table 3 ). Furthermore, it was found that more of the CS students (CS-men
64% and the CS-women 55%), as compared to the NCS students (NCS-
women 37% and NCS-men 33%), knew how to identify phishing at-
tempts (Chi-sq ¼18.18, p ¼0.0004).
It seems as if the majority of the CS-men and some of the CS-women
ﬁndsecurity advice on the Internet whereas the NCS-women tend to get the
advice by word of mouth . Both groups use the Internet, word of mouth,public media and combinations thereof to get security advice (see
Figure 4 ).
Apart from using a PIN (Personal Identi ﬁcation Number) or password,
students were in general not concerned about security around friends or
family. Most of the students were quite happy to share their passwords
with family or friends. More of the women —NCS-women (81%) and CS-
women (71%)) —compared to the men —NCS-men (59%) and CS-men
(65%) —did so and only a few regretted it (see Table 4 ).
There seems to be very little difference between the device behav-
iours of the different groups (see Table 5 ). However, slightly more
women kept records of their Phone's IMEI (International MobileTable 2. Respondent's perceived mobile phone security or privacy issues.

anti-virus software on their phones. More of the CS students (CS-men
47% and the CS-women 45%), as compared to the NCS students (NCS-
women 23% and NCS-men 36%), knew how to lock or wipe their phoneswhen lost or stolen (Chi-sq ¼13.7, p ¼0.0335). More of the men and CS-
women (CS men 81%, NCS-men 74% and the CS-women 71%), as
compared to the NCS-women (NCS-women 59%), took action when
selling or giving their phones away (Chi-sq ¼10.0, p ¼0.0186). More of
the CS-women (71%), as compared to the rest (NCS-women 35%, CS-men
53% and NCS-men 53%), regularly backed up the data on their phones
(Chi-sq ¼12.2, p ¼0.0067).
Very few of the smartphone users offered security advice to fellow
users (see Table 6 ). However signi ﬁcantly more of the CS students (CS-
men 38% and the CS-women 35%), as compared to the NCS students
(NCS-women 17% and NCS-men 15%), offered security advice to other
smartphone users (Chi-sq ¼21.1, p ¼0.0018).
Some of the students knew that they could be held liable for tweets
even if it did not originate from them. More men seemed to make friends
online than women. However, when combining the CS and NCS groups,
signiﬁcantly more of the men (76%), as compared to women (56%),
reported having made a friend online (Chi-sq ¼11.45, p ¼0.0095).
In the next section the data will be discussed in terms of how it an-
swers the research questions.
5. Discussion
Theﬁrst research question posed was (RQ1) Is there a difference in
cyber security awareness between students doing a computing-related degree
and those doing a different kind of degree? It is clear that a computer science
education does indeed improve awareness of smartphone security and
privacy issues, and precautions to be taken. Table 3 demonstrates a clear
positive impact of a computing science education in this respect. More of
the CS students understood the risks of BitTorrent and Bitcoin, under-
stood the term “encryption ”, and felt able to identify phishing messages.
The majority of the CS-men, and some of the CS-women, found security
advice on the Internet and tended to offer security advice to other
smartphone users.
The second question posed was (RQ2) Are there gender differences? The
CS-women were more resilient than all students (men and women) doing
NCS degrees, demonstrating the value of a CS education, regardless of
gender. Indeed, the general awareness trends shown in Table 2 demon-
strate a clear difference between CS (left two columns) and NCS students
(right two columns) across the board. It is interesting to note that more of
the CS-women regularly made backups of the data on their phones,perhaps because they perceive that they are easier targets for theft?
Suggestions for future research could include a more qualitative
approach and doing in-depth interviews to uncover reasons. Further-
more, fewer women reported having made a friend online. This could be

6because of women's heightened sense of vulnerability. Yet, as demon-
strated earlier, being content with this situation is not an option. The fact
that fewer women do computing subjects at school, and that fewer
women study CS at university ( van Broekhuizen and Spaull, 2017 )
effectively leads to the situation where fewer women bene ﬁt from
heightened cyber security awareness.
It does seem as if a CS education improves awareness, and it does so
for both genders. This con ﬁrmsﬁndings by Darkish et al. that students
with a technology or science background were less vulnerable to phish-
ing attacks ( Darkish et al., 2012 ). Moreover, Gratian et al. found that
university students (aged 18 –25) and students majoring in the human-
ities would bene ﬁt from security training ( Gratian et al., 2018 ).
The discouraging conclusion is that upcoming generations of South
Africans who do not study CS will have insuf ﬁcient awareness of privacy
and security issues, and will, as a consequence, be more vulnerable to
cyber-attacks. Moreover, women will be disproportionately affected. The
South African educational system can no longer leave it to Universities to
raise cyber security awareness. Fundamental cyber security life skills
should be taught at primary school, delivered to all pupils, ensuring that
awareness is raised in all genders equally. Cyber security awareness and
resilience is too important for any government to leave to chance
(Renaud et al., 2018 ).
Figure 5 shows where cyber security education is currently being
delivered (at University), and where it ought to be delivered (at Primary
School). Moving it earlier will ensure that when people get their ﬁrst
smartphone they will already have suf ﬁcient awareness and skills to
secure their new devices. It is also likely to remove the gender differences
we observed in our study.
6. Conclusion
This study investigated smartphone cyber security awareness
amongst students at a South African university. We con ﬁrmed the bene ﬁt
of a CS education in this respect: a heartening yet disappointing ﬁnding.The former because this means the university is doing a great job of
improving awareness in CS teaching. The latter because anyone who is
not enrolled for a CS course at university is not getting the requisite in-
formation to be able to improve their own cyber resilience. This means
that the South African approach to cyber security awareness is failing, in
terms of producing a cyber resilient population.
Moreover, the extant imbalance between genders in CS degrees
means that South African women are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
This suggests an urgent need to teach cyber security principles much
earlier in the educational system so that the cyber resilience of all South
Africans, regardless of gender, can be assured.

Abstract
Purpose –This paper aims to report the initial findings of a project aiming to re-establish basic education in
conflict-ravaged states in Northeastern Nigeria and to improve education providers ’ability to plan and deliver
basic educational services. The authors present a preliminary analysis of Nigerian teachers ’access to
information communication technology (ICT), their technology skills, as well associated national ICT policies.
Design/methodology/approach –This case study uses results from two co-designed tools, administered
using KoboToolbox to Education Managers in the first instance, and teachers in the second. The data from the
tools form the basis for analysis.
Findings –In the first instance, educational managers reported a lack of access to technology, the internet and
to training and professional development. In the second instance, teachers reported issues present in the
classroom environment, including poor infrastructure, a lack of resources and over-crowded classrooms. Very
few teachers had access to computers or to the internet.
Research limitations/implications –The 33 educational managers represent a small sample size and may
not be fully representative of the region covered. The ICT Capacity Audit tool listed Excel in two different areas
–basic Excel skills and using Excel for data analysis –which could have caused confusion for participants. The
data collection should be repeated, expanded and compared for consistency. For the team, changes to the
proposed (SENSE) box content meant that we were not able to deliver low-tech tools, such as Boogie Boards, or
high-tech tools, such as tablets, to schools.
Originality/value –Despite seemingly insurmountable challenges, the research team identified low-tech tools
as a feasible resource in the classroom. Existing tools, such as teachers ’smartphones and use of the WhatsAppTechnological

Introduction
Information communication technology for education (ICT4E) has become one of the key
indicators of development and globalization as well as a staple of policies and strategies for
future advancement. Hawkridge (1990) identified four policy goals in relation to ICT4E in
developed countries established during its rise in the 1980s: (1) improve students ’computer
skills, (2) apply computer technologies in the instruction of traditional subjects, (3) transform
education through technology and (4) facilitate students ’computer competencies as
preparation for employment. Writing about Jordan, Hawkridge (1990) describes how using
technology in education results in economic benefits, as has been shown throughout the
world. In Jordan, the impact of globalization has shifted consideration of ICT4E toward its
potential economic benefits, such as training to create a technology-savvy population for the
information and communication technology (ICT) industry ( Kozma and Vota, 2014 ). The
stimulus of ICT in education in developing countries is often associated with the One Laptop
Per Child (OLPC) initiative ( Warschauer and Ames, 2010 ), which exploits laptop portability
and internet access to educate poor and remote students and develop their technology skills
to prepare them for the global knowledge economy ( Stratton et al., 2019 ).
There are many challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa with meeting the United Nations
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and
promote lifelong learning opportunities for all ”(United Nations, 2019 ). While access to technology
is of great interest, there are many competing i ssues. In Northeast Nigeria, researchers on an
education-focused proj ect observed problems with the infras tructure in schools. The Boko Haram
insurgency, which began in 2009, has left many b uildings in disrepair or partially destroyed.
Many schools lack basic sanitary facilities, runnin g water, have limited or inconsistent access to
electricity, no internet access, minimal classroo m furniture, old or damaged chalkboards and an
overall lack of classroom supplies. Furthermore, analysis of ICT4E i nitiatives raises questions
about their presumed impact on such aspects of learners ’development as critical thinking and
collaboration ( Evans and Popova, 2016 ;Zheng et al.,2 0 1 6 ).
Warschauer and Matuchniak (2010) suggest that the relationship between accessible
information communication technology and inequality involve complexities that will take far
more than the distribution of computers to address. The inequality or digital divide between
those who have access to and use of technologies and those who do not involve a wide
spectrum of issues and specificities, such as individuals ’ethnicity, demographics, education
as well as types of technology and its use ( van Dijk, 2005 ). In this vein, Gunkel (2003) states
that regardless of the numerous benefits that technology may bring, the idea that technology
will enable a whole new world of endless opportunities free from problematic sociocultural
aspects is simply utopic. Thus, digital inequality is a complex issue, which is linked to
existing social, economic and cultural divisions in society ( van Dijk, 2020 ). In this vein,
Aduwa-Ogiegbaen and Iyamu (2005) state categorically that “what is wrong with education
cannot be fixed with technology ”(p. 104). Along these lines, Stratton et al. (2019) , in their
analysis of the failures of ICT4E initiatives, distinguish first-order factors, i.e. basic
infrastructure affordances, such as electricity and internet connectivity, from second-order
factors, i.e. sociocultural, such as teaching practices rooted in teachers ’beliefs about teaching
and learning. They argue that addressing the first-order factors is necessary but notAJIMsufficient for successful ICT4E initiatives, and more attention to second-order factors is
required. However, as we found in our study, first-order factors must be improved before
second-order factors can be considered.
Avgerou (2010) identified two perspectives on ICT-enabled development: (1) the progressive
perspective, which considers ICT as an enabler of transformations in multiple domains of
human activities, and (2) the disruptive perspective, which premises on the highly political and
controversial nature of development and reveals conflicts of interest and struggles of power as
a necessary part of ICT innovation in developing countries. With regard to the successful
implementation of ICT4E initiatives, Stratton et al. (2019) argue that “national discourse and
materiality interact, and designers of initiatives need to be aware of the kinds of choices that
this interaction sets up for translating policy goals into teaching and learning practices and
outcomes ”(p. 20). Previously, Leonardi (2008) had emphasized that national discourse “may
have the power to shape the construction process by divesting the users of their agency to align
new technology with existing cultural practice ”(p. 980). Thus, Stratton et al. ’s (2019)
triangulation of ICT4E policies and teaching and learning practices and outcomes in Uruguay
and Bolivia found that in Uruguay, portability and connectivity were central ICT4E
components in a country ’s national discourse. This outcome resonated fully with the global
impetus for computers in education to prepare for a global knowledge economy. On the other
hand, in Bolivia, portability and connectivity were not required as the national discourse simply
favored computers in education to aid traditional pedagogies and content areas (p. 20).
This paper reports on an investigation into possible application of ICT4E in Nigeria
through the examination of related national ICT policies and implementation of a United
States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded project. The initial goal of the
project is to re-establish basic education in conflict-ravaged states in Northeastern Nigeria
and improve education providers ’ability to plan and deliver basic educational services in line
with the policies of the state ’s education sector, including implementing technology.
Our project aims to address the acute educational needs resulting from disrupted access to
education in the conflict-ravaged states in Northeastern Nigeria while laying a foundation to re-
establish basic education and to improve teachers ’ability to plan and deliver basic educational
services. Specifically, the focus is on an ICT4E case in two states of Nigeria: Adamawa and
Gombe, through an examination of related ICT4E policies and educational managers ’
perceptions of accessibility of ICT as well as associated challenges. There is a specific reason
why we chose these two states. Initially, the team wanted to address the four Northeasternstates in Nigeria, including Borno, Adamawa, Yobe and Gombe states. However, the Boko
Haram insurgency, which has been on-going in the Northeast since 2009, made it too dangerous
for the research team to go to Borno and Yobe states. Risks of traveling in these areas include
poor transportation infrastructure, terrorism, kidnappings and armed attacks ( US Department
of State, 2020 ). Many internally displaced people (IDPs) have moved to Adamawa and Gombe
states, and because the lead partner is based in Adamawa, the decision was made to focus on
these two states. We present a preliminary analysis of Nigerian teachers ’access to ICT, their
technology skills, as well associated national ICT policies –and how these combine to impede
change. Based on this analysis, recommendations for second-order factors and low-tech
solutions that may catalyze educational projects in developing countries are proposed.
Background
In 2019, American University of Nigeria (AUN) and two US-based universities (Kent State
University and Columbia University ’s Center for Sustainable Development) received a nearly
US$14m USAID grant called Strengthening Education in Northeast Nigerian States (SENSE)
Activity. At the launch of the project, a primary goal of both the funding agency and the team
members was to get technology into classrooms in Northeast Nigeria, taking them from “no-Technological
interventions
for educationtech”to at least “low-tech ”environments. Part of this came from a desire to bring classrooms
to a level approaching what exists in the developed world. The project started with a baseline
scan of the environment in these classrooms. Over the next six months, the team worked first
to develop data collection tools that were subsequently deployed by the Nigerian team, then
visited Nigeria to collect more data via interviews, observations and co-design activities.
This paper addresses data gathered via KoboTools. All data gathered to date point to an
overall lack of resources in general, from damaged buildings to worn-out chalkboards, to a
lack of the most basic classroom materials, such as pencils and paper. During the initial six-
month period, USAID refocused the grant, and the emphasis changed from a focus on
technology to a focus on basic educational materials, including printed teacher guides and
pupil books. While the team had initially suggested creating classroom boxes filled with
teaching materials for each classroom, and library boxes (one per school) that would include
solar-powered tablets, the team instead recommended boxes with low-tech content, such as
radios and LCD eWriters, such as Boogie Boards, which have a seven-year battery.
Literature review
ICT4E initiatives in Nigeria began in the early 2000s when the Federal Ministry of Education
(MoE) launched a program to equip all schools in Nigeria with computers and other
communication technologies ( Adomi and Kpangban, 2010 ). In 2004, the Federal Government
of Nigeria adopted the National Policy on Education, which outlined the roadmap for
integration of ICT into secondary education in Nigeria, including the government ’s
commitment to providing basic infrastructure and training for schools. Nigeria ’s most recent
Ministry of Communication Technology Na tional Information and Communication
Technology Policy ( 2012) also emphasizes education as one of the key areas for adapting
information communication technologies, including the government ’s strategic plan to:
(1) Promote the incorporation of ICT within the education curriculum at all levels;(2) Introduce mandatory training and appropriate courses for ICT at all tiers of
education;
(3) Foster an ICT-driven educational administration environment;(4) Promote ICT awareness and proficiency in mass and non-formal education, with an
emphasis on children, youth, women and the physically challenged;
(5) Provide personal computers in public places (e.g. post offices, schools, public libraries,
etc.) in small and large communities to help low-income segments of society gain
access to the internet and for educational purposes; and
(6) Promote free and open-source software (FOSS) for development, education and
general use in the country (2012).
However, the implementation of these policies in Nigeria has been facing a number of
challenges and constraints because the policies overestimate the possibilities for the
materialization of limited resources and elicit unrealistic expectations. These challenges
include a lack of human resources (e.g. qualified teachers), adequate physical facilities (i.e.
wired classrooms and libraries, stable electricity and water supply), reliable data to facilitate
the effective implementation of educational plans, as well as the overall interplay of
government politics infused with wide-spread corruption ( Okoroma, 2006 ).Adomi and
Kpangban ’s (2010) analysis of factors influencing the adoption of ICTs in Nigerian secondary
schools in Edo and Delta states revealed that limited information infrastructure, a lack of ICT
facilities, frequent interruptions in electrical service and an overall absence of ways to
integrate such ICTs into the school curriculum, as well as overall poor policies and strategiesAJIMfor ICT implementation, were the main contributors to the low rate of ICT adoption and
application of technologies in Nigerian schools. Along these lines, Aduwa-Ogiegbaen and
Iyamu (2005) pointed out that obstacles preventing the use of ICT in secondary education in
Nigeria included the high cost of computer hardware and software, weak infrastructure, lack
of human skills in and knowledge about ICT and a lack of educationally relevant and
culturally appropriate software for Nigeria. They also observed that secondary schools in
Nigeria had not been given enough funds to provide adequate classrooms, furniture and
appropriate textbooks, let alone high-tech equipment, summing up with the conclusion that
“Nigeria is on the wrong side of the international digital divide as it has not made significant
effort to integrate ICT into secondary school curriculum ”(p. 104).
Distance and mobile learning are increasingly considered as an essential part of the
learning process ( Cabrol and Severin, 2010 ;Georgiev et al., 2004 ). According to Pew Research
Center ’s (2018) global attitudes survey, the increased internet connectivity in Sub-Saharan
Africa, including Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania, is positively
correlated with such lifestyle outcomes as use of cell phones and associated overall use of the
internet (see also Poushter, 2016 ). According to The Economist , among social media
platforms, “WhatsApp, which has 1.5bn users globally, is especially influential in Africa ”
(The Economist, 2019 ) and is the most popular social media platform in Nigeria. The fact that
WhatsApp has a voice message option means that it can be used by people of low or no
literacy. The large majority of survey respondents also noted that increasing use of the
internet had a positive influence on education as well as the economy, personal relationships
and politics ( Silver and Johnson, 2018 ). However, Kolawole (2017) argues that an overall lack
of internet connectivity in Nigeria is responsible for the “digital marginalization ”that is still
subject to high concern (p. 154). Along these lines, Obgo et al. (2017) observed a large digital
divide between urban and rural cell phone users.
ICT4E initiatives are part of a larger ecosystem comprised of complex sociotechnical
relationships among people, institution s, resources (tangible and intangible) and
infrastructures. Thus, these relationships inevitably shape the success of ICT4E. Clark
and Mayer (2016) observed that throughout the history of educational technology, there have
been strong expectations and claims that the newest technology would revolutionize
education; yet, in each case, the potential was not reached. Clark and Mayer speculate that one
of the reasons for the disappointing history of educational technology could be the fact that
instructors expected learners to adapt to the technology and hardly considered theimportance of designing learning environments that would be consistent with how
individuals learn. Along these lines, Stratton et al. (2019) argue that the failure of ICT4E
initiatives is often associated with the role of the materiality of the underlying technologies
and infrastructure; yet, the greater influence of materiality in terms of interaction with higher-
level factors, such as a national discourse on ICT4E, is often understudied.
Through the lens of Nigerian ICT discourse, this study examines two aspects of
materiality upon which ICT4E initiatives are enacted, specifically, technology skills of
educators and connectivity. Along with the basic infrastructure, educators ’technology skills
and connectivity are two fundamental re quirements for shaping the successful
implementation of ICT4E. The lack of bas ic infrastructure and resources makes
implementation challenging in this region. Subsequently, this study also proposes a
framework for applying low-cost ICT solutions for education in Nigeria.
Theoretical framework
Numerous learning theories demonstrate that technology in the classroom enhances learning.
In learning environments, accessible technology such as mobile devices can meet immediate
needs. To support this, a learning theory that emerges is the socially shared cognition theoryTechnological
interventions
for education(SCT) ( Thompson and Fine, 1999 ). In SCT, learners are participants in a community in which
cognition is shared among the participants, the artifacts and tools they are using and the
social institutions in which the learning occurs ( Brown and Cole, 2000 ). In this situation,
teachers can receive professional development information via digital devices and share it
with their students and other teachers. Technology, in this case, helps to disseminate
knowledge through the learning community, making students active participants and
ultimately leading to cognition ( Bell and Winn, 2000 ).
Furthermore, technology in the classroom provides a means for authentic and active
learning, also known as student- or learner-centered learning ( Doak, 2009 ). During active
learning, the focus is on students ’efforts to construct their knowledge ( Carr et al.,2 0 1 5 ). The
constructivist learning theory emphasizes that individuals learn through building their own
knowledge, connecting new ideas and experiences to existing knowledge and experiences to
form new or enhanced understanding ( Bransford et al. , 1999 ). According to the social
constructivism theory, this learning happens “primarily through social interaction with others,
such as a teacher or a learner ’sp e e r s ”(Cambridge International, 2019 , p. 1), and technology can
facilitate this. The ultimate advantage of promoting active learning is that it “fosters students ’
learning and their autonomy, giving them greater involvement and control over their learning
and giving them skills of life-long learning ...and develop[ing] their metacognitive thinking ”
(Cambridge International, 2019 , p. 2). Therefore, the effective use of technology in the classroom
has the potential to allow students to interact with the learning process as they develop their
understanding. In support, Fouts (2000) observes that “because many new technologies are
interactive, it is now easier to create environments in which students can learn by doing, receive
feedback, and continually refine their understanding and build new knowledge ”(p. 11).
Through the shared knowledge, explained above, technology promotes constructivism,
which enables students to retain a deeper conceptual understanding of the content being
taught. Also, in situations where qualified teachers are neither available nor sufficiently
knowledgeable, instructional technology becomes the lifeline to students by providing the
needed content and pedagogy.
Yet, the successful implementation of ICTs in a learning environment is not simply
transferred across various sociotechnical systems. In this regard, Avgerou and Walsham
(2017) state that the organizational logic, work practices as well as cultural conditions
surrounding and enabling such technologies in their original context are often alien to the
recipient context. Leonardi (2011) points out that the routines and technologies are the
infrastructure or building blocks that the imbrication of human and material agencies (i.e. the
capacity for nonhuman entities to act on their own without human intervention) produce.
Leonardi (2011) further clarifies that by keeping a distinction between human and material
agencies, the imbrication metaphor differentiates the relationship between people and
technologies: “people have agency and technologies have agency, but ultimately, people
decide how they will respond to a technology ”(p. 151). From the imbrication lens, both
humans and material agencies are interwoven and necessary for changes in technologies and
in individual ’s interactions ( Leonardi, 2011 ).
From this vantage point, the interplay between various sociotechnical relationships, i.e.
individuals and their related skills, technologies, resources and policies, is key for the success
of ICT4E initiatives. Applying the sociotechnical approach and metaphor of imbrication, this
study aims to examine how ICT-related policies, infrastructure and human agents as well as
how their related skills contribute to shaping ICT4E initiatives in Nigeria.
Research question
At the beginning of the project, even as the team was writing the proposal for the grant, it was
clear that Northeastern Nigeria was in a state of educational crisis. Poverty and the BokoAJIMHaram insurgency had negatively impacted schools and education in general. According to
World Bank data, the literacy rate of all young people in Nigeria aged 15 –24 is about 68% for
females and 82% for males ( UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2018 ). These numbers change
drastically when only the Northeast is considered, resulting in an environment that reports
up to 80% illiteracy. In this region, many children, especially girls, are kept out of school for a
variety of reasons: e.g. families often need children (especially girls) to help with work around
the home; girls are often married early; or families are unable to provide even basic fees to
cover uniforms and books (which even government schools require). In addition, schools
frequently lack basic sanitary facilities, and classrooms are not inviting –many are
overcrowded, in a state of disrepair or completely destroyed. Given these challenges, this
paper investigated the following broad research question:
RQ1. What are the capacities of educational systems in Adamawa and Gombe states of
Nigeria to implement the Nigerian national ICT policies for education?
Methodology
A case study approach is being used with the broader study to understand the educational
needs in Adamawa and Gombe states. The case study methods include surveys, interviews,
focus groups, observations and co-design activities done with a variety of participant groups
that play a role in the educational systems in Northeast Nigeria. The case study approach was
chosen because according to Gerring (2004) , it can provide a good understanding of a causal
mechanism or interplay between general knowledge of the world with empirical knowledge
of how particular phenomena are interrelated.
However, to answer the research question guiding this more specific exploration of ICT4E
initiatives in Nigeria and how it informs the broader study, this paper reports on the data from
two tools that were administered as a part of the case study: (1) the ICT Capacity Audit
Questionnaire and (2) the Teacher Audit and Observation for Teaching and Learning Materials
(TLM) Tool. The ICT Capacity Audit Questionnaire consisted of 20 questions mainly focused
on the availability of ICT equipment and the ICT knowledge and skills of their staff. The
Teacher Audit and Observation for TLM Tool included both a questionnaire and a structured
observation component. The questionnaire portion consisted of 15 questions focused on
demographics, presence of and support for technology in the classroom and the challenges they
face. The observation portion looked at all aspects of the classroom, including the physical
environment, curriculum, resources and more. The initial development of the tools was done
collaboratively by all three universities during summer 2019. The tools were then refined by the
lead institution and loaded into KoBoToolbox to be administered on Android tablets in the field.
The team chose the open-source KoBoToolbox ( KoBo Toolbox at the Harvard Humanitarian
Initiative, n.d. ) as a data-gathering tool for this project, as it allows researchers to administer
surveys and questionnaires on Android phones or tablets in offline settings.
Participants
All subjects were recruited via purposive snowball sampling from schools participating in the
project. This process involved asking participants for recommendations of acquaintances
who might qualify for participation, leading to referral chains. Taking into consideration the
need for the knowledge insider to locate people for the study, this method was considered as
most suitable. The purposive snowball sampling resulted in the ICT Capacity Audit
Questionnaire being administered to 33 staff (22 from Adamawa state and 11 from Gombe
state) from the Department of Planning, Research and Statistics (DPRS) (which consists of the
DPRS, the Education Management Information Systems (EMIS) and the Department of
Quality Assurance (DQA) units) of the MoE and State Universal Basic Education BoardTechnological
interventions
for education(DPRS, EMIS, DQA units). The Teacher Audit and Observation for TLM Tool was
administered to 423 primary teachers from 69 schools, of which 42 schools were located in
Adamawa state and 27 schools were in Gombe state.
Data collection
Because many areas in Northeast Nigeria experience unreliable internet connection and
access to computers, tablets and mobile phones can be limited, the questionnaires and
observations were administered in-person by the lead institution ’s monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) team. These researchers traveled to the schools and the different educational offices
and administered the questionnaires verbally with the participants and recorded their
responses to each question on Android tablets using KoboToolbox. For the classroom
observations, the researcher added notes under each observation prompt in KoboToolbox
while on-site. When researchers returned to internet access, the data they had collected on-site
were uploaded to the cloud, where it was shared with the wider team. The tools were
implemented by the Nigerian team during fall 2019, according to the steps outlined below:
(1) August –September 2019: Development of KoboToolbox for data collection;
(2) The paper-based questionnaires were entered into KoboToolbox, deployed on the
KoboToolbox platform and subsequently downloaded to Android tablets in
preparation for data collection from respondents;
(3) September 2019: Training of researchers on both tools;
(4) The project M&E researchers were first given a half-day training on the tablets
equipped with both tools on the KoBoToolbox platform;
(5) September –October 2019: Administration of tools in Adamawa and Gombe states:
/C15Administration of ICT Capacity Audit questionnaires to 33 education managers
took place from September 28, 2019, to October 2, 2019.
/C15Administration of Teacher Audit and Observation for TLM to 423 primary 2,3,4and 5 literacy and numeracy teachers in 69 schools selected for the project took
place from September 15, 2019, to September 26, 2019.
(6) October 2019: Data uploaded to KoboToolbox.
Data from the tools were synched to the KoboToolbox platform. The data were then
downloaded for analysis.
While the lead institution conducted all of the data collection, many of the findings, such as
intermittent access to electricity in classrooms and lack of technology, were also observed
(and confirmed) in schools by the research teams from the other two universities during visits
to Northeastern Nigeria.
Analysis and results
The KoboToolbox data were exported to Excel, and answers were grouped thematically. The
first set of results below are from the ICT Capacity Audit, in which educational managers
revealed information about access to electricity, internet, the training required to get a job as
an educational manager and professional development. The data also included educational
managers ’descriptions of their own qualifications and work environments. The second set of
results describes teachers ’access to electricity, internet, technology and provides information
about the general state of classrooms while also including self-reported data from the
teachers on their qualifications, access to technology and classroom environments.AJIMTool #1: information and communication technology capacity audit
Electricity
In response to the question Do you have challenges related to the availability of electricity :1 6
education managers reported limitations on supply (of electricity), 15 reported frequent
outages and 13 said they have no back-up generators. Two reported “other ”problems related
to electricity but did not specify what those were. Further, in open-ended responses,
participants shared that inconsistent and insufficient electricity leads to problems with
productivity at work, such as the following:
(1) It causes distracted attention while working, and when the AC is on, some appliances
may not work due to limited power supply.
(2) Once our power goes off, all of our office work stops.(3) It causes delays in my work and can sometimes corrupt data on the computer and
affect time management.
Others said the lack of electricity (and subsequent lack of air conditioning) leads to lower
productivity and even health problems.
Internet access
Of the 33 education managers, 14 reported having a dedicated computer for storage and
retrieval of data, and 19 had none. Of those with computers, only two reported having access
to the internet. Despite the relative lack of access to technology and the overall lack of access
to the internet, Table 1 shows participants ’understanding of qualifications necessary for
their positions, and 12 of the participants reported that computer skills were a requirement
when they applied for their jobs.
Others reported different qualifications: five reported that post-primary education and a civil
service commission were required; six relate d that just the Civil Service Commission was
required; and ten said that “qualifications ”or“experience ”(neither of which were defined) were
necessary.
Qualifications
Participants perceived the ability to use technology as being important to their work.
Qualitative answers elaborating on the question: “describe the criteria for how staff are
posted to this unit, ”included the following:
(1) You must be computer literate.
(2) You must be computer literate and hardworking.(3) You need to have a certificate, diploma or degree in computer science.
Despite the fact that computer skills were a desirable qualification, respondents reported low
proficiency in basic Microsoft Office applications ( Table 2 ). Nearly half of the education
administrators reported having beginner-level skills in the use of the Microsoft Office

were asked about their knowledge with MS Excel twice: the first (MS Excel 1) asked about
their knowledge of basic Excel skills, and the second asked about their ability to use Excel for
statistical analysis. In total, 18 participants reported having beginner-level basic Excel skills.
Overall, respondents reported marginal skills in using data analysis software such as
SPSS, STATA, CSPRO and MS Excel, with most having either beginner-level skills or none at
all, but surprisingly, in answer to the question: “do you have the skills to analyze, interpret
and report associated educational data, ”20 participants reported that they did. An “other ”
category on the KoboToolbox questionnaire would have given us more information about
alternative tools that might be used locally to analyze data. Such tools might include analog
tools, such as calculators, or manual analysis, especially based on the issues with electricity
and a lack of computers reported herein. Future research could examine this further.
Professional development
The data revealed that there is a lack of professional development available for educational
managers. Only four participants indicated the availability of training in the analysis of
educational data for decision-making purposes.
The Teacher Audit and Observation Tool, which was administered to teachers in
Adamawa and Gombe states, provided answers to similar questions regarding the capacity
for technology in the classrooms. As shown below, most teachers face dire first-factor
problems, from overcrowding to a drastic lack of the most basic materials in the classroom.
The absence of technology is just one more piece in the overall dearth of resources.
Tool #2: Teacher Audit and Observation for Teaching and Learning Materials
The Teacher Audit and Observation for TLM tool was administered to 423 teachers, of which274 were located in Adamawa state and 176 were in Gombe state. Questions from the tool that
related to the capacity for adding technology to the curriculum included: (1) is there an
internet connection in the classroom; (2) is there technology in the classroom; (3) number of
students present. The observations helped to inform these same topics by including prompts
focused on the physical environment and the presence of resources.
Overcrowding
During the observations, researchers answered whether or not the classrooms looked
overcrowded and described classroom settings (e.g. materials available for the teacher and
students). A lack of infrastructure (i.e. buildings, classrooms) and teachers in the region has
led to widespread overpopulation in classrooms (by western educational standards).Level of proficiency None Beginner Intermediate Advanced Total

theme emerged in the observation notes:
(1) The classroom is overcrowded, and pupils are having to sit on the floor.(2) The children are all sitting on the floor, and the class is overcrowded.
Resources, including technology
The observation notes revealed a recurring theme of participants describing first-factor
issues of limited or no classroom resources, all of which would make it difficult if not
impossible, to add technology to the curriculum. Sample comments follow:
(1) The blackboard is in bad condition, as are standard chairs and benches. Writing
materials, such as chalk, is not available.
(2) There are no materials in the classroom.
(3) There is a lack of chairs and desks and a lack of teaching material. Children are not
properly dressed.
(4) There are no tables and desks. No infrastructure such as toilets. There is a lack of
clean water and electricity. There is no curriculum, and no learning materials for both
student and teacher. The classrooms are overcrowded and in very poor condition.
One teacher described a lack of technology simply as referring to a non-existent fan:
(1) Lack of electronic device, e.g. fan.
Two respondents reported evidence of material from other non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), such as UNICEF:
(1) There is a blackboard, two UNICEF calendars on sanitation and a waste bin and
benches.
(2) The class has been well renovated by UNICEF. There is a new bench and desk and a
new chalkboard.
Of all 423 respondents, only one teacher confirmed an internet connection in his or her
classroom, and only three reported that they had technology in their classrooms. In each case,
the numbers represent less than 1% of the classrooms included in the data collection. While
overcrowding and infrastructure challenges are arguably more critical than a lack of
technology in the classroom, there are spaces where the incorporation of technology could
ameliorate some of the deficiencies, especially in the areas of teaching and instructional
materials.
Discussion
Unfortunately, the preliminary findings of this project do not demonstrate significant
development of ICT4E in the Nigerian states of Adamawa and Gombe, since the early 2000s.
While this case study is based on data from states that are currently among the most
vulnerable to political unrest, our initial findings demonstrate a disconnect between national
ICT policy and local realities. It appears that policies at the national level are not trickling
down to the local level, and as shown herein, in remote states in the Northeast, there is
virtually no support provided for the training and infrastructure building that is necessary to
create and sustain a technology-driven educational environment. Our findings reveal a vague
and outdated national discourse on ICT policies, combined with a severe lack of first-orderTechnological
interventions
for educationfactors, which prompts the question of which ICT4E solutions could be applicable to the
Northeast Nigerian context.
In line with earlier studies (e.g. Okoroma, 2006 ), there are persistent challenges to the
application of ICTs to education in Nigeria, including inadequate supply of electricity, scarce
internet access, infrastructure issues and a need for overall technology training and
professional development.
This study echoes Aduwa-Ogiegbaen and Iyamu ’s (2005) study, in which they identified
obstacles that prevent the use of ICT in Nigeria, i.e. weak infrastructure, lack of human skills
in and knowledge about ICT, inadequate funds to provide furniture, appropriate textbooks
and adequate classrooms, let alone high-tech equipment. Unfortunately, Aduwa-Ogiegbaen
and Iyamu ’s (2005) conclusion that “Nigeria is on the wrong side of the international digital
divide as it has not made significant effort to integrate ICT into secondary school curriculum ”
(p. 104) still rings relevant today.
Based on these preliminary findings, it may be argued that building the human and
technology capacity to effectively implement ICT4E is crucial to achieving much-needed
educational progress in Nigeria. In particular, the following actions might facilitate this
process at the national level:
(1) Collaborate at a grassroots-level with leaders in local education systems to facilitate
the development of realistic and well-defined national ICT4E policies;
(2) Define benchmarks and/or indicators to assess capacity and evaluate future
development of ICT4E;
(3) Develop the capacity to attract, absorb and manage resources to facilitate effective
ICT4E projects; and
(4) Build the human capacity to strengthen the education system.
On a local level, identifying human agents, institutions and solutions that can be mobilized
could help to advance ICT4E initiatives in a programmatic and targeted fashion. For
example, a growing number of teachers and education managers have smartphones and use
WhatsApp to communicate ( Madge et al. , 2019 ). Using WhatsApp, educational managers
could identify and share material that could be transmitted via this tool, such as training
videos or course content housed in an organized digital repository. There might also be steps
to ease the teachers ’burden to cover fees associated with the use of their personal devices.
Whether or not the team ’s proposed low-tech tools are funded by the grant, creative and
resourceful solutions are needed.
Another low-cost ICT solution could be the development of educational telecenters and
radio stations to enhance access to quality educational resources. Echoing Obayelu and
Ogunlade (2006) , this paper argues that new ICT initiatives and opportunities for education
are key in the process of self-determination, economic, social and cultural advancement as
well as employment beyond the scope of traditional institutions and any forms of governance.
Limitations and future research
There are many limitations to the initial data presented here. First of all, the 33 educational
managers represent a small sample size and may not be fully representative of the region
covered. The ICT Capacity Audit tool listed Excel in two different areas –basic Excel skills
and using Excel for data analysis –which could have caused confusion for participants. The
tools asked questions about their skills with the Microsoft Office Applications, but not about
open-source applications, such as those available under G Suite ( Google LLC, 2020 ). The data
collection should be repeated, expanded and compared for consistency. For the team, changesAJIMto the proposed SENSE box content meant that we were not able to deliver low-tech tools,
such as Boogie Boards, or high-tech tools, such as tablets, to schools. Instead, a future study
might pilot existing tools, such as the WhatsApp application, as a tool for professional
development and educational content delivery.
Conclusion
Despite the fact that the Nigerian Federal MoE launched a program in the early 2000s to equip
all schools in Nigeria with computers and ICTs as described above, and a USAID grant to
improve educational outcomes initially focused on including some tech solutions for Nigerian
classrooms, the situation in Northeast Nigeria complicates bringing technology to the
schools. While research shows that low-tech or high-tech tools can support educational
efforts, and our findings reveal that education managers and teachers are hopeful for change,
an overall lack of resources makes it difficult to justify the addition of technology. Despite
this, when the team visited educational managers and teachers in Nigeria, many were
observed having personal cell phones. With the reported popularity of WhatsApp application
as an informal platform for learning ( Mpungose, 2020 ) and the expansion of the WhatsApp
application in Northeastern Nigeria (as described above), it seems that WhatsApp would be a
relatively accessible tool for content delivery for both educators and learners. Moreover,
Mpungose (2020) argues that WhatsApp may help students to socialize with the learning
activities and bring them into their informal experience collaboratively to undergo
assessment as learning. Just as mobile phone penetration has expanded rapidly in the
Northeast, it is anticipated that internet access will grow quickly as well. And, while this does
not help the issues with infrastructure, it could help increase access to educational content
and professional development.
Having technologies and routines as building blocks imbricating the human and material
agencies ( Leonardi, 2011 ), understanding the human agents ’response or adaption of a
technology is vital for the success of ICT4E. Through this understanding of how the features,
functionality or affordances of technologies are activated in the context of its use may enable a
vision of how technologies as well associated practices and policies could improve individuals ’
education and lives at large. In line with previous studies (e.g. Avgerou and Walsham, 2017 ;
Leonardi, 2011 ), this paper urges the consideration of ICT4E in the context of the socio-technical
ecosystem, including, but not limited to, infrastructure, institutions, policies and, most
importantly, skilled human agents to ensure the success of ICT4E initiatives in Nigeria.

INTRODUCTION
The rapid spread of digital/social media has led to considerable
academic debate regarding their role in the lives of children andadolescents. The Global North, especially United States and
Europe, has largely led this discussion in matters of research
methods and approaches, conversations around screen time,wellbeing, media literacy, and digital citizenship ( Ellison et al.,
2007 ;Best et al., 2014 ;Livingstone, 2014 ;Frau-Meigs et al., 2017 ;
Vlaanderen et al., 2020 ). Prior literature in the Global North on
media literacy, social connectedness, and digital citizenship,especially with regard to parent-child relationships, has mostlyfocused on topics such as online risks ( Staksrud et al., 2013 ;
Livingstone, 2014 ;Livingstone et al., 2017 ), health and wellbeing
(McDool et al., 2020 ;Best et al., 2014 ;Ellison et al., 2007 ;
Valkenburg et al., 2006 ), creative expression ( Subrahmanyam
et al., 2020 ;boyd, 2008 ;Hogan, 2010 ;Lenhart et al., 2015 ),
education and learning ( Bennett et al., 2008 ;Burn et al., 2010 ;
Friedman and Friedman, 2013 ), digital safety ( Ringrose et al.,
2013 ;Livingstone et al., 2014 ;Marwick and boyd, 2014 ), and
parental mediation ( Tripp, 2011 ;Duggan et al., 2015 ;Kalmus
et al., 2015 ;Livingstone and Blum-Ross, 2020 ). However, it is not
clear to what extent and how these Eurocentric approaches todigital literacy and social connectedness translate to various localrealities of the Global South, where increasing numbers of youngpeople have either direct or indirect access to social media and theinternet, but occupy very different social contexts as compared totheir counterparts in the Global North ( Rangaswamy and Arora,
2016 ;Banaji, 2017 ).
In India, low cost mobile phones, cheap data plans, and
vernacularization of content have furthered access cuttingacross socioeconomic strata ( Rangaswamy and Arora, 2016 ).
The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India(ASSOCHAM, 2015 ) conducted a survey on social media habits
of children with 4,750 parents in metropolitan cities (SocialDevelopment Foundation, 2015) claiming 95% teens surveyedused the internet, 81% used social media and 72% logged intosocial media more than once a day. It also uncovered underageuse: 65% kids under 13 years used social media. At the same time,
media alarms us with stories like ‘Indian teenagers show risky
behaviour online: McAfee ’(Press Trust of India (PTI), 2014 )o r
‘Addicted to You(Tube): To say that toddlers are nuts about
YouTube would be an understatement ’(Kumar, 2015 )o r ‘One in
three teens lose sleep over gadgets, social media ’(Dutt, 2016 ).
Social media and technology are not always portrayed in a bad
light. There were articles about using social media forassignments and exam preparation ( Pednekar, 2016 )o r
experts wanting to include it in school curriculum ( Pednekar,
2017 )—but positive, or even more re ﬂective, stories are harder to
come by. Perhaps, the older generation mirrors its struggles and
anxieties of navigating through the complex web of social media
on young people and their protective instinct comes to the fore?Children are considered vulnerable and in need of protectionacross almost all disciplines. However, young people ’s
engagement with digital/social media is very different fromthat of adults. Children ’s practices online have evolved
differently because they are (often described as) ‘digital
natives ’(Burn et al., 2010 ). Of course, the impact of the
COVID-19 related lockdown subsequent to March 2020 has
shifted perspectives considerably in relation to some of thesedebates, with focus returning once more (in the populardiscourse) to accessibility and digital literacy and sideliningconcerns around screen time and other related debates.
In this paper, we share insights from in-depth personal
interviews with community leaders from civil society, researchand advocacy as well as professionals working with young peoplein India that address important questions relating to medialiteracy, social connectedness, and digital citizenship in adigital/social world. ‘Digital society ’is conceptualized as being
governed by ‘dataﬁcation ’and ‘platformisation ’asKatzenbach
and Bächle (2019) discussed the work (p. 4 –5) of Mejias and
Couldry who de ﬁned data ﬁcation as a, “cultural logic of
quanti ﬁcation and monetisation of human life through digital
information ”, and Poell, Nieborg and van Dijck who
conceptualized platformization as a “key development and
narrative of the digital society ”. Digital/social media platforms
are now “indispensable infrastructures of private and public
life...shifting cultural practices...becoming the dominant modeof economic and social organisation ”(Katzenbach and Bächle,
2019 , pp.5).
This paper addresses the following research questions:
(1) What speci ﬁc research priorities might emerge in the context
of India around media literacy, social connectedness, anddigital citizenship? How can these issues be studied inrelation to the lived realities of young people and their carers?
(2) How can we contextualize existing knowledge about digital
media use and literacy to help support young people andtheir adult caregivers and maximize bene ﬁts of this digital/
social world, while taking into account nuances of the local bymapping stakeholders and bringing in their voices?
In order to learn more about issues faced by parents and young
people as they navigate a digital/social media world in India, weinterviewed a range of stakeholders working directly or indirectlywith parents and young people, schools and teachers,international institutions and organizations.
MEDIA LITERACY, SOCIAL
CONNECTEDNESS, AND DIGITALCITIZENSHIP
Notwithstanding the recent efforts to expand the scope of media
literacy scholarship, much of the literature on children and mediahas focused on Western countries and on dominant groups
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 2Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiawithin the middle classes, which some scholars have referred to as
WEIRD families: those in Western, Educated, Industrialized,Rich, and Democratic contexts ( Henrich et al., 2010 ;Alper
et al., 2016 ). In Western democracies, citizenship is often tied
to behaviors such as voting, campaigning, volunteering,
petitioning, and protecting individuals ’rights. For instance,
Choi (2016) found that digital citizenship is conceptualized by
scholars in four main ways: in terms of ethics/safety, as political orpersonalized participation, the ability to evaluate information,and critical resistance/activism. Below, we have discussed somekey themes in the existing literature on digital citizenship amongyouth, including safety and privacy, engagement andparticipation, and the role of various stakeholders in differentlearning environments.
Safety and Privacy
One way in which digital citizenship has been conceptualized hasbeen through the lens of safety and privacy. Issues of ethics, mutualrespect, creating a safe environment, and digital rights andresponsibilities were central to such conceptualizations(Mossberger et al., 2007 ;Ohler, 2012 ;Robb and Shellenbarger,
2013;Frau-Meigs et al., 2017 ;Vlaanderen et al., 2020 ). The
discussion around risks and literacy has related mainly toidentifying different kinds of potential risks social media posefor children and youth and ways of mitigating them. Early workhas also been about quelling fears regarding technopanics —moral
panics over contemporary technology and its risks to young
users —e.g., cyberporn and online predators and showing links
between hyped media coverage and consequent content legislation(Cassell and Cramer, 2008 ;Marwick, 2008 ). The nuances of lived
realities were often ignored but recent studies have attempted toaddress these, for example, in Livingstone (2014) and work by
Staksrud and colleagues (2013) and more recent work has startedfocusing on strategies to help children minimize these risks(Livingstone et al., 2017 ;Desimpelaere et al., 2020 ). Some of
these discussions have also revolved around digital rights andresponsibilities, including free expression, respecting intellectual
property, digital etiquette and wellbeing, and lawful use of online
spaces ( Robb and Shellenbarger, 2013 ;McDool et al., 2020 ;
Subrahmanyam et al., 2020 ;Desimpelaere et al., 2020 ).
Concerns regarding safety (including bullying, shaming,
violence, and sexting) of young people on social media werealso important themes in the literature. Safety online has to dowith the environment available to children and youth, just as onewould expect safety at home, in school or at a mall. Livingstone
et al. (2014) found that children encountered solicitation of sex,
porn, violence, bullying, shaming, etc. online. They categorizedthese items into three types of risks: content related, conduct
related and contact related. Ringrose et al. (2013) found a link
between online and of ﬂine lives with gender issues reported in
sexting and shaming (girls especially) on social networking sites(SNSs). Other contextual variables —apart from gender —were
age, existing emotional issues, broader family context, andparents ’familiarity with technology with reference to
adolescents ’excessive internet use and parental mediation in
Europe ( Kalmus et al., 2015 ). Additionally, Marwick and boyd
(2014) described how ‘drama ’operates in teens ’online lives andhow widespread use of social media among teenagers has altered
dynamics of aggression and con ﬂict. Recent scholarship focused
on cyberbullying and how children can intervene to help victimsas well as parents ’role in imparting digital skills ( Vlaanderen
et al., 2020 ;Livingstone et al., 2017 ).
A related concern is that of privacy, which centers around the
control one exerts over the nature and amount of personalinformation that is shared on social media and howknowledge about protecting one ’s privacy online can help
children ( Lee 2013 ;Desimpelaere et al., 2020 ). Youth are
sharing more personal information on their pro ﬁ
les than in
the past. They choose private settings for Facebook, but sharewith large networks of friends. Most teen social media users saidthey aren ’t very concerned about third-party access to their data
(Madden et al., 2013 ).Marwick and boyd (2014) also noted that
social media has changed the ways in which one practices
visibility and information sharing, and offered a model ofnetworked privacy to explain how privacy is achieved innetworked publics. Another more recent study reported thatyoung people did not see their online and of ﬂine lives as
different and there was a relation between face-to-face anddigital interactions and self-esteem ( Palfrey, 2016 ;
Subrahmanyam et al., 2020 ).
Participation and Social Connectedness
Participation has been conceptualized as both political and civic
participation as well as personal or cultural participation. Work
on uses (including expression and presentation) of social mediaby children dealt with self-expression, identity formation, statusnegotiation and peer-to-peer sociality as observed by boyd
(2008) .Hogan (2010) described the splitting of self-
presentation into performances —synchronously situated —and
artifacts —asynchronously exhibited —derived from Goffman ’s
work on dramaturgy. Lenhart et al. (2015) described teens ’use
of social media for romantic purposes like ﬂirting, wooing,
breaking-up, controlling/abusing and sharing a (usuallyofﬂine) relationship online. Participation was also analyzed
from a uses and grati ﬁcations perspective ( Dunne et al., 2010 ;
Quan-Haase and Young, 2010 ).
Within the United States, social connectedness and digital
citizenship have been viewed largely through the lens ofparticipation, creative expressions, and popular culture. Forinstance, Jenkins (2006) argued for policy and educational
interventions to address the “participation gap ”in how young
people access and use media to develop competencies andexperiences to more fully express themselves as engagedcultural citizens. However, other scholars have emphasizedthat it is essential to foreground ethical and social justice
issues by reimagining media literacies and social
connectedness through civic engagement and anti-oppressionliteracies ( Scharrer and Ramasubramanian, 2015 ;Mihailidis
2018 ;Ramasubramanian and Darzabi, 2020 ).
Scholars also found association between social media use and
children ’s wellbeing. While social media use was found to be
strongly associated with social capital, it was not directly linkedwith wellbeing ( Ellison et al., 2007 ;Best et al., 2014 ). Researchers
have noted an absence of robust causal research regarding this
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 3Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiadirect impact. However, McDool et al. (2020) used proxy data to
point to potential adverse effects of increasing time spent onlineon children ’s wellbeing. Nonetheless, given that increase in
social capital enhanced adolescents ’self-esteem, and in turn,
a sense of wellbeing, this perspective merits further research
(Valkenburg et al., 2006 ).Holmes (2009) outlined opportunities
provided by socialization online as it leads to increased socialcapital and support and fosters connectedness, thus making itpossible for young people to have possible positive experiences
in the future. Work has also been done on using social media toengage with youth on health related matters ( Byron et al., 2013 ;
Evers et al., 2013 ;Hswen et al., 2013 ;Hausmann et al., 2017 ;
Coyne et al., 2020 ).Swist et al. (2015) and, more recently, Coyne
et al. (2020) acknowledged the link between children ’ss o c i a l
media use and their wellbeing. In their exhaustive review, Swist
et al. (2015) observed that social media impacts children ’s
physical and mental health, identity and relationships,learning and play, and risk and safety, among other aspectsand those positive and negative i mpacts must be seen in context.
On the other hand, Coyne et al. (2020) , in their eight-year
longitudinal study based on the Flourishing Families Project atBrigham Young University, United States revealed thatincreased time spent on social media was not associated withincreased mental health issues and implored research to movebeyond its focus on screen time. This is especially relevant in thecontext of our pandemic world.
Factors In ﬂuencing Learning Environments
Several external factors in ﬂuence how youth engage with social
media. For instance, access to technology, parental involvement,school curricula, and sociopolitical factors in ﬂuence both
formal and informal learning environments. Using socialmedia to enhance education and learning (especially online)(Friedman and Friedman, 2013 ), addressing the ‘digital divide ’
(differential levels of access to digital devices and networksas well as the capacity to use them in productive andmeaningful ways), suggesting media education as a bridge and
the creation of a ‘third space ’as a way to address the divide
(Burn et al., 2010 ), and advising caution in dealing with the
moral panic related to it ( Bennett et al., 2008 ) were the ideas
dealt with in this theme. Other scholars have emphasized onthe need for formal education of students on the professionaluse, design and implementation of social media systems ( Jacobs
et al., 2009 ).
In the realm of parenting, it was noticed that mothers were
likely to give and receive support on social media and use it as aparenting tool ( Duggan et al., 2015 ). Active parental involvement
was detected when the child had experienced online harm
(Kalmus et al., 2015 ). Parenting strategies re ﬂected anxieties
about online risks and inadvertently contributed to limitingchildren ’s opportunities ( Tripp 2011 ). Clearly, a balance needs
to be found between panicking about risks online andopportunities that a digital/social world offers young people. AEuro-American parenting perspective emphasizes independenceand autonomy, and other evidence ( Ho et al., 2008 ;Smetana
2017 ) points towards cultural differences in parenting styles and
its impact on children ’s behavior.Parental mediation was key to in ﬂuencing children ’sb e l i e f sa n d
behaviors ( Gelman et al., 2004 ), thus making the development of
open communication and trust in parent-child relationshipssigniﬁcant to young people ’s wellbeing ( Lee and Chae, 2012 ;
Padilla-Walker et al., 2012 ). This was true in case of media
ranging from television to the Internet ( Livingstone and
Helsper, 2007 ;Clark, 2011 ) and included approaches like
modeling and co-use ( Connell et al., 2015 ;Harrison, 2015 ).
Parental mediation was often categorized into two broad styles:active and restrictive ( Lee and Chae, 2007 )a n d Padilla-Walker
and Coyne (2011) —while accepting this categorization —
characterized it as prearming and cocooning respectively. Theactive/prearming style was a more conversational, open, and trustbased relationship between the parent and child(ren) grounded incommunication, modeling and co-use strategies, whereas a
restrictive/cocooning style was more about rules and restrictions
set by parents for their children to protect them from onlineharms and risks. Livingstone, in her study with Helsper andmore recently in her work with Blum-Ross that extensivelyused interviews with parents, has described parental mediationas active, restrictive, and co-using ( Livingstone and Helsper,
2008 ) and as embrace, balance, and resist ( Livingstone and
Blum-Ross, 2020 ). Livingstone and Blum-Ross also tended to
associate the embrace and resist strategies as potentially riskyin the sense of planning towards the long-term digital futureof young people, favoring balance in a world fraught with
uncertainty.
Beyond Media Literacy Perspectives From
the Global North
While literature reviewed thus far is important for understanding
key themes and factors in ﬂuencing media literacy, digital
citizenship, and social connectedness, it draws almost entirelyon scholarship from the Global North. The paucity in literaturefrom the Global South is only now being remedied. In the case ofIndia, the problem might be partially alleviated by decolonizing
research and the way it is reported, and by building more diverse
networks of scholarship both amongst scholars from within theGlobal South and across regions. Other researchers have arguedfor the need for a global approach to media literacy scholarship ina digital context ( Mihailidis, 2012 ;Byrne et al., 2016 ;De Abreu
et al., 2016 ;De Abreu et al., 2017 ).
Despite acknowledgement of the need to diversify and
internationalize media literacy scholarship, most often it isdiscussed within the context of non-United States Westerncountries in the Global North rather than including countriesand contexts from other parts of the world. Consequently, there
are productive and active collaborations across Europe (fuelled
partly by European Research Council grants) and trans-Atlanticpartnerships. In other words, such internationalization efforts tomedia literacy scholarship often end up unintentionallyreinforcing Euro-centric notions of media literacy constructedand perceived through a Western lens. We need to widen thisview, which situates media literacy as originating from theUnited States, Canada, and Britain, to acknowledge multiplesociocultural locations from which knowledge about literacies
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 4Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiaand media technologies have evolved and continue to evolve. It is
important to further complicate and challenge the dominantEurocentric narrative given the diverse nature of communitieseven in the geographic region that falls into the “Global North ”,
due to historical and contemporary migrations.
Examining central issues in non-Western contexts, Mihailidis
(2009) discovered that ﬁnding support for media literacy work
among decision-makers and policymakers is often a challenge.Several media literacy educators in the Global South continue todraw on curricula developed in United States and Europeancontexts, and stemming from Western models of mediaeducation and a certain cultural understanding of childhood.These curricula tend to focus on democratic practice, freedom ofexpression, and advertising literacies, which might not necessarilybe relevant in all contexts. Additionally, there are other challenges
in terms of building collaborations across various sectors focusing
on children and media such as government, nonpro ﬁts, industry,
and education. A respondent from the Middle East interviewedby Mihailidis cited in his study (2009, p. 14) said, “Media literacy
is about more than just analyzing media messages, and a barrierto entry in the public school system is that there are manydifferent of ﬁcial bodies who believe they should have a say in
the implementation (of media literacy curricula) ”.
Ramasubramanian and Yadlin-Segal (2017) conducted
interviews with scholars and educators from various youth andmedia contexts from around the world to bring to light cultural
differences in de ﬁnitions, practices, resources, and policymaking,
which need to be considered in media literacy scholarship. Forinstance, Livingstone and Bulger (2014) discussed cross-cultural
differences between how children in the Global North access theinternet mostly through a computer whereas those from theGlobal South typically access it through mobile phones, with asingle device often being shared among several members of afamily. They pointed to barriers such as lack of access totechnology, teacher training, parental knowledge, andculturally-relevant or locally produced curricular materials inthe Global South. Similarly, a team of researchers ( Byrne et al.,
2016 ) who examined cross-national data from Argentina,
Philippines, Serbia, and South Africa found that childrentypically accessed the internet at home using mobile phones.They also found that children in South Africa and Philippinesengaged in fewer online practices and had a lower level of digitalliteracy compared to those in Argentina and Serbia.
Within Asian contexts, existing research focused on topics
such as ICT adoption, censorship, cybersafety, and more broadlyon protectionism ( Cheung, 2009 ;Lee, 2010 ;AlNajjar, 2019 ). For
example, AlNajjar (2019) found that in the Middle Eastern
context, much of the discourse surrounding youth media use
has focused narrowly on media risks with little attention paid to
the role of digital media in the betterment of self and society.From a conservative Singaporean context, Yue et al. (2019) called
for more research on digital citizenship from the Global South. Intheir focus group discussions with Singaporean youth, they foundthat media literacy skills in ﬂuence negotiations of public opinions
in ways that challenged mainstream ideologies. Similarly, amongyoung Indonesian Muslim women, they found that issues of piety,religious obedience, and ethical entrepreneurship wereemphasized. Patankar et al. (2017) observed the critical need
for digital literacy in a country like India that is diverse in itspopulace and inequalities and described government efforts tomake rural India digitally literate. Focusing on unemployed
women in India, Mukherjee et al., 2019 , examined the impact
of these programs and their perceived value and found theyenabled rural women to get jobs in, for example, BPOs (BusinessProcessing Outsourcing units). Akram and Kumar (2017) offered
a broad view of the positive and negative effects of social media onsociety, while Kumar and Rangaswamy (2013) drew on actor-
network theory to ﬂip notions of piracy and viewing pirated
content, arguing that it fuels media consumption, technologyadoption, and digital literacy.
Examining Digital Citizenship and Social
Connectedness Within Indian Contexts
Media literacy and media literacy education in India began
receiving government attention only in early 2000s withperceptible growth of the internet, both as a driver of theeconomy (with a focus on skills and capacities) and as a spacefor leisure activity and communication, and, perhaps mostimportantly, in relation to children, as a vehicle forinformation and knowledge dissemination and the potential to“democratise ”access to education, especially in the pandemic
context. The discussion on media and children therefore proceeds
on two occasionally intersecting pathways: one is education
through media and the other is education about media (bothproduction and consumption). Our interest in this project is thelatter. In this regard, the National Curriculum Frameworkproposed in 2005 that education in India should be connectedwith knowledge to life outside school which led to theintroduction of a course on media studies for secondarystudents. The Central Institute of Educational Technologyhelped in creating Media Clubs in schools to promote medialiteracy in India in 2009 –2010 up to 2014 –15 (NCERT, 2017 ),
with further records being unavailable. However, their focus was
on media production —as students brought out school
newspapers as part of the Media Club —rather than a critical
engagement with media. State level bodies implemented andexecuted such media literacy and education activities at lowerlevels. These tend to include literacies about media as well asmedia used to develop multiple literacies —thus confounding the
two pathways mentioned above. For instance the GujaratInstitute of Educational Technology, Education Department,Government of Gujarat produced television programmers forteachers and children of 6 –14 years of age ( GIET, 2010 ) on media
literacy. However, it was found that programs were often
broadcast during school hours, when children could not
watch, although some schools scheduled time for viewing inschool and college (for undergraduate students) ( Govindaraju
and Banerjee, 1999 ).
Different state and central boards of education in India also
periodically share guidelines regarding social media usage atschool and to keep stakeholders noti ﬁed of activities that are
encouraged for children ’s learning. But, there appears to be a gap
between research, praxis, and policy in a manner that
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 5Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiacontextualizes existing knowledge, and helps support young
people and carers maximize the bene ﬁts of this digital/social
world even as we take into account nuances of the local. Currentpolicies do not insist on evidence-based decision-making or draw
on experiences and expectations of a wide range of stakeholders,
and clearly, young people ’s voices are not driving them —nor have
they been expected to, in what has largely been a top-down, non-participatory policy process. Similarly, media is quick to offerbasic parenting advice regarding children ’s online practices,
without attention to speci ﬁc circumstances, sometimes forcing
relationships between the latest fad and its adverse effects.
There is a slowly emerging body of interdisciplinary literature
that looks at the need to build critical skills among young peoplein India. These skills will allow them to negotiate a digitallymediated world, in terms of relationships and political and
cultural realities ( Bhatia and Pathak-Shelat, 2017 ). It will also
help children unpack media representations ( Sreenivas, 2011 )a s
their engagement with social media like YouTube and WhatsAppdeepens ( Sarwatay, 2017 ). Examining attitudes towards
advertising literacy among Indian tweens, Trehan (2017)
found low levels of comprehension of persuasive intent,exaggeration, and misinformation but high levels of celebrityrecognition, visual literacy, and a gender divide in terms ofperceived sexual objecti ﬁcation of women in advertising. As
part of a ten-country comparative study of youth and digitalmedia use, Raman and Verghese (2014) observed that political
and civic socialization of urban Indian youth was largely
dependent on social media —a fact that was similar to their
counterparts in most parts of the world. Such scholarship,being guided by the vision of developing an inclusive andmulticultural mindset, will thus ﬁll out the idea of what it
means to be an informed citizen.
The present study adds to the sparse literature on media
literacy from the Global South, especially in terms of the roleof policymakers such as educators, nonpro ﬁt leaders, and
community leaders. It examines how they shape discoursesabout digital citizenship and social connectedness within the
Indian youth and media context. The uncertainties of the
online world have led parents in India to depend on mediadiscourse, digital/social media, teachers, local parentingexperts, digital media experts, and organizations working withchildren for advice on how to deal with young people ’s
experiences online. Questions of access, uses, practices, risksand opportunities are common but many parents lack accessto well-researched answers. Newspapers largely run storiesmotivated by technopanics; there is a generational digitaldivide, and parents often do not model what theypreach —especially when their mediation follows a restrictive
style. They tend to believe that regulation of some kind is a
solution: at the family level by restricting use or accepting onlycertain kinds of access; at the societal level by depending onschools/teachers; or at the institutional level with governmentalbans or board guidelines.
While some parents and teachers cited media literacy as a
possible solution (Sarwatay, 2017), policy and implementation arelacking in this regard. As children (digital natives) might navigatethrough these digital/social worlds differently than their elders,there is confusion about the dos and don ’ts and, while advice is
available, access to parental mediation and communicationstrategies in a digital world is unequal. As more of ourexistence is digitally data ﬁed, citizenship itself is being digitized
but there are myriad issues of how this existence is structured and
designed and how parents can guide young people and learn fromthem as they navigate through these worlds (ideally) together. Thisis why it is important to examine the underlying systems thatenable young people and their parents in these online worlds. Whathelps them dispel notions fuelled by technopanics? Can regulationhelp? What is the role of media literacy? How can socialconnectedness lead to better communication and engagementbetween parents and children and reduce navigation confusion?How do we become digital citizens even as structures and designsare evolving and getting optimized?
METHODS
In this project, we take an ecosystem-based approach tounderstanding digital citizenship and social connectedness inthe Indian context, using a series of in-depth interviews with aselected group of stakeholders. As literature reviewed in the
previous section suggested, informal and formal learning
environments have shaped how youth engaged with digitalcitizenship, how media literacies are practiced, and how socialconnectedness emerged in various contexts. Various types ofcontextual factors such as family environments, school curricula,sociopolitical climate, and technological access in ﬂuenced how
youth used media to connect, learn, and participate in creative,personal, political, and civic activities. Therefore, it is importantto examine the role of stakeholders such as parents, teachers,social workers, children ’s advocates, and others who shape the
media environment for young people.
Several educational and research organizations as well as the
media in India have shown interest in youth and social media andhave considered —in varying levels of detail —how parents and
children navigate experiences online. Speci ﬁc research priorities
have emerged in the Indian context, and, given the relativerecency of such research in the Global South, most often,quantitative methods like surveys (questionnaires andstructured interviews) have been employed, the main target ofthese being teachers and parents. However, little attention hasbeen paid to other in ﬂuencers of youth and media spaces such as
social workers, industry experts, and children ’s advocacy groups,
all of which also in ﬂuence meso-level and macro-level policies
and practices related to digital media literacy.
From the management of technology and innovation
standpoint ( Tsujimoto et al., 2018 ), one of the signi ﬁcant
ecosystems perspectives is the multi-actor network perspective.The actors are government, universities, consumers, ﬁrms,
policymakers, user communities, etc. and they deal with keyvariables like power, regulation, and knowledge, among others.This multi-actor network is but one aspect of the wider ecosystemof connective media theorized by van Dijck (2013) that includes
invisible technical dimensions of online platforms includingbusiness and commerce aspects as well as infrastructures that
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 6Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiaenable and support online activities as well as social and
democratic dimensions ( van Dijck et al., 2019 ). Experts
interviewed in this study are actors in this network ofconnective media who juggle key variables mentioned above toensure balance in business, social, and democratic dimensions ofthe ecosystem. Interviews as a method to map stakeholders andecosystems have been used across several ﬁelds ( Ginige et al.,
2018 ;Raum, 2018 ;Prieto et al., 2019 ;Woods et al., 2019 ) and was
thus the chosen method for this study as well.
There has been some thoughtful dialogue on issues relating to
digital media and children ’s digital lives; however these
discussions tend to happen in rare ﬁed and often disparate
spaces, and have not yet begun to make a dent on policy. Thispaper attempts to understand how key stakeholders understandthese issues, and what they see as key concerns based on theirdeep understanding of the culture, and socioeconomic contexts inwhich Indian children live their varied lives. In-depth personalinterviews were conducted from October to December 2019 (pre-COVID-19 period) in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India withprofessionals working directly and indirectly with young
people and their parents in India in both informal and formal
learning contexts. These individuals collectively represent a groupthat plays a signi ﬁcant role, some as policymakers and others as
key in ﬂuencers of media discourse and interlocutors of media
practice within and outside educational institutions.TABLE 1 | Details about the participants.

Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 7Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in IndiaThe main questions that guided the interviews were:
(1) How do they frame and perceive issues related to young
people ’s media literacy, social connectedness and digital
citizenship?
(2) What insights have they gained through working with
parents and children?
In this paper, we de ﬁne media literacy as young people ’s ability
to safely access and use digital/social media for identity andrelationships, learning and play, and consumer and civicpractices. Social connectedness is characterized as the sense ofbelonging between young people and their adult caregivers in adigital/social world. Digital citizenship is closely tied to the twoconcepts above in the broader context of engaging with the
society around them in a digital/social world.
Local ecosystem mapping through interviews was conducted to
better understand how these experts describe and examine thecurrent scenario in India. The nine experts interviewed are brie ﬂy
described (in Table 1 ) with their relative positioning (in Figure 1 )
along the policy-praxis-research axes. Pseudonyms have been usedto protect their identities.
These stakeholders are either directly or indirectly working
with parents and young people, schools and teachers,international institutions and organizations to become part ofthe ecosystem of connective media through their practice,
research, and/or eventually policy and have their ear to the
ground as to how young people and parents navigate a digital/social media world. They come from a relatively privilegedsection of the Indian society to be in a position to impactpolicy directly or indirectly within their local ecosystem whiletheir work covers people across the socioeconomic spectrum.These experts engaged with the ﬁrst author in semi-structured
interviews around the following topics:
(1) New media (speci ﬁcally the Internet, digital/social media).
(2) Children and media in the local context.
(3) Understanding of existing systems, media discourse around
this topic.
(4) Gaps in research, advocacy, policy, and academia.
Informed consent was obtained from participants at the start,
and a scanned copy of the form was sent to them after completionof the interview. Interviews were recorded, and transcribed.Interviews were conducted in English with conversationsometimes slipping into Hindi or Gujarati. An interestingmethodological side-note is that an application was used totranscribe interviews instantly and while it performed fairly
decently in English, it had trouble recognizing the Indian
accent in some places and failed to transcribe non-Englishspoken words correctly. We had to correct those parts bylistening to the recording and editing the mistakes out. With theexception of two, who were interviewed by phone and emailrespectively due to their strict preference, all interviews took placeat their of ﬁces/homes. Interviews were scheduled after explaining the
purpose, with each lasting between 30 min to 1 h. All participantsremarked on the importance of the topic in current times.The interviews began with broad questions aimed at drawing
out their ideas about digital/social media and their understandingof the local children and media landscape. Across participants,there was a common theme of children and adolescents being
inundated by media messages, the compounding effect of digital/
social media, and increased importance of parenting in thesetimes to safeguard children ’s rights. This led to a deeper dive into
issues they outlined to elicit responses related to existing systems,perceived gaps, media discourse, and possible solutions.Responses to these questions varied, re ﬂecting their different
locations.
The child psychologist focused on the importance of goal
setting and communication, those involved with social mediaspoke about co-use and balanced consumption, experts who dealtin cyber crime took a cautionary stance, and academic and
research experts focused on the need for research and
foregrounding children ’s voices. Many asked why this topic
was chosen, perhaps to place it in loop of the discoursesurrounding these issues. Data from interviews wassupplemented with researchers ’observations, background/
peripheral conversation with experts, and ﬁeld notes, suggesting:
(1) Nearly all interviewees had children and brought some
context from existing experiences or voiced concernsabout anticipated problems.
(2) Solutions cited came from personal experience, peer
discussions, events about digital parenting, and other
professional avenues.
(3) Identi ﬁcation of relevance of this topic and gaps in research,
advocacy, policy, and academia stemmed fromreﬂections above.
While guided by literature, we did not approach data with
preexisting themes and used an inductive approach, allowingthemes to emerge from the data. A semantic approach wasapplied to thematic analysis. The transcripts were coded andthemes were generated as shown below.
FINDINGS
In-depth interviews help participants express themselves andguide the interview, thereby allowing the researcher to rectifyand add to the process and remain open to developing ideasfurther, even seeking new directions and interpretations(Brenner, 2006 ;Glesne, 2011 ). A ﬁrst order of themes from
the interview data was extracted which was further
consolidated into a second order which were the basis of thissection. Analysis was done and quotes were pulled frominterviews to give a layered, detailed context. Issues of child-centered-design, dearth of knowledge about opportunities andrisks of social media among parents, and confusion around howto navigate this digital world were some of the themes thatemerged as interpreted from the interview data. Questionswere raised about children ’s wellbeing, including what parents
could do about this, the possibility of (and the problems with)regulation, and the need to focus on how parents could foster
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 8Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiatrust and a meaningful connection with young people that would
frame their engagement with technology.
Main themes from the interview data are shown in Figure 2 .
Respondents pointed to what they saw as problem areas, such astechnopanics, digital divide, navigation confusion, andtechnology design that was not child-centric, but alsoindicated possible approaches to addressing these issues,through regulation, improved parental engagement, and moreopen communication with all stakeholders. These were groupedinto three broad themes, of media literacy, social connectednessand digital citizenship, roughly corresponding to the themes inthe global scholarship as outlined in an earlier section ofthis paper.
Some experts spoke from a cautionary perspective while others
focused on safeguarding young people ’s interests. ABC was
vehemently against giving social media access to very youngchildren observing that handing over phones to toddlers as abehavioral incentive was a bad idea. She also opined thatteenagers are going through a rough phase in life as it is, andparents need to be extra careful when they observe behavioralchanges in their adolescent children, possibly due to digital/socialmedia. DEF was a big believer in co-using digital/social mediawith children as a strategy to digital parenting. While she or herchild had not faced cyber crime personally, she was wary of
coming across unpleasant or dangerous experiences and felt one
needed to be prepared. Many sessions she organized for hermothers ’club focused on this theme. Her mantras were ‘practice
what you preach ’and ‘precaution is better than cure ’and this
reﬂected throughout the interview. GHI and JKL believed parents
exert a lot of control over children ’s media diets (especially
younger children) and they needed to be aware of the digital/social world to make the right decisions for their wards. They hadidenti ﬁed an acute lack of awareness about several issues likeprivacy, safety, tools to safeguard young people online and hence
organized/participated in events aimed at parents to spread
awareness and aid parental mediation regarding children ’s
technology use.
MNO and PQR had seen many cases of cyber crime and
victimization. They were aware of the level of ignorance related torisks in a digital/social world. They hold frequent workshops andtraining/counseling sessions for young people, victims or high-risk individuals or organizations like corporate and governmententities. While STU ’s work is not directly focused on the impact
of social media on young people, he works on children ’s rights
and capacity building which ties in with awareness and training.VYW strongly believes young people ’s attention span and sleep
are adversely affected and this needs research attention. When
confronted with the argument that young people love to bingewatch, she countered with the nuance of viewership vs.engagement and how the latter is getting more super ﬁcial.
XYZ posited a generational shift in media consumption andengagement patterns. Young people are moving towards avisual medium of expression, however many of them strugglewith communicating verbally, he said. He also mentioned a lackof acknowledgment of personal responsibility for your actions onsocial media and opined how that might contribute to increasingcases of cyberbullying.
Based on these interviews and the researcher ’sﬁeld notes, the
average middle-class school-going urban-based young personwith access to digital/social media would have a full day ’s
routine with school, extracurricular, and other activities in amedia rich and dense environment as follows: Waking up in themorning as the radio is playing, tinkering with the smartphone(usually mom ’s) and television, getting to school while passing by
hoardings and billboards, studying in a class with a smartboard/projector/computer, talking about latest on YouTube/TikTok/

assignments, tuition timings, banter on WhatsApp,FaceTiming/VideoCalling family and friends, and usinglaptop/computer/internet-enabled television/voice assistant for
education and entertainment.
Parents, on the other hand, oscillated between how much
access should be given to young people in this digital/social worldand were occasionally swayed by media discourse ontechnopanics to limit usage leading to tensions in relationshipswith their wards. This gets further complicated when parentscan’t/don ’t/won ’t practice what they preach and young people
call them out on these contradictions. Parents tend to perceivecomputer/laptop use as productive behaviour while television/smartphone use as unproductive behaviour leading todisagreements and disharmony, sometimes leading to
breakdown of trust and communication between the parent
and child.
While the opening questions helped build context regarding
the local realities, speci ﬁc questions as the interviews progressed,
helped identify the following themes.
Technopanics, Digital Divide, and Hypocrisy
Issues of risks and literacy, health and wellbeing, safety (includingbullying, shaming, violence, and sexting), and privacy were raisedby experts who work directly and indirectly with young peopleand parents, schools, organizations, etc. Lack of (digital/social)
media literacy was cited as one of the reasons why most parents
and some young people were concerned regarding their onlineuses, practices, and experiences. Media discourse also added fueltoﬁre as coverage about social media addiction, challenges like
blue whale and momo ( Pednekar, 2017 ), and safety and privacy
issues were sensationalized. However, this is a challenge that canbe met by inculcating media literacy and digital-smart parentingwhich is an uphill climb because we are still battling technopanics,digital divide and hypocrisy. DEF was frank in her admissionwhen she said, “We held a panel discussion recently on ‘digital
media parenting ’...on what should be the role of parents in
today ’s digital media scenario, how do we cut down on screen
time? But, sometimes we act like hypocrites. We ask them[children] not to use it and as parents we use it so it [a partof the panel] focused on how to balance it [screen time]. ”
MNO had the strong opinion that privacy does not exist in a
dataﬁed world. This problem is compounded by a lack of
awareness regarding online safety among majority citizens.PQR concurred when she opined that usually people becomeaware of risks when something untoward happens.
“The new media forms are much more easily accessible than
the other forms of media and they are up to date. However, we
must also note that such media is also plagued by fake news, non
consensual images, revenge porn contents etc. This makes theyoung minds sometimes glued to such media because they mayhave never seen such things and due to adolescent curiosity theymay be more than willing to share such things in groups secretlywhich may increase the humiliation of the victims. ”
To this end, recognizing the need for steering discourse, the
Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) –a national level
board of education in India managed by the Union Governmentand implemented in several public and private schools
throughout the country —issued the ‘Guidelines for Safe and
Effective Use of Internet and Digital Technologies in Schoolsand School Buses ’(2017) including ‘Tips to stay safe on social
networking sites for students ’(p. 4). This serves as a primer for
ideal online behaviour and can guide parents regardingtechnology mediation at home as well.
Experts also insisted that parents need to set aside their
reservations about the digital divide and not being tech-savvyenough. They have to be more digitally/socially clued in so theycould pass on literacy lessons to children. PQR found patterns inlevels of awareness and corresponding styles of parenting indifferent regions of the country. She reported, “...my
organization receives cases from all across India. However, Ican highlight [patterns] from three regions:..Tamil Nadu, West
Bengal and Gujarat, speci ﬁcally. Parenting style may differ as per
the culture of the region. I have seen that compared to Gujaratand West Bengal, Tamil Nadu parents are more aware andstricter when it comes to using of internet and social media bychildren ...Parents may be busy and they may not be able to
monitor children always. Cyber safety issues still remain laggingbehind when it comes to comparing Southern, Western andEastern regions. ”
Clearly, given the diversity and breadth of India, one may ﬁnd
different trends in different regions. She opined that awarenessregarding cyber victimization was higher in South India
compared to West and East India as they seemed to only
spring to action after a crime has been committed. However,it is important to note that preexisting notions regarding adults ’
or children ’s digital/social abilities in ﬂuenced by technopanics or
digital divide will only exacerbate the problem at hand. This getscompounded when parents give out and act on contradictory setsof norms for uses and practices online as children tend to followin the parents ’footsteps.
Navigation Confusion
ABC was of the ﬁrm opinion that digital and social media
technologies do more harm than good for especially young
and impressionable minds that can be swayed by the glamourand glitz of online platforms if a certain opportunity-basedperspective was not built into young people ’s psyche. She
insisted, “It is our responsibility as parents and teachers to
show the younger generation, through our actions, that theseare but tools you use in life after receiving due instruction in howto effectively utilize them for your bene ﬁt becoming ideal digital
citizens. ”
Reﬂecting on her practice as a child psychologist, she gave the
analogy of children being soft as clay and how we can mold them
through our words and actions. She gave the example of a goal
setting exercise and how it is important to ensure children forgeand follow a certain path for themselves. She added, “And, that we
can’t just teach them this by talking about it, we have to show it to
them to avoid navigation confusion. Digital and social media canwork for or against our children ’s positive experiences depending
on how we have shaped their perspective about it. ”
She elaborated how this works by citing a phenomenon she
has come across many times, especially among teenagers,
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 10Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in India“...because they are in the phase where they want to show off.
They want to show that they are something! ‘I have friends. I have
boyfriends. I have done this ...’as a status symbol. So, for
teenagers, I ﬁrmly believe that, in their formative years, if we
get them into the habit of goal setting, then [social] media can be
of good use because then it will serve as a positive in ﬂuence. Like,
when they follow celebrities on social media they will focus onhow Virat Kohli (cricketer) became such a great sportsperson,what does Bill Gates (businessman) say [about becomingsuccessful]. But, if this connection [between goal setting andhow social media is perceived and can be used for our bene ﬁt],
has not been established, then they [teenagers] get into the showoff mode where they try to put up a show of that which doesn ’t
exist! ”
What she is saying can be tied to our existing understanding
that technology is neither good nor bad and it depends on how we
use it. Opportunities and risks exist in a digital/social world justlike they did before and we need tools like goal setting to utilizethe affordances to our advantage. DEF agreed as she ruminatedabout ‘sharenting ’–parents sharing about kids ’lives and their
photos and videos online —as she goes back to issues of hypocrisy
and lack of policies to protect children from online risks. Sheinsisted that we are confusing children when we create socialmedia accounts for infants and then insist they shouldn ’t use
these platforms because they are bad for them. She also attributeda lack of awareness among parents and young people about safely
navigating online to making contradictory and/or restrictive
decisions. She believed cybercrime is hard to face,“Consequences of cybercrime also affect you mentally, so we
must know about online safety precautions. Every school andcollege should have sessions on cybercrime. ”
She mentioned that while guidelines (like the CBSE ones
above) are helpful, we need more to spread awareness andhelp parental mediation of children ’s technology use. This is
because parents in India can sometimes go from one extreme ofsharenting and making accounts for underage children to anotherextreme of announcing blanket bans for adolescents usually based
on academic performance and feedback. This can confuse young
people and raise questions like: How do we navigate in this socialmedia world? What can be the consequences of navigationconfusion? How can we stop negative consequences? Thesewere also some of the questions raised by the stakeholders.The next issue gives us more insight into the genesis of thisnavigation confusion.
Technology and Child-Centered Design
Digital and social media are considered ideal platforms forconnection, communication, and community building.
However, sometimes platforms can alienate people even as we
have a false sense of security from being on the application orwebsite as we take its bene ﬁts for granted. GHI shared how
websites she creates for schools to keep parents clued in onattendance, homework, and performance of students, sometimesfosters a deeper disconnect while maintaining the illusion ofinformation richness. This is where an emphasis on socialconnectedness becomes important. Issues of technology andchild-centered design enable you to have access to (sometimeslarge scale aggregated) data, but you miss out on nuances that are
unique to an individual. She shared, “...there is no
communication between the teacher and the parents.Everything is updated on the website or application; in a way,
technology does lessen the burden, but there is no personal touch.
But it depends on the school as well. I have enrolled my daughterin a school that uses technology [like smart board, WhatsAppgroups] but also believes in personal connection andcommunication. ”
Navigating a digital/social media world also depends on the
intrinsic composition of the platform. JKL who heads an onlinemarketing ﬁrm insisted that a lack of child-centered-design is to
blame for risks faced by young people and added that low levels ofawareness among adults is also problematic. He cited examples ofcyber crimes and cyberbullying and made his case by explaining,
“Online safety is currently not taken too seriously until they
become victims or someone closer [to them] becomes a victimand at that time they surrender [to the situation] and say ‘Oh I
should do that [take precautions]. ’...we are not [a] kids-driven
[society]...like [for e.g.] ﬁnding a restaurant that has kid-friendly
food! You only realize these things when you experience them. ”
GHI insisted that technology is only an enabler and it is our
responsibility to lean toward or away from it to balance thecommunicative aspect of our relationship with and surroundingchildren. She posited that there is a three-way relationshipbetween parents, children and teachers/schools and this triad
is mediated by technology and personal communication. The
child needs to be at the focal point of this triad and technologyshould help, not harm while centering young people in amediated communication design. Social media technologiesrespond to user behaviors; their affordances can be shaped bydeliberate (and informed) patterns of use. We can either createsilos and echo chambers or actively seek multiple perspectives tofoster understanding.
Regulation and Policymaking
Media literacy is often cited as one of the solutions to risks that
new media bring along with its bene ﬁts. However, is it too much
to ask of individuals to be aware of everything and itsrepercussions? Should the industry self-regulate? Should thegovernment bring legislative regulation? VYW agreed that thisproblem needs industry and government involvement and added,“If we give free rein to corporate and media companies they do
what they do and then every time [something new comes out], theindividual or parent has to constantly worry about what new[impact] it will have on me or my kid ...But at the same time
censorship and regulation will always be problematic, right? ”
XYZ, who is also part of a think tank on digital media
platforms, asserted the importance of keeping discourse
around digital and social media and its impact on society aliveand current. He urged, “It’s important to bring experts together to
put forth their ideas and perspectives on how digital and socialmedia is impacting people ’s health and mental wellbeing. Young
people are digital natives and we are witnessing a generationalshift in the way these new media technologies are being used. ”
However, experts pointed that young voices are distinctly
absent in the policymaking process. A possibility in regulation
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 11Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiacould be evidence-based policy and decision-making where
digital natives participate along with older generations.However, currently there is a massive gap between whathappens on ground vs. legislation or even advocacy around
these issues. Illustrative in this regard are recent bans on
TikTok and PUBG, etc. popular platforms, which youngpeople used for identity creation, self-expression, communitybuilding, among others. While current bans are for politicalreasons, earlier bans (due to sensationalist media stories) werelater lifted, only to be reinstated again. Many young people,especially from marginalized backgrounds, used these platformsand these decisions overlooked impact on said audiences/users.
Social Connectedness and Engagement
Social connectedness in a digital/social world depends on our
communication and engagement with and demonstration of it to
our children. ABC emphasized, “[Social] media is absolutely ﬁne
because that ’s the world we live in where everything is digital and
that’s how it ’s going to be and there is nothing to worry about. But
as a parent or educator or school, which direction do you showyour children towards? Do they think [social] media is a resourcefor learning or to show off? ”DEF echoed the sentiment,
“Parenting in a digital and social media world is just like a
coin with two sides...the internet has everything from porn to[tips on] parenting. It is up to us where we draw the line andchoose and tell our kids what is good and bad. Kids are after all
kids and we as parents need to control ourselves and check our
behavior ...practice what we preach. ”
Some experts, though, thought social media for very young
children was a complete no-no. If social media was having a badimpact on teenagers, parents were encouraged to limit/rescindaccess for older children too. Nonetheless, the quantity andquality of social connectedness depends on goal setting as youhelp create a systematic template for children to follow. They havea sense of direction and will most likely ﬁnd ways to optimize
opportunities and disarm risks in this online experience,navigating these social worlds without confusion and with
conﬁdence. ABC added, “Assigning speci ﬁc responsibilities to
and setting goals with/for your children ensures they use theirscreen time wisely. And this needs to start at the young age of twoto two-and-a-half years, because this approach becomes the wayof life as your child becomes a teenager. ”
This becomes easier to do when you share a communicative
and engaging relationship with your children. DEF shared, “I
heard a panel expert say, ‘we should always add ‘co-’in front of
everything we do with our kids like co-play, co-sleep, co-read inthe initial years ’...because we cannot completely shun these new
technologies and their exposure in today ’s world. How long will
you not tell your kid not to use any of the gadgets when you
yourself are using it for hours. ”
This brings an interesting dynamic to notions of trust and
communication between parents and children. Parents can bondwith children over the latest online or do things together likewatch a movie. This helps foster and strengthen socialconnectedness and engagement and is in line with parentalmediation techniques like ‘balance ’(Livingstone and Blum-Ross, 2020 ) where the parent-child relationship is about doing
things together and in moderation.
Parental Involvement: Practice What
Preach
The involvement of parents in children ’s digital/social lives is
crucial towards ensuring young people ’s long term wellbeing. A
healthy relationship must be based on communication and trust.It is important that parents practice what they preach andremember that young people have rights in this digital age justas in other spheres of life. STU, who heads an initiative forchildren ’s rights, reiterated, “Children need guidance regarding
their online practices just as they need guidance in education,sports, career, and life; this is their right and digital citizenship is
becoming an essential in our ever-changing world. ”
VYW recounted that ordinary people use media positively
i.e., using media to enhance life, “...getting new friends, getting
new knowledge, making you aware of something that enrichesyour life, making you feel valued as a citizen: all of these things[enhance life]...[it ’s not unimportant] just because it ’s on new
media. ”
She added that parent-child communication can foster
discipline and moderation in use, chalk up multiple optionsfor activities, and ensure certain minimum hours of sleep foreveryone as essential —something that people are missing out on
these days. Parents and young people could navigate a social
world better by understanding how media literacy, socialconnectedness, and digital citizenship can help them with:
(1) A better sense of links between policy, governance, and
regulation.
(2) Social connectedness and engagement with young people.(3) Practicing what they preach.
There could be many social factors along with emergence of
digital and social media contributing to trends in children ’s uses,
practices, and experiences online. Additionally, as PQR noted,
parenting styles may differ as per the regional culture, and giventhe world we live in, MNO reiterated digital parenting as the needof the hour. We need to understand why and how young peopleuse social media to express and present themselves and focus onopportunities like education and learning to make the best use ofthese platforms.
DISCUSSION
A range of issues such as a lack of child-centered-design, dearth ofknowledge about opportunities and risks of social media, andconfusion about navigating this digital/social world emergedfrom a thematic analysis. Based on these insights, we offerways to think about children ’s wellbeing, how adult caregivers
can maximize children ’s wellbeing, the possibility of and
problems with regulation, and recommendations for parents tofoster trust and meaningful connection with young people to
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 12Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiaframe their engagement with technology, while pointing to
research gaps and directions for future scholarship in India.
In most conceptions of society, children are considered a
group that is vulnerable and in need of protection. This
responsibility to protect and care is placed by society largely
on the shoulders of parents and other adults like teachers,caregivers, etc. and more broadly, on the institutions that playa role in children ’s growth and development. Children have from
their very inception been treated as a special group by law,academia and the market, and in this regard, media studiesare no exception. As our review indicated, scholarship hasbeen equivocal and often polarized regarding children ’s media
(especially digital/social media) access, usage and its moderatingrole in identity formation and social interactions, and, morerecently, on how children develop civic, cultural, and political
ideas and notions of citizenship ( Nolas et al., 2016 ). Concerns
articulated in research and policy circles about children ’s
literacies, rights and parental cautions about appropriate andproductive media use/participation have also been re ﬂected in
mainstream media discourse.
In regard to the ﬁrst concern articulated in this paper, of
identifying research priorities speci ﬁc to the Indian context, these
conversations offer some direction that research could take toinform developing digital media literacy programmers thataddress the fears, anxieties, hopes, and everyday realities ofIndian families. As some of the informants in this study have
suggested, this has led to a multi-pronged yet somewhat
uncoordinated response to managing anxieties and promisesof digital media in relation to children in the Indian context.Across all the themes that emerged, a well conceived medialiteracy effort was seen as pivotal to mitigating risks andfacilitating a positive relationship with media for youngpeople. It is interesting that parents too are seen as importantparticipants in such literacy efforts —both as targets of critical
media literacy programs and as facilitators. This may beparticularly important in the Indian context, as parents ’
experiences with media (both digital and pre-digital) vary
widely depending on socioeconomic and cultural milieu.
This brings us to the second research question we set out to
address: how can such media literacy programmers address thenuanced needs of local cultures while working with existing[often civic] literacy gaps? There is also an important —but in
these conversations a less perceptible —shift from the language of
responsibility to that of rights and participation. In such aframework in the context of India, communication rights arerealized through media literacy —where children discover or are
sensitized to issues of representation and participation in digitaland other media through deliberately thought out literacy
programmers designed bearing in mind the very diverse
contexts that Indian children occupy. Shakuntala Banaji ’s
work, for instance, brings into conversation historical ideasabout children and childhood in India with everyday livedexperiences of children from the margins —drawing from this
the understanding that intervention for and about children mustinvolve children ’s voices and recognition of their agency ( Banaji
2017 ). This perhaps is one way to respond to concerns expressed
by some of the stakeholders around the top-down approach totechnology design as well as the relatively little effort put into
actually involving children in conversations around theirmediated/media lives. Such conversations of course cannotignore the fundamental truth about India —that (as is the case
in other diverse cultures) there is no one group of children that
represents the whole, and that even as we think about policybroadly, there must be room for multiple local variations inapplication.
In recent years, some multilateral agencies such as UNICEF
and UNESCO have attempted to de ﬁne and advocate for
children ’s rights drawing on research-based inputs from
activists and academics, taking forward —to some extent —a
media literacy movement that emerged in the wake of thespread of television. In most of these projects there has beenrecognition that children occupy complex worlds and a shared
understanding of these diverse realities based on rigorous
research must inform policy and programmatic interventions.These have engendered partnerships between developmentagencies and academics, with a slowly increasingrepresentation from the Global South. The Global Kids Onlineproject initiated by UNICEF, the London School of Economicsand Political Science, for instance, while starting off with aEurocentric focus, has now broadened to include a network ofresearchers from 15 countries, India among them. Theinterdisciplinary and international nature of such networksholds promise for a widening of the lens that informs policy
in areas such as education and technology development, both key
to realizing any media literacy agenda. However, what seems to bemissing is the link with the state institutions that allow forinterventional ideas to be supported at scale in sustainable ways.
But no matter where one looks, it is dif ﬁcult to escape the
ambivalence that pervades thinking in the area of children andmedia, and the usefulness of media literacy efforts in the face of arapidly changing, increasingly interconnected world wherechildren —and the adults in their lives —seem to have to
continually recalibrate their ways of being, learning andrelating. While some hail social media developments as
opportunities for children to learn and grow, others fear risks
of exposure to a world we do not fully know and understand(Livingstone and Helsper, 2008 ). There is also the fear of the older
generation (parents, teachers, etc.) of being left behind due totheir lack of understanding and ability of maneuvering thesemedia, as compared to the younger generation which is identi ﬁed
as‘digital natives ’(Burn et al., 2010 ). Some also question the skills
of these natives in navigating the complicated world of socialmedia. Hence, the emergence of literature aroundliteracy —ranging from information literacy to media literacy
and digital literacy to social media literacy —to enable children
and parents to skillfully and safely engage with this virtual
environment ( Buckingham, 2006 ;Bennett et al., 2008 ;
Livingstone 2014 ). All these questions acquire different
nuances and meanings in different cultures, and in India, asperhaps in other transitional societies, they must be consideredagainst a range of social, political, and economic issues. In thedeeply paternalistic and patriarchal family structures, forinstance, how might children ’s autonomy and parental
engagement operate? How might social media use, or device
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 13Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiaownership and control vary across demographic categories?
What in fact might social connectedness or digital citizenshipfor children mean in a context where even adults ﬁnd themselves
multiply disadvantaged and disenfranchised? How does media
literacy then work alongside other urgently required literacies to
empower children and facilitate their growth?
There is no doubt that there is a rich and rapidly growing body
of scholarship on children ’s engagement with digital
technologies, and many convincing arguments for robustmedia literacy programs. While opinions will always range andoften fall into sharply divided buckets, together they open upquestions for future research, some of which are alluded to above.As noted earlier, much of the work that is currently drawn uponby researchers, educators and policy makers and cited hereoriginates from the United States and United Kingdom, to a
lesser extent Europe and Australia. In this review, there was one
study from Saudi Arabia, one on Latino immigrants, with a fewfeaturing sections on Asian countries like China and India. In theIndian context, the authors could only ﬁnd limited industry
research on this topic (from organizations like ASSOCHAM,TCS, etc.), some academic research done by students which cameto the foreground because of local/regional newspaper coverageand a spot of mainstream media work circling around sensationalstories, like underage use, social media crises (such as the BlueWhale game and the more recent #BoisLockerRoom incident)and tips to parents. While issues related to digital media use and
practice comes into public attention during such incidents, there
has been little sustained scholarly engagement that spans thespectrum from educators to media scholars to policy makers toprogram implementers —the full complement of perspectives and
disciplinary knowledge that may be required to make medialiteracy in the country an evidence based project.
In terms of methodology, the larger research projects currently
underway in India are modeled on or directed largely by Westernframeworks —including the Global Kids Online project, which of
course offers room for cultural contextualization. Deeperethnographic engagements that allow for a contextualized
understanding of children ’s media practices, and qualitative
interviews with teachers and parents, would help build a morerobust evidence base that can inform policy. It may be worthwhileto think back on efforts such as Newspapers in Educationprograms that were led by the media industry (recognizingtheir need to build a consumer base among younger readers)and understand how they also served as media literacy efforts, soas to gain some sense of what might work today, and with whatkinds of partners —industry, the state, educational institutions,
and parents. After all, digital media are here to stay, and whetherwe like it or not, we need to make productive use of them, as tools,
as environments, or as interfaces.
Despite the considerable technopanic generated around the
negative aspects of social/digital media like violence, bullying,hate, addiction, and privacy there are also positives, including thepossibility of agentic self representation, productive interactionsand rich relational experiences, increased access to education andlearning opportunities, and even employment. We need moreresearch that looks at the differential ways in which mediapenetration and access might affect children ’s opportunities inthis regard, and how media literacy could be a way to mitigate
some of these issues. There is also a need to consider such issues asyoung people ’s understanding of ethics in the digital world, their
adoption of and thoughts about technologies like virtual reality,
augmented reality and arti ﬁcial intelligence and how they use their
networked self to cross over into adulthood —again, all within the
cultural contexts of India. For instance, how might we understandethical decision-making within the framework of a religiouscommunity? What forms does bullying take online wherestudents of diverse backgrounds might be interacting —and can
the lessons from race-based discrimination stand in for caste-based discrimination in India? How can children activate theiragency through and with digital media? The example of UNICEF ’s
Children as Media Producers ( CAMP, 2014 ) suggests that
children even in resource poor contexts can engage with media
technology when given a chance, and when equipped with the
right tools of critical literacy. But to build such media literacyprograms one requires the understanding gained from robustresearch, using methods that are appropriate to a particularcontext and the participants who occupy it.
All these issues have gained a new salience in the global
experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its wide-rangingimpact on social life, particularly on children ’s education. As
brieﬂy alluded to earlier, this has brought in a new urgency to the
issue of digital/social media literacy for both children andcaregivers. It also forces us to recognize and address in literacy
programs, the complexities introduced when children need to
learn online, where parental involvement takes on a completelynew texture, and the granularities of lived context (access,connectivity, space, familial structures, and responsibilities)determine the ways in which young people relate not only tothe digital but also to life in general.
The informants in this study offered media literacy as a broad
umbrella approach that could address most of the issues that theythemselves identi ﬁed as problematic in relation to children ’s
engagement with digital media. But they could point to almostno locally generated knowledge that could undergird a culture-
centered approach to media literacy. This then becomes an area
that is ripe for exploration by young scholars in not only mediaand communication but also education, child development,sociology and social policy studies. In other contexts, scholarshave called out the need to decolonize digital culture studies(Risam, 2018 ;Arora, 2019 ); it is important that we begin this
process in relation to media literacy studies as well. Given thatmedia literacy is a “second order ”research area, dependent on
diverse bodies of knowledge including those mentionedpreviously, this would mean that we need to develop creativecollaborations across disciplines and engage not only in extensive
primary research but also actively dialogue across subject borders.
LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSION
This paper is a starting point for more dialogue and support ﬁrst,
for developing a culture-centered approach to understanding coreissues, developing argumentation taking into account multiplesocioeconomic realities, and ultimately, for using media literacy
Frontiers in Human Dynamics | www.frontiersin.org March 2021 | Volume 3 | Article 601239 14Sarwatay et al. Media Literacy in Indiafor active engagement and participation by youth in a pluralistic,
non-Western, democratic context. We acknowledge that a majorlimitation of this study is its dependence on a narrow range ofstakeholders, which gives us only a slight ﬂavor of the range of
opinions and experiences that could inform further research. The
larger project (this data is from) will also bring in additionalinsights from in-depth interviews with children themselves,parents, and educators. Nevertheless, while stakeholderparticipants interviewed were privileged in many ways, theirwork spread across the socioeconomic spectrum which meansthat their views are certainly informed by sensitivity to largerIndian contexts.
Policy formulation in this area, and more importantly
implementation, needs to take a ﬂexible approach that is
sensitive to multiple lived realities of children across India.
Certainly contextual factors like age, gender, family
background, education, income, and rural/urban location feedinto these differences. But this is both the challenge and value ofqualitative research —that while drawing out broad themes likely
to resonate across situations, there is acknowledgment ofvariations therein.
Another limitation is digital learning and social connectedness
have been greatly affected in the pandemic-related lockdown.While this study was conducted pre-COVID-19, future researchmust consider how these relationships affect young people andmedia literacy in India in the context of virtual learning, working
from home, and greater social isolation during the pandemic.
Further research using culture-centered approaches to medialiteracy and digital citizenship are needed within the GlobalSouth, including in India. Additionally, as this study reveals,beyond youth and parents, conducting research on otherstakeholders who shape media and educational policies areimportant to consider within media literacy scholarship inorder to fully understand the various systems, values, andpriorities that shape digital media use by young people.DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

This study evaluated the International Rescue Committe's (IRC's) Fifth Child integrated community 
engagement strategy to improve immunisation coverage in Northern Uganda.
Context
Northern Uganda faces several challenges in meeting the health needs of its population. Maternal and child 
health services, including immunisation, remain weak and have stagnated, with only 73 per cent of children 
receiving the third and final dose of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination (DPT3) (Uganda 
Demographic Health Survey, 2011). This rate has a range of causes, including limited community 
involvement and poor quality data to support decision-making. In early 2015, IRC established Fifth Child: a 
data-informed community engagement strategy to improve the stagnating immunisation coverage in 
northern Uganda.
Research questions
This study addresses the following questions:Does the intervention lead to an increase in DPT3 and 
Measles containing vaccine (MCV) combined immunisation coverage in 12 to 23-month-old children;Is there 
a reduction in vaccination drop-out rates for DPT 1, 2, 3 and oral polio vaccine 1, 2, 3;Will the intervention 
lead to improvements in the timely uptake of immunisations; andHas the intervention increased integrated 
community case management of children aged 6 - 59 months?
Methodology
Intervention design The intervention aimed to enhance community engagement through the use of better 
quality data for target defaulter-tracing using a mobile-health data collection platform called mReach. The 
mReach application aggregated and presented data on the immunisation status of children, which was used 
for tracking those who were due for (or had defaulted from) their scheduled immunisations. Using the 
application, the facility-based health workers downloaded lists of children due for immunisations as well as 
defaulters. These lists were shared with community health volunteers known as Village Health Teams for 
follow-ups during home visits. These data were also shared with community leaders, who were actively co-
managing immunisation outreaches with health workers. A second component of the intervention provided 
logistical support and supervision to health staff in both treatment and control areas for effective delivery of 
immunisation services.Theory of change The theory of change for this intervention hypothesised that data-
driven, targeted community engagement will facilitate more effective defaulter-tracing, contributing to 
increased immunisation coverage in underserved, vulnerable and hard-to-reach communities. The theory of 
change rested on the following assumptions: (1) the intervention would facilitate community co-
management of following up with immunisation defaulters and planning outreaches; (2) the mReach 
platform would improve data quality and provide health workers and community leaders with accurate and 
up-to-date data on immunisation defaulters; and (3) health workers and the Village Health Teams would be 
adequately trained to use the mReach data to conduct effective home visits that would prompt defaulting 
caregivers that are due for immunisation to complete the immunisation schedule of their children on 
time.Evaluation design A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate whether the 
intervention increased coverage of DPT3 and MCV in children 12 to 23 months old. A cluster was defined 
as a health facility catchment area. Thirty-two of these were included; sixteen in the control arm and the 
remaining sixteen were intervention clusters. The sample comprised 55 children in the age group of 9-23 
months per cluster, which brought the total number of children included in this study to 1,760. Cross-
sectional household surveys were used at baseline and endline to measure the impact of the 
intervention.&nbsp;
Main findingsPlease read these findings in light of the limitations detailed below.The study found significant increases in 
DPT3 and MCV coverage rates in both intervention and control (from 68% to 77%) groups. In the 
intervention group, coverage increased from 65% to 76%, while in the control group coverage increased 
from 68% to 77%. However, the difference between intervention and control at endline was not 
significant.The mReach platform was designed to allow Village Health Teams to easily identify defaulters 
and perform targeted outreach. However, the results showed no difference between intervention and control 
groups in exposure to household visits or the actions taken by caregivers after such visits.The intervention 
appeared to have no effect on the timeliness of vaccinations, as there was no significant difference between 
treatment and control groups at endline for timely receipt of DPT3 and MCV.Use of the platform proved 
challenging for some healthcare workers, who did not initially find the application straightforward. Additional 
training and supervision from IRC staff and an mHealth specialist were required to ensure proper use of the 
application.Caregivers had positive views towards the involvement of community leaders in supporting 
immunisation, particularly the community leaders' ability to disseminate information to community members 
and to influence behaviour.All health workers in both treatment and control sites received immunisation 
update training from IRC and district leaders, which may have increased attention to immunisation services 
and improved coverage at study sites. Vaccine stock-outs were found to be common across all study 
sites.Limitations of the study The study has several major limitations, largely stemming from contamination 
between intervention and control groups. Some control sites implemented defaulter tracing systems that 
were similar to that provided by the mReach platform in intervention sites (albeit paper-based). In addition, 
some health workers were transferred from intervention to control sites during the course of the intervention. 
Thus, there is limited basis for drawing inferences about the causal impact of the intervention. Also, different 
measures of immunisation coverage showed different results: reported coverage based on administrative 
records (i.e., immunisation cards) showed marked improvement while coverage based on caregiver self-
report showed no increase. Thus, it is possible that the overall increase in recorded coverage resulted only 
from improvements in administrative tracking.&nbsp;

Factors Influencing the Use of Digital Libraries
in Distance Education in Ghana
https://doi.org/10.1515/libri-2017-0033
Received May 9, 2017; accepted August 23, 2017
Abstract : The purpose of this study was to explore the
extent to which individual factors such as academic
tasks, preference for print sources and information skills
influence distance learners ’use of digital libraries in a
teacher distance education programme at the University
of Education, Winneba in Ghana. The population of the
study consisted of 1,834 distance students and from a
sample size of 641 distance learners spread across three
distance study centers, namely, Winneba (247), Kumasi
(276) and Asante-Mampong (118). A total of 453 (70.67
percent) distance learners, selected randomly, completed
a 31-item questionnaire. In addition, 30 distance educa-
tion tutors, four coordinators and four librarians were
purposively selected to participate in the study. The find-
ings showed that academic tasks of distance learners did
not require them to use digital library resources, which
resulted in low or no academic use of digital libraries.
The findings also pointed to a high preference for print
resources among distance learners which resulted in the
low use of digital library resources. Finally, it was noted
that even though most of the distance learners possessed
basic ICT skills, this did not result in their of use of digital
library resources. To improve digital library use in dis-
tance education, it is recommended that academic librar-
ians seek and foster collaboration in teaching
information literacy and library instruction in distance
education, an approach which must be backed by a
policy that mandates the use of (digital) library scholarly
resources in teaching and learning in distance education.
It is also recommended that the Centre for Distance
Education and the University Library collaborate to offer
training programmes in specific digital resources and
general information literacy courses for all distanceeducation stakeholders in the university to boost digital
library use.
Keywords : digital libraries, distance learners, information
skills, Ghana
Introduction
Higher education institutions in Ghana have significantly
expanded their academic programmes through distance
education, leading to an unprecedented rise in student
populations. At the same time, many have raised con-
cerns over the quality of teaching and learning in the
whole educational system, particularly with the emer-
gence of distance education as a major new trend in the
higher education sector. Distance education provides
teaching and learning facilities in the non-traditional
mode and when effective involves the provision of paral-
lel academic and non-academic learner support, such as
library services to distance learners (Alfrih 2010).
Furthermore, academic libraries in Ghana, like their
counterparts in the developed world, have taken advan-
tage of advances in Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) to implement digital library services to
extend their services beyond the boundaries of the phy-
sical library for the benefit of both on-campus and dis-
tance learners.
Digital libraries have a considerable positive impact
on education, as they enable sharing of learning
resources in support of not only distance education but
also on-campus and independent discovery-based learn-
ing (Fox, Gonçalves, and Kipp 2002). The growth in the
development of digital libraries is attributable to an
increasing realisation of the importance of lifelong learn-
ing and the move towards student-centredness. This ris-
ing phenomenon has resulted in the recognition that
digital libraries are crucial in providing access to much
needed digital information resources (Tedd and Large
2005, 14). Digital libraries can be considered appropri-
ately as powerful resources that can provide new oppor-
tunities to engage students in learning (Shih et al. 2011).
They can enhance learning among distance learners by
promoting access to resources that encourage students to
investigate authentic scientific questions using real data,*Corresponding author: Antonio Rodrigues, Department of

Previous studies explored distance learners ’use of
technology generally and in open distance learning con-
texts where technology is seen as essential to distance
learning (Diaz 2012; Martey 2004; Poellhuber et al. 2013).
In other studies, the use of open Internet resources by
distance learners and their general information behaviour
were the focus (Ng 2013; Oladokun 2010a; Oladokun
2010b, 2014), however in most studies the attention has
been on general provision of library services to distance
learners through several models (Abdelrahman 2012;
Brooke, McKinney, and Donoghue 2013; Diaz 2012; Hill,
Li, and Macheak 2013; Okello ‐Obura 2010). To a large
extent, most of these studies have focused much on the
design and usability aspects of digital libraries to the
detriment of individual factors, however a notable study
that explored individual factors influencing the use of
digital library resources was conducted more than 10
years ago by Liu and Yang (2004).
The value of this article is the insight it provides into
the individual factors that promote the use of academic
library digital resources in a distance education pro-
gramme that makes use of a hybrid delivery approach
(print and online) (Owusu-Mensah, Anyan, and Denkyi
2015). This article is part of a larger study designed to
understand the use of digital libraries in a distance edu-
cation programme for teachers in Ghana. The findings
from this article will, hopefully, be useful to academic
librarians in distance education institutions, distance
education planners and distance learners.
Background
The setting of this study is a large dual-mode, multi-cam-
pus public university in Ghana, the University of
Education, Winneba. The University comprises a main
campus (Winneba), three satellite campuses (Kumasi,
Mampong and Ajumako) and 33 distance learning centres
across the ten regions of Ghana (UEW Diary 2017). It is one
of the largest teacher education universities in Africa with
a total student population of 57,000 (UEW Diary 2017). As
a result of its focus on teacher education, it employs
distance education as a major strategy to upgrade and
train both under-qualified and unqualified teachers.
Teacher distance education at the undergraduate
level in this university employs both the print and elec-
tronic media. Distance learners at the university arerequired to attend tutorial sessions at the end of every
month in their study centres with a course tutor, while
printed course modules are supplied to distance educa-
tion students to enable independent study. The day-to-
day administration of the centres is the responsibility of
the centre coordinator who ensures that essential support
services such as library services are provided to students
(University of Education, Winneba Website 2015).
Developments in the world of technology have given
rise to massive developments in digital libraries, which
often pose identity or definitional challenges. A number
of theoretical and practical definitions of the concept of
the digital library have been proffered in Calhoun (2014,
21–23), with the definitions making it obvious that the
digital library field is very dynamic and increasingly
evolving. The digital libra ry in this study is described
as a virtual library that provides integrated access to the
services and digital collections of the library for the
academic community. The UEW Library supports dis-
tance education with the provision of digital library
resources and services which include open access scho-
larly resources, subscription online bibliographic and
full-text databases, an online public access catalogue
(OPAC) and an online institutional repository. Access
to subscription digital resources is provided through
Intranet and a proxy server which ensure that on-cam-
pus users are able to access resources through an
Internet Protocol, whereas distance (off-campus) users
are able to access through an authorized log-in system.
These resources significantly complement information
provision in the virtual learning space and if integrated
into the distance education curriculum can contribute to
achieving teaching and learning outcomes (Sander et al.
2006).
Statement of the Problem
Distance learners are expected to make use of digital
library services to bridge the digital divide (Henning
2010). However, in spite of the obvious advantages of
digital libraries in distance education, a number of stu-
dies suggest that distance learners in developing con-
texts, especially Africa, are still dependent on print
sources (Larson and Owusu-Acheaw 2016; Oladokun
2010b). As a result, distance learners in these contexts
lose the benefits of quality digital information that can
significantly enrich and enhance their learning.

support to every member of the academic community,126 Christopher M. Owusu-Ansah et al.: Factors Influencing the Use of Digital Libraries

Download Date | 6/10/18 5:40 AMacademic librarians are seeking ways to encourage the
use of digital library services in distance education. The
question of what factors influence the use of digital
libraries in a largely print-mode distance education pro-
gramme becomes more critical. Even though factors such
as ease of use, usefulness, flow experience and environ-
mental elements are believed to influence digital library
use and information seeking (Joo and Choi 2016; Liu and
Yang 2004; Zha et al. 2015), the purpose of this study was
to explore the individual factors that have the potential to
influence distance learners ’use of digital libraries. These
include the academic tasks of students, preference for
print resources and information skills training of distance
learners. Consequently, this article seeks to answer the
following research questions:
1. To what extent do academic tasks influence the use
of digital libraries by distance learners?
2. To what extent does the use of print sources influ-
ence the use of digital libraries by distance learners?
3. To what extent does information skills training influ-
ence the use of digital libraries in the distance educa-
tion programme?
The Role of Individual Factors
in Digital Library Use
Digital libraries have been developed in many academic
libraries worldwide. Despite the increasing availability of
digital resources in academic libraries, a number of fac-
tors conspire against the use of digital library resources
in distance education. Some of these are the relevance of
digital library resources to academic work in distance
education, preference for print resources and poor or
inadequate information skills of distance learners.
Academic tasks have been found to influence dis-
tance learners ’attitudes toward the usage or non-usage
of digital library resources and services. Damilola (2013)
found that 165 (66 percent) of distance learners reported
using electronic resources for various purposes such as
knowledge acquisition (29.2 percent), information
exchange (29.2 percent) and writing academic projects
(6.4 percent). In a follow-up question, their findings
also showed that most distance learners (42.8 percent)
were motivated to use electronic resources for “informa-
tion facilitation ”, enhancement of quality of academic
work (42.8 percent) and enhancement of research activ-
ity. Omotosho et al. (2015) confirm that distance learners
make use of ICT resources in their course work,assignments, group discussions and for information shar-
ing at the National Open University of Nigeria.
Furthermore, requiring students to use digital library
resources in their academic work can promote the use of
digital library resources (Huwiler 2016). In a study of the
information-seeking behaviour of distance education
graduate students at the Kent State University, Clark
(2014) found that most students were aware of available
digital resources. Specifically, 100 percent of the respon-
dents indicated their awareness of digital library
resources and that they had actually used journal data-
bases and full-text resources while 83 percent of the
students were aware of online reference databases, of
which 72 percent had actually used them as this was a
course requirement. On the contrary, other digital ser-
vices and resources such as the book delivery programme
was low on awareness (41 percent) and use (35 percent)
as there was no such requirement to use these for aca-
demic purposes. Natalee (2013) confirms that the use of e-
books increases when specifically prescribed by aca-
demic advisers to support online instruction.
Distance learners ’preference for the print format has
also been identified as a major factor for the lack of use of
digital library resources in distance education. Natalee
(2013) found that most distance learners at the Northern
Caribbean University prefer to use print formats of both
books and journals as opposed to electronic resources.
Explaining further, she reports that 42 percent of users
usually print out relevant pages of electronic journals or
books if they required further reading. The author is, there-
fore, of the view that libraries must provide both print and
electronic formats for all library users. This finding is,
however, at odds with other reports where preference for
print-based resources is not necessarily for convenience
but a manifestation of the challenges of integrating digital
resources into the curriculum. In a study to determine the
information-seeking behaviour of two categories of dis-
tance learners in Botswana, Oladokun (2010a) found that
distance learners rely heavily on their study packages and
modules (93.7 percent) which are print-based resources,
while the Internet (65.4 percent) and colleagues (62.9 per-
cent) were reported as being other preferred sources of
information for distance learners. Interestingly, only a
few (8.8 percent) indicated their preference for consulting
a subject librarian and by implication using any library-
based resource such as digital library resources. This result
is rarely surprising as the research setting of Botswana is a
developing country where challenges with Internet access,
high cost of broadband and unreliable power supply,
among others, are barriers to the use of digital information
(Alemna and Cobblah 2005).Christopher M. Owusu-Ansah et al.: Factors Influencing the Use of Digital Libraries 127

Download Date | 6/10/18 5:40 AMIn spite of the numerous resources available to enhance
access to quality information, distance learners ’preference
for the information source is usually not the library nor its
digital resources. A study by Oladokun (2010b) in Botswana
on the information-seeking behaviour of distance learners
indicates that books (90 percent) and lecturers (71.3 per-
cent) were the most predominant sources of information
used by distance learners. Again, the study sought to iden-
tify, through another follow-up question, the most valuable
information sources to students, who indicated their pre-
ference for books (45 percent) and lecturers (33.8 percent)
as most important. The author, however, clarifies that the
choice of “books ”as the most valuable information source
was related to their choice of the print format (study mod-
ules or packages) (71.3 percent) for their academic work and
not library textbooks as it may be assumed: the study also
found no preference at all for Internet resources among
distance learners for their academic work. The findings
from these studies seem to suggest that electronic resources
may not be preferred where the educational system does
not deliberately integrate electronic resources into teaching
and learning. In attempting to explain students ’dissatisfac-
tion with Internet resources, Oladokun (2010b) points out
that the students either lacked awareness of how to effec-
tively use Internet resources or lacked access to quality
educational digital libraries.
Training and skills acquisition are important aspects
in digital library development (Lighthart and Spreder
2014). In recognition of the critical role of lifelong learning
skills as a critical outcome of distance education, informa-
tion literacy has been used to promote the use of relevant
resources such as digital library services. The Association
of College and Research Libraries ’(ACRL) (2011) standards
for imparting information literacy skills has become an
important basis for institutions interested in promoting
lifelong learning among their students and other stake-
holders. Information literacy programmes are generally
expected to help users make effective and efficient use of
the information and information services offered by the
academic library (Mnkeni-Suarombe 2014). Information
literacy is now recognised by both educators and librar-
ians in distance education as a critical success factor in
teaching and learning (Moghaddam and Fard 2014).
Several strategies have been adopted by different
institutions to teach information literacy. In some institu-
tions, information literacy is implemented as an indepen-
dent course and in others integrated into the curriculum:
according to Bell (2008) these major strategies to deliver-
ing information literacy can be described as “compart-
mentalised ”or “distributed ”. The compartmentalised
model refers to standalone information literacy coursesthat may or may not attract credits. On the other hand,
the distributed model pertains to the approach of deliver-
ing information literacy where courses are integrated in
individual courses throughout the curriculum (Bell 2008;
cited in Gontshi and Owusu-Ansah 2015).
Jiyane and Onyancha (2010) examined information
science teaching departments (LIS) and academic
libraries in selected South African universities offering
information literacy programmes and identified that
most LIS departments were integrating information lit-
eracy within the several individual courses and most
were credit-bearing formal modules. On the other hand,
academic libraries offering information literacy courses
indicated they offered the courses as non-formal instruc-
tional programmes with emphasis on user education,
computer skills and library orientation. Both of the stra-
tegies have strengths and weaknesses: Jiyane and
Onyancha (2010) opine that integration may be counter-
productive as the subjects in which information literacy is
embedded may overshadow and dissipate the impact of
information literacy. Noting the benefits of integrating
information literacy within the curriculum, however,
Harrison and Rourke (2006) argue that integration
enables students to achieve advanced information lit-
eracy skills in the long-term by embedding information
literacy outcomes at the individual course level.
Whatever strategy is used in teaching information
literacy, Moghaddam and Fard (2014) believe that dis-
tance students choose distance education precisely for
its flexibility, meaning that supportive services should
offer the same degree of flexibility as much as possible.
As a result, the library community supporting distance
education advocates for alternative “fit-for-purpose ”
models for offering information literacy instruction (van
Brakel and Chisenga 2003). Mnkeni-Suarombe (2014) sup-
ports this view by arguing that information literacy in the
distance education context must be integrated into the
curriculum of distance learners, an action that may be
achieved through collaboration with faculty and other
campus stakeholders (Harrison and Rourke 2006). These
perspectives suggest a need for integrating information
literacy courses into the curriculum of distance learners
and that this will succeed with academic librarians for-
ging collaborations with academic partners.
Research Methodology
This research was conducted with a survey design using a
quantitative approach. The population of the study128 Christopher M. Owusu-Ansah et al.: Factors Influencing the Use of Digital Libraries

Download Date | 6/10/18 5:40 AMconsisted of 1,834 distance education students who were
students of three distance education centres of the
University of Education, Winneba. In addition, the popu-
lation consisted of 30 distance education tutors each
from the three centres, three librarians from the three
centres and the University Librarian as well as the four
distance education coordinators who included the Head
of the Centre for Distance Education and three coordina-
tors from the three distance education centres.
Stratified purposive sampling was an important first
step in fulfilling the study objectives and this was
achieved by purposively sampling three distance educa-
tion centres where there were academic library services.
These centres are located in Winneba, Kumasi as well as
Asante-Mampong and incidentally are the location of
three out of four campuses of the University of
Education, Winneba. The sample size of the student
population was determined by applying the 95 percent
confidence level at a 5 percent confidence interval to
each of the sub-groups in the student population.
A questionnaire instrument was used for the study.
There were, however, two kinds of questionnaires: one
fully-structured questionnaire for distance learners and
two semi-structured questionnaires for the distance educa-
tion tutors and coordinators respectively. The question-
naire instrument was administered for a period of 4
months specifically from the month of March to June
2016. The researcher personally administered the question-
naire for the Kumasi centre which was located on the
Kumasi campus of the University while in the two other
centres colleagues who were staff of libraries in the two
other campuses, namely Asante-Mampong and Winneba,
assisted the researcher in administering the questionnaire.
Data analysis was completed with the current version
of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
Data was presented through graphs (bar charts, histo-
grams and pictograms) and frequency distributions.
Again, the use of cross-tabulation and descriptive statis-
tics combined to establish distance learners ’and tutors ’
attitudes and perceptions towards digital library
resources.
Results of the Analysis
This section presents the findings of the empirical inves-
tigation. This includes the background of the respondents
which involves the study centres of the students, age and
gender composition as well as their levels of study.
Furthermore, findings related to the three research ques-
tions are presented.Background of the Participants
Distance learners were the primary population of the study
and their responses to digital libraries formed the basis of
much of the findings. From a sample population of 641
distance learners spread across the three centres, namely
Winneba (247), Kumasi (276) and Asante-Mampong (118), a
total of 453 distance learners completed the questionnaire,
yielding a response rate of 70.67 percent. Table 1 outlines
the distribution of the centres and distance learners who
participated in the study.
Table 2 presents the total number of participants of dis-
tance learners in the study according to their centres. The
distribution of distance learners among these three cen-
tres demonstrates that the majority (n = 195, 43 %) of the
participants were from the Winneba centre, whereas 181
(40 %) of the learners were located at the Kumasi study
centre and 77 (17 %) were drawn from the Asante-
Mampong centre. The results suggest that participation
of distance learners in the study was higher at the
Winneba study centre than in the other two centres.Table 1: Population of the study.

Distance learners who participated in the study were
expected to indicate their gender and age. Table 3 pre-
sents the gender and age of distance learners who parti-
cipated in the study:
Table 3 presents a cross-tabulation of the gender and age
distribution of the respondents. The results indicate that
females dominated in the study as more than half
(n = 254, 56.1 percent) of the learners were females com-
pared to 199 (43.9 percent) who were males and hence
that there was more female than male participation in the
study. This result suggests that women did not have
equal opportunities of undertaking full-time studies like
their male counterparts, probably because of their role in
attending to family responsibilities.
In relation to the age of distance learners, the study
also found that the majority (n = 262, 57.8 %) of the
respondents were aged between 21 and 30 years.
However, of this age group, there were more females
undertaking distance study (n = 156, 59.2 %) than males
(n = 106, 40.5 %), which can be explained in several
ways. It is clear that the majority of women in this age
group opt for distance education due to its flexible sche-
dule. Meanwhile, one-third (n = 141, 31.1 %) of the respon-
dents indicated they were aged from 31 to 40 years, while
the least represented age group is the 51 –60 year olds
who comprise just 1.5 percent of the total number of
participants, an indication that even though distance
education is preferred by adults the demanding nature
of distance study, it may be a disincentive to older indi-
viduals. It is therefore important that this negative per-
ception of distance education as heavily demanding is
alleviated with support services such as effective library
support in the form of digital library services.In addition to the distance learners ’population all 30
tutors, four coordinators and four librarians who partici-
pated in the study returned validly completed semi-struc-
tured questionnaires, giving a response rate of 100
percent respectively.
Distance Learners ’Levels of Study
Another important variable of distance learners deter-
mined in the study was their levels of study. Awareness
of the levels of study of students may help to determine
their academic information needs which may further
determine their library use and needs. The findings of
the specific level of study of respondents are presented in
Table 4 below.
The outcome of this investigation indicates that more
than half (n = 246, 58 percent) of the respondents were
in their third (3rd) year of study whereas 176 (41.7 per-
cent) were in their fourth (4th) year of study. The results
show that the majority of gender disparities observed in
the data were in their 3rd year.
To What Extent do Academic Tasks Influence
the Use of Digital Libraries by Distance
Learners?
A better approach to assessing learners ’behavioural ten-
dencies towards the use of digital library resources is to find
out the purposes for which they seek to use digital library
resources. Table 5 is a summary of responses of distance
learners ’purposes for using digital library resources.
The results in Table 5 indicate that most learners use
digital library resources during the writing of theirTable 3: Gender and age distribution of distance learners.

n = 184). In addition, other learners reported using digital
resources when working on their assignments (m = 3.87,
n = 184), although it must be pointed out that distance
learners are not given assignments in this programme,
while other groups of distance learners also use digital
library resources when searching for current and general
information (m = 3.91, n = 102). Finally, some of the lear-
ners noted they use digital library resources when pre-
paring lesson plans, evidenced with a mean score of
(m = 4.00, n = 104).
To confirm the responses of the distance learners on
the purposes for which they use digital libraries, the
views of coordinators were obtained. Most of the coordi-
nators were of the view that distance learners use digital
library resources when writing their final year research
projects (m = 2.00, ± SD = 0.14) while some also believed
distance learners use digital resources when writing the-
sis and dissertations (m = 1.50, ± SD = 0.057). The findings
from coordinators support the view that distance learners
predominantly use digital library resources for their pro-
ject work.
In addition, tutors also indicated that distance lear-
ners were required to use digital resources when doing
their research projects (n = 5), whereas two tutors each
indicated essay and reading assignments respectively:
hence, by implication, they revealed that students ’
research work requires use of digital library resources
for information. Four tutors stated that they do not give
their learners assignments, implying the nature of the
distance education programme as one that rarely
encourages the use of library resources including digital
resources. This approach to distance education does not
give opportunities to students to learn to independently
find scholarly information, which is increasingly avail-
able through digital libraries. It is important to note that
there are digital library resources appropriate for alllearning outcomes in the curriculum. From the findings,
it may therefore be deduced that digital library resources
are not used throughout the academic work of distance
learners.
To What Extent Does the Use of Print
Sources Influence the Use of Digital Libraries
by Distance Learners?
In spite of distance learners ’indication of Web-search
engines as their most used digital information resource,
it may not be their best source of academic information
overall. As a follow-up to the previous question, distance
learners were asked to indicate their most preferred
source of information. Table 6 depicts distance learners ’
responses.
A summary of the responses as indicated in Table 6
revealed that Distance Education Modules (m = 2.79,
n = 272) turned up as the most preferred source of infor-
mation by the distance learners. The Internet was ranked
as the second most preferred source of information
(m = 3.10, n = 233), followed by lecture notes (m = 3.60,
n = 164). Library resources (m = 3.89, n = 123) and collea-
gues (m = 3.97, n = 105) were the lowest ranked preferred
choice of sources of information preferred by distance
learners.
These results from the distance learners were con-
firmed by distance education tutors who were asked to
indicate the resources mostly referenced by their learners.
The results suggest that about half (n = 16, 53.3 percent)
of the learners refer to their modules most, whereas 9 (30
percent) of the tutors indicated that their learners refer-
ence textbooks, while 3 (10 percent) of the tutors also
pointed out that their learners reference academic data-
bases. The outcome indicates that distance learners pre-
fer to use printed modules and textbooks as their mainTable 5: The purpose for which distance learners use digital library

To What Extent Does Information Skills
Training Influence the Use of Digital
Libraries in the Distance Education
Programme?
The aim of this research question was to find out how
information skills training improves the confidence
and competencies of students in using digital resources.
Table 7 includes the kinds of training students have
received to improve their information skills.
Results in Table 7 shows that whereas 228 students
(50.3 percent) reported receiving training in internet search-
ing, 131 (28.9 percent) had received training on electronic
databases, with library user education the least amount of
training received (122 = 26.9 percent). On the other hand, as
many as 279 students (61.6 percent) reported not being
trained in the use of electronic databases.
These findings from the students were confirmed by all
four coordinators of the distance education programme,
that distance learners are provided ICT skills training in
their centres. In explaining the nature of this training,
some coordinators said that “the ICT courses are run for
all students of the university, whether it is a distance
student or full-time student ”. Elsewhere, when discussing
the types of specific topics included in the training, one
coordinator remarked that “the students offer courses in
ICT tutorial and Microsoft applications ”. In addition, with
librarians ’admission that they do not engage withdistance learners, it can be assumed that the 28.9 percent
of students who reported being trained in electronic data-
bases were either not being truthful or had prior training
from elsewhere.
Discussions of Findings
This section is a discussion of the findings of the study in
relation to the research questions and the extant litera-
ture. The discussion is in order of the influence of aca-
demic tasks, print resources and information skills on the
use of digital library resources in distance education.
Influence of Academic Tasks on the
Use of Digital Library Services
In respect of whether or not academic tasks influence the
use of digital library resources, the study found that the
academic tasks of distance learners are not connected to
the use of library resources. Furthermore, tutors ’and
coordinators ’perspectives of distance learners ’purposes
for using digital libraries reveal that distance learners are
not required to use digital library resources in their learn-
ing activities. Our study ’s finding affirms that of Larson
and Owusu-Acheaw (2016) who found that distance lear-
ners of the University of Education, Winneba (Winneba
Study Centre) did not make use of library resources in
their academic work. This result is, however, in contrast
to Tury, Robinson, and Bawden (2015) who found in their
study that distance learners ’use of library resources were
task-based, with the majority of their respondents requir-
ing library information sources in preparing for their
exams, completing assignments or course work. Linking
resources to academic tasks is considered a critical factor
for students ’intention to use digital library resources (Joo
and Choi 2015). According to Joo and Choi (2015), stu-
dents must be encouraged by their academic mentors,
including their professors, to use library resources by
demonstrating to them the value of these resources.
Even though digital library resources are useful for a
variety of purposes, its superior value for learning must
be emphasised, which will be achieved through the appli-
cation of new pedagogical methods such as promoting
inquiry-based learning through the rich sources of the
digital library (Sharifabadi 2006). A number of authors
are of the view that students ’use of library resources can
only be improved through collaboration with academicTable 7: Training in digital library resources.

into the curriculum and indicating how academic
tasks are linked to library resources (Joo and Choi 2015,
2016; Sullo et al. 2012; Tang and Tseng 2016).
Influence of Print Sources on the
Use of Digital Library Services
In terms of the information format preferences of distance
learners, the study found that most of the distance lear-
ners preferred information sources in print, a result
which is supported in the literature (Mizrachi 2016;
Oladokun 2010b) (Oladokun found that most (71.3 per-
cent) distance learners in his study preferred the print
format). In exploring reasons for these preferences,
Mizrachi (2016) attributes students ’preference for print
resources to the less distractive nature of books and the
efficiency of books for academic reading, while it can
also be surmised that distance learners in the study are
more familiar with print sources than with digital
sources. Joo and Choi (2015) also found that familiarity
with resources plays a significant role in students ’inten-
tion to use digital library resources. Even though Joo and
Choi were concerned with librarians designing library
interfaces that were compatible with students ’existing
preferences, it can be understood that students prefer
print sources in a library for extensive studying purposes
and so it is prudent for librarians to ensure that digital
libraries provide facilities make it possible to access print
resources. Mizrachi (2016) avers that librarians should
provide print versions of digital resources which often
require extensive focused reading, which distance lear-
ners may access through innovative document delivery
services such as OPACS (Diaz 2012) and in-person
requests. Better still, the provision of superior e-book
readers may attract distance learners to use digital
libraries (Vasileiou, Rowley, and Hartley 2012).
Influence of Information Skills on
the Use of Digital Library Services
Distance learners require constant training in digital
library resources since these are not usually one of the
academic resources students use. Findings on the kinds
of training received in digital library use were important
to understand students ’present attitude to digitalresources. In respect of this, the findings revealed that
in terms of training, most of them had not received any
library user education (53.2 percent) and training on the
use of electronic databases (61.6 percent), while 26.9
percent and 28.9 percent claimed to have received train-
ing in library use and electronic resources respectively.
On the other hand, most distance learners (50.3 percent)
reported being trained in Internet searching, while
another 39.3 percent claimed not being trained in this
area. The results on library use training and electronic
resources from distance learners ’points of view are a
reflection of librarians ’responses on training of distance
learners. Librarians who were interviewed indicated that
they had no training programme for distance learners,
their tutors and coordinators, while distance education
coordinators also provided a rationale to some of the
findings. In their responses on training, all four coordi-
nators revealed that ICT training was offered at their
centers. All first-year students in the university are
offered a general ICT course also available to distance
learners, suggesting movement in the right direction for
information literacy as a course to be taught to distance
learners as well to enhance their skills in using digital
libraries. Oladokun (2010a) supports this view by reveal-
ing that computer and information literacy are compul-
sory courses for all first-year distance students in two
satellite campuses in Botswana.
Conclusion and Recommendations

findings of a large study which examined the use of
digital libraries in a teacher distance education pro-
gramme. This particular article focuses on individual
factors influencing the use of digital libraries by dis-
tance learners at the University of Education, Winneba
in Ghana. The study found that the academic tasks of
distance learners in the study did not require them to
use digital library resources: furthermore, it was dis-
covered that the high preference for print resources
among distance learners resulted in low patronage of
digital library resources as distance learners find print
sources more convenient to use. Finally, the study
found that most distance learners had not received
any training on the use of digital library resources
and this negatively affected t heir use of digital library
resources.

useful to distance learners. It is, therefore, recommended
that academic librarians seek and foster collaboration in
teaching information literacy and library instruction in
distance education. The aim of this collaboration is to
integrate information literacy across the curriculum and
be partners in the classroom, which must be backed by a
policy requiring the use of (digital) library information
resources in teaching and learning in distance education.
This policy must be developed by the academic library
and distance education authorities and submitted to uni-
versity authorities subsequently. The goal of this policy
may be achieved through collaboration between librar-
ians, distance education authorities and other stake-
holders in developing new teaching and learning
strategies that foster independent learning.
Again, it must be recognised that the provision of
skills and training go hand in hand with the effective
use of technological tools. Digital library managers must
collaborate with distance education administrators and
faculty to design training programmes for students and
faculty in distance education. Following this stage, three
major training methods may be used for training distance
learners in digital library resources. The first is a stand-
alone, separate and compulsory university-approved
information literacy course which will, among other
topics, introduce students to the range of digital library
resources available in the library (this course will also be
available for full-time first year students of the univer-
sity). In addition, teaching librarians will be expected to
demonstrate practically how to use these resources in
their scholarly activities. Secondly, we recommend a digi-
tal resource-specific training programme which will be in
the form of a workshop or seminar for distance learners
on a regular basis, for instance once every semester.
Lastly, online information literacy tutorials, with specific
focus on digital resources and how to use them, may be
provided on the library website with links to the learning
management system used by students of the university to
enhance and promote lifelong learning and independent
self-paced learning.

BACKGROUND
The agriculture and food sector is facing multiple 
challenges. With the global population projected to grow 
from 7.6 billion in 2018 (UN DESA, 2019) to over 9.6 
billion in 2050 there will be a significant increase in the 
demand for food (UN DESA, 2017). At the same time, 
the availability of natural resources such as fresh water 
and productive arable land is becoming increasingly 
constrained. 
Production is not the only concern; although agricultural 
output is currently enough to feed the world, 821 million 
people still suffer from hunger (FAO, 2018). Processes 
such as the rapid rate of urbanization are also having 
important implications for patterns of food production 
and consumption.
The agrifood sector remains critical for livelihoods 
and employment. There are more than 570 million 
smallholder farms worldwide (Lowder et al., 2016) and 
agriculture and food production accounts for 28% of the 
entire global workforce (ILOSTAT, 2019).
Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goal of 
a ‘world with zero hunger’ by 2030 will require more 
productive, efficient, sustainable, inclusive, transparent 
and resilient food systems (FAO, 2017b p. 140). This will 
require an urgent transformation of the current agrifood 
system.
Digital innovations and technologies may be part of the 
solution. The so-called ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’ 
(Industry 4.0)1 is seeing several sectors rapidly 
transformed by ‘disruptive’ digital technologies such as 
Blockchain, Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and 
Immerse Reality. In the agriculture and food sector, the 
spread of mobile technologies, remote-sensing services 
and distributed computing are already improving 
smallholders’ access to information, inputs, market, 
1 The term Industry 4.0 originated in Germany where it was applied 
to rapid transformations in the design, manufacture, operation 
and service of manufacturing systems and products (European 
Parliament, 2015a)finance and training. Digital technologies are creating 
new opportunities to integrate smallholders in a digitally-
driven agrifood system (USAID, 2018). 
The next period of growth in mobile connections is 
expected to come mainly from rural communities. Already, 
70% of the poorest 20% in developing countries have 
access to mobile phones (World Bank, 2016). Additionally, 
more than 40% of the global population has internet access 
and there are major initiatives to connect those in rural 
areas of developing countries (World Bank, 2016).
However, there are challenges to consider in the 
‘digitalization’ of agriculture and food value chain. The 
transformation must be done carefully in order to avoid 
an increase of a ‘digital divide’ between economies 
and sectors and between those with differing abilities 
to adopt new technologies (OECD, nd). In emerging 
economies and rural areas, weak technological 
infrastructure, high costs of technology, low levels of 
e-literacy and digital skills, weak regulatory framework 
and limited access to services mean these areas risk being 
left behind in the digitalization process.
Yet, developing economies may also have the advantage 
of being able to ‘leapfrog’ older agrifood technologies and 
models in favour of a digital agriculture revolution. This 
new scenario will require radical rethinking by policy 
makers, international organizations, business leaders and 
individuals: ‘business as usual’ is not the solution.
1.1 The digital agriculture 
revolution
Historically, agriculture has undergone a series of 
revolutions that have driven efficiency, yield and 
profitability to previously unattainable levels. Market 
forecasts for the next decade suggest a ‘digital agricultural 
revolution’ will be the newest shift which could help 
ensure agriculture meets the needs of the global 
population into the future.DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER2Digitalization will change every part of the agrifood 
chain. Management of resources throughout the system 
can become highly optimized, individualized, intelligent 
and anticipatory. It will function in real time in a 
hyper-connected way, driven by data. Value chains will 
become traceable and coordinated at the most detailed 
level whilst different fields, crops and animals can be 
accurately managed to their own optimal prescriptions. 
Digital agriculture will create systems that are highly 
productive, anticipatory and adaptable to changes such as 
those caused by climate change. This, in turn, could lead 
to greater food security, profitability and sustainability.
In the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, 
digital agriculture has the potential to deliver economic 
benefits through increased agricultural productivity, cost 
efficiency and market opportunities, social and cultural 
benefits through increased communication and inclusivity 
and environmental benefits through optimized resource 
use as well as adaptation to climate change.
The potential benefits of digitalizing the agrifood sector 
are convincing but it will require major transformations 
of farming systems, rural economies, communities and 
natural resource management. This will be a challenge 
and requires a systematic and holistic approach to 
achieve the full potential benefits.
1.2 Digital divide
Digitalization of the agrifood system involves the risk 
that the potential benefits will be unequally distributed between rural and urban areas, gender, youth population. 
Urban areas often have better developed ‘digital 
ecosystems’ (resources, skills, networks) compared with 
rural areas. Combined with global trends of urbanization 
and middle and rich classes settling in cities, there is 
potential for digitalization to exacerbate existing rural-
urban disparities (UN DESA, 2018a) and populations to 
fall behind in the process of a digital transformation. FAO 
is committed to assist governments and partners bridging 
such multidisciplinary digital divides to ensure that 
everyone benefits from the emerging digital society.
1.3 Conditions for a digital 
transformation
There are several conditions that will shape the digital 
transformation of agriculture in different contexts:
 zBasic conditions are the minimum conditions 
required to use technology and include: availability, 
connectivity, affordability, ICT in education and 
supportive policies and programmes (e-government) 
for digital strategies;
 zEnabling conditions (‘enablers’) are factors that 
further facilitate the adoption of technologies: use 
of internet, mobile phones and social media, digital 
skills and support for agripreneurial and innovation 
culture (talent development, sprint programmes 
including hackathons, incubators and accelerator 
programmes).32 BASIC CONDITIONS 
FOR DIGITAL 
TRANSFORMATION
There are some basic conditions that must exist for 
the use of digital technologies and therefore for digital 
transformation of the agriculture and food sector. 
These include: infrastructure and connectivity (mobile 
subscriptions, network coverage, internet access, and 
electricity supply), affordability, educational attainment 
(literacy, ICT education) and institutional support.
Access to digital technology can offer significant 
advantages to smallholder farmers and other rural 
business by providing links to suppliers and information 
and allowing users to tap into workforce talent, build 
strategic partnership, access support services such as 
training, finance and legal services and, critically, reach 
markets and customers. 
However, the introduction of digital technologies in 
rural areas can be a challenge. Around the world, 
rural populations are declining and education and 
employment opportunities are limited. There is often a 
lack of infrastructure, including basic IT infrastructure, 
particularly in very remote rural communities and those 
with large indigenous populations. The costs associated 
with IT infrastructure present a major challenge in rural 
areas where rates of poverty are often high, especially 
in developing countries and least-developed countries 
(LDCs). 
2.1 IT infrastructure and 
networks in rural areas
In the era of digitalization, Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICT) such as mobile 
phones and computers have revolutionized how people 
access knowledge and information, do business and use 
services. Yet there remain significant digital divides both 
within and between countries (European Parliament, 
2015b).2.1.1  CHALLENGES
Globally, mobile cellular subscriptions have been 
growing over recent years. Between 2013 and 2018 there 
were 1 billion new mobile subscribers and 67% of the 
world population is now subscribed to mobile services 
(GSMA, 2018c; 2019a). Much of this recent growth 
has been driven by countries in Africa and Asia and 
the Pacific. Access to computers and internet has also 
been increasing in LDCs and developing economies. 
Yet 3.8 billion people still remain offline and are 
disproportionately located in rural and remote areas 
(GSMA, 2018c).
One challenge is that network coverage in rural areas 
remains limited. Despite 4G becoming the most common 
mobile connection globally and 90% of being able to 
access the internet through 3G or higher quality network, 
only around a third of rural populations in LDCs receive 
coverage by 3G networks (GSMA, 2019a). 
Smartphones have become a major way for consumers to 
access internet. Falling handset prices and innovations 
such as pay-as-you-go plans mean that mobile devices 
are increasingly affordable and accessible, including for 
rural communities (Hahn and Kibora, 2008). Among 
the world’s poorest households, 7 out of 10 have a 
mobile phone and more households in LDCs (ITU, 
2018). However, these are not always web-enabled 
smartphones.
Although the growth of smartphone ownership and 
use of mobile broadband has been faster in developing 
countries than developed countries in recent years, there 
are still twice as many mobile-broadband subscriptions 
per 100 inhabitants in developed countries as in 
developing countries (Figure 1). Affordability is the main 
barrier to smartphone ownership in LDCs where a basic 
mobile broadband plan still corresponds to over 60% of 
gross national income per capita on average (ITU, 2017). DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER42.2 Educational attainment, 
digital literacy and 
employment in rural areas
The use of digital technologies requires basic literacy 
and numeracy as well as special technical knowledge 
and skills. People without such competencies can end up 
marginalized in increasingly digitally driven societies. 
2.2.1  CHALLENGES 
In rural areas, a lack of infrastructure and resources often 
limits the quality of education. This leads to less effective 
learning, lower attendance rates and early school leaving. 
Additionally, in many rural areas, youth are often 
required to work which leaves little time for school.
Rates of educational attainment are therefore often 
lower in rural areas than urban areas, especially in 
LDCs (see Figure 2). Despite the fact that 60% of the 
countries for which data are available have eradicated or 
nearly eradicated youth illiteracy, literacy remains low 
in many rural areas of LDCs and particularly among 
women (UNESCO, 2017). A lack of basic literacy and 
numeracy presents a significant barrier to using digital 
technologies.
In addition, ‘digital literacy’ is critical for using digital 
technologies. Unlike in many developed countries, 
where students regularly use advanced technologies and 
digital skills in their education and day-to-day lives, ICT 
knowledge and skills lag behind in LDCs. In many LDCs 
and developing countries, basic computer courses are not 
integrated in primary or secondary education due to a 
lack of interest from governments and the private sector to invest in building new digital skills rather than hiring 
already skilled labour.
A lack of digital tools, such as tablets and laptops, in 
schools is identified by teachers as a major obstacle to 
IT education (European Commission, 2019). There is 
also a lack of relevant skills among teachers. This tends 
to be particularly true in rural areas. For schools in 
urban areas, access to the internet and online learning 
resources is usually commonplace. However, rural and 
remote schools often lack access to internet. This pattern 
is true even in developed countries, but is particularly 
pronounced in developing countries and LDCs.
Over the next 15 years, around 1.6 billion people in 
developing countries and LDCs will reach working 
age. Creating the necessary jobs while sustaining 
existing employment will be a significant challenge, 
especially for the agrifood sector (World Bank, 
2017). Rural unemployment is particularly high 
and disproportionately affects youth and women. 
The agricultural sector remains a major source of 
livelihoods in rural areas. Digitalization of the sector will 
significantly alter the nature of work and the demand for 
labour and skills. Increasingly, digital literacy will be a 
requirement in agrifood jobs and suitable education and 
training will be required. 
2.3 Policies and programmes 
for enabling digital 
agriculture
In many countries, government policies and frameworks 
are one of the driving forces behind digitalization. 
These create an enabling environment for competitive 
digital markets and e-services. There is also a trend 
towards governments themselves deploying e-services 
– ‘e-government’ – especially in health, education, 
environment, and employment.
However, designing and managing a digital government 
program requires a high level of administrative capacity 
and as a result some countries have had limited success 
(Fakhoury, 2018). Developing countries are often the 
ones with the least capacity to manage the process. 
Success also varies by sector and, in many countries, the 
agricultural sector – a major employer in rural areas – 
lags behind.
There is a lack of published research on government 
digitalization policies, but information can be inferred 
from proxies including the extent to which governments 
provide e-services and their policies regarding 
connectivity and data. Figure 1  Subscriber penetration and smartphone

Central African RepublicDIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER62.3.1  CHALLENGES
Compared with just a decade ago, governments have 
made significant progress in expanding ICT access 
and digital networks. Some developed countries are 
reaching near universal access through fixed and mobile 
connections whilst progress is being made in developing 
countries through the expansion of mobile services. 
Many governments have begun using e-services in 
sectors such as health and education (Figure 3). However, 
in LDCs and developing countries, many people cannot 
use e-services because they lack access to ICT due to 
low incomes, limited user capabilities and a lack of 
infrastructure (McKinsey & Co, 2014). As the pace of 
technological innovation intensifies, this is likely to limit 
further development of e-government in these countries.
The type of licensing framework and efficiency of 
spectrum allocation2 that governments use can be 
important in encouraging the private sector to invest 
in mobile networks in remote areas. The experience 
of EU countries suggests that greater liberalization of 
the telecommunications sector supports widespread 
connectivity. Efficient spectrum management can 
also favour mobile network operators through lower 
deployment costs which will bring to end user in terms  
of greater access to ICT services.
Development of government e-services has often been 
particularly slow in the agricultural sector and few 
2 Spectrum allocation refers to the radio frequencies allocated to 
the mobile industry and other sectors for communication over the 
airwaves (GSMA, 2019b)countries provide e-Agriculture services. Those countries 
that do prioritize the use of ICT in agriculture also 
generally have a better business environment and policy 
and regulation framework for agribusiness. It is possible 
this is linked to the use of ICT as it does not seem to 
be related to levels of education, literacy or agricultural 
contribution to GDP in a country.
So far, developed countries are leading on implementing 
national level strategies on digital agriculture. In some 
cases, this is by integrating the agrifood sector as a key 
focus within existing national digital strategies that aim 
to transform wider industry and society. In developing 
countries, most of the e-Agriculture services are 
embedded within e-government or ICT strategies where 
the main objective is to provide basic e-Agriculture 
services such as early alert notifications and general 
information. 
The use of digital technologies will create the need for 
policy and regulation in relation to the data that will be 
generated. A lack of standardization in the format and 
ownership of data could create disparities, particularly 
in a scenario where large international companies are 
pursuing digital agriculture for agribusiness whilst 
smallholders and local agripreneurs are simultaneously 
using technologies to tackle societal challenges in rural 
and farming areas.

Education Health Labour Environment Social protection73 ENABLERS FOR  
DIGITAL AGRICULTURE 
TRANSFORMATION
In addition to basic conditions, there are important 
enablers that facilitate digital agricultural transformation. 
Three key enablers are: the use of internet and mobile 
and social networks among farmers and agricultural 
extension officers, digital skills among the rural 
population and a culture which encourages digital 
agripreneurship and innovation.
With the rise of high speed internet connections and 
web-enabled smartphones, mobile apps, social media, 
VoIP3 and digital engagement platforms have significant 
potential to improve access to information and services 
for those in rural areas. However, many small-scale 
farmers in developing countries remain isolated from 
digital technologies and lack the skills to use them.
Establishing a ‘digital agriculture ecosystem’ requires 
an enabling environment for innovation by farmers and 
agripreneurs. Already, there is increasing funding and 
collaboration on digital agriculture projects and start-
ups are beginning to attract international investors and 
media attention. Youth have a particular role to play in 
this process. They often have the advantage of digital 
literacy and the capacity for innovative solutions. When 
digital topics are integrated in educational programs they 
can also gain an understanding of the uses of digital tools 
and the skills to create them.
3.1 Use of digital technologies 
among rural populations 
and farmers
Literacy and digital skills and the availability of 
technologies all affect the use of digital innovations. 
3  Voice over Internet Platforms or phone services over the internetHowever, the most critical component for unlocking the 
possibilities of digital technologies use is access to the 
internet. 
Although almost half of the world’s population is now 
using the internet, this is disproportionately in developed 
nations. In LDCs, only one out of seven people uses the 
internet (ITU, 2016) and there are apparent disparities 
between rural and urban areas (although the patterns 
vary between countries).
Education and income levels are strong determinants 
of how (and if) people use the internet. Those with 
higher levels of education tend to use more advanced 
services, such as e-commerce and online financial and 
governmental services. Users with lower education 
levels tend to use the internet predominantly for 
communication and entertainment.
In rural areas, where education and literacy rates are 
generally lower, mobile phones tend to be used mainly 
for communication and social media. This presents 
a challenge for the introduction of digital agriculture 
applications which require more advanced digital skills.
Low overall smartphone ownership in rural areas 
combined with the high cost of internet and limited 
network coverage also present challenges to the use of 
mobile agricultural applications and limit the scope to 
use social networks like Facebook to facilitate agricultural 
support and information flows between farmers. Such 
availability of information could support farmers to 
make better farming decisions which could contribute 
to increasing yields, reduced environmental impacts and 
improved livelihoods.
The diversity of available technologies and the lack of 
standardisation and compatibility between them, for DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER8example for the exchange of data, also create a barrier to 
use by farmers. The adaptability of technologies is limited 
and it is often not possible to integrate machinery from 
different brands so farmers must decide which brand to 
invest in. There is a lack of independent advisory services 
to support farmers in making these decisions.
3.2 Digital skills among rural 
populations
Digitalization creates demand for digital skills and for 
people who are competent in using digital devices, 
understanding outputs and developing programmes and 
applications. This requires not only basic literacy and 
numeracy but also data handling and communication 
skills. In populations where such skills are lacking, 
education must improve quickly; ICT is developing at an 
incredibly rapid pace and rates of learning must keep up 
( U N DP, 2015).
Alongside investment in technology, there is therefore 
a growing need for investment in the development of 
multidisciplinary digital skills and knowledge. This 
is true in both developed and developing countries. 
Countries that have ICT education programmes, can 
afford digital tools and have good access to the internet 
will have better digital skills. 
In the agrifood sector, the digital transformation will 
change the structure of the labour market and the 
nature of work. It will redefine the role of farmers and 
agripreneurs and alter the skill set required in the 
agrifood sector. It may also transform how and where 
people work and is likely to affect female and male workers differently due to differences in digital skills and 
technology use. Rural areas in particular lag behind in 
the process of gaining digital skills (Figure 4). There is a 
need to develop a model of digital skills training aimed 
at farmers so they can learn to assess and implement the 
best practices and technologies for their farm business. 
3.3 Digital agripreneurial and 
innovation culture
Digital entrepreneurship involves the transformation of 
existing businesses through novel digital technologies 
and the creation of new innovative enterprises 
characterized by: the use of digital technologies 
to improve business operations, the invention of 
new (digital) business models and engaging with 
customers and stakeholders through new (digital) 
channels (European Commission, 2013). Globally, 
there are an increasing number of initiatives to foster 
digital entrepreneurial activity related to the creation, 
development and scaling-up of ‘digital start-ups’, 
including in the agriculture and food sector. 
Modern day farmers may be particularly suited to 
entrepreneurial activities. These days, farmers often 
design business plans, scout for funding, make use of 
farming enterprise ‘incubators’ and attend scientific 
conferences. Youth farmers in particular are also more 
likely to take risks in their farm management. In Italy, for 
example, over 12 000 agricultural start-ups were created in 
2013 by men and women aged 25 to 30 (Coldiretti, 2018). 
Developed countries are so far the leaders in establishing 
an entrepreneurial culture, but less developed countries

such as Rwanda, Zambia, Turkey and Armenia are also 
rapidly pursuing these opportunities in the digital age. 
3.3.1  CHALLENGES
Entrepreneurship presents a promising option for 
development and business in rural communities. 
With its large farming sector and consumer market, 
Africa is anticipated to be a major testing ground for 
digital solutions by agritech groups (Figure 5). At the 
beginning of 2018, there were 82 agritech start-ups 
operating across Africa with over half launching in the 
previous two years (Disrupt Africa, 2018).
However, despite the rapid growth of digital agricultural 
technologies, most ICT-enabled solutions have yet to be 
demonstrated at scale. Companies – especially SMEs and 
small start-ups – often struggle to move from the stage 
of application development to fully realized businesses. 
One challenge is that there is a lack of guidance for 
entrepreneurs on scaling strategies in under-served 
markets.
To encourage digital agripreneurship, companies need to 
create pools of digitally-skilled employees. This involves 
finding potential employees with relevant skills and 
identifying how they can be attracted and retained, as 
well as recognizing talent that can be nurtured within 
the existing employee base and investing in developing 
digital skills in existing roles.
Education is the most critical factor to accelerating 
innovation and digital transformation. Governments need to adopt a three-pronged approach to stimulating 
research and development (R&D) and innovation 
education: investing in R&D, amplifying indigenous 
R&D and working with a broad coalition of partners to 
redesign education to emphasize e-learning tools, do-it-
yourself hands-on learning, rewards for experimentation, 
critical thinking, and digital and financial literacy and 
software skills.
Youth agripreneurs have a key role to play in the 
digitalization of the agricultural sector. They have unique 
insights from listening to the experiences of their parents 
and grandparents and observing missed opportunities. 
Start-ups from smallholder farming communities often 
draw inspiration from, and are aimed at helping, the 
farming communities where the creators grew up. Youth 
will need sprint programmes and financial support to 
penetrate the agripreneur market. Such programmes 
attract investment and create opportunities for investors 
and start-ups to form collaborations.
The existence of an entrepreneurial culture is often 
not related to the GDP or location of a country. The 
accessibility of e-commerce and digital platforms is 
making it increasingly easy for it to develop anywhere. 
Nevertheless, creating a sustainable digital agripreneurial 
culture is a long-term political and practical process, 
starting with appropriate education in schools. It requires 
an enabling environment which allows risk-taking, 
trust-based relationships between stakeholders, financial 
opportunities, professional services, a sustainable digital 
ecosystem4, the availability of appropriate skills and an 
attitude of sharing or ‘open innovation’.

people and/or things that share standardised digital platformsDIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER10
114 EXAMPLES AND IMPACT 
OF THE USE OF DIGITAL 
TECHNOLOGIES IN 
AGRIFOOD SYSTEMS
Digital transformation has the potential to deliver 
significant economic, social and environmental benefits. 
The following examples demonstrate how digital 
technologies can be applied to improve the efficiency and 
functioning of agrifood systems:
 zThe use of mobile applications providing price 
information to farmers can reduce market distortions 
and help farmers to plan production processes. For 
example, the M-Farm application in Kenya led to 
farmers changing their cropping patterns and some 
reported receiving higher prices at market as a result 
(Baumüller, 2015); zAgricultural robots  (‘agrobots’) are seen as a key 
trend that will deeply influence agriculture in the 
future. Field agrobots are already being deployed 
to help farmers measure, map and optimize water 
and irrigation use. Fleets of small lightweight robots 
are now seen as a replacement for traditional high 
mass tractors, allowing a gradual reduction of 
compaction, re-aeration of the soil and benefits to 
soil function;
EMA-I APP  
ANIMAL HEALTH SYSTEM SUPPORT  
BY FAO
EMA-i is an early warning app developed by FAO 
to facilitate quality and real time livestock disease 
reporting captured by animal health workers in 
the field. EMA-i is integrated in the FAO’s Global 
Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i) 
where data are safely stored and used by countries. 
EMA-i is easily adaptable to countries existing 
livestock disease reporting system. By supporting 
surveillance and real time reporting capacities 
at country level and improving communication 
between stakeholders, EMA-i contributes to 
enhance early warning and response to animal 
disease occurrence with high impact to food 
security and livelihood. EMA-i is currently used 
in six countries in Africa (Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, 
Guinea, Lesotho, Tanzania and Zimbabwe).DINO AGROBOT FOR AGRICULTURE 
AND VITICULTURE
The Naïo Technologies team developed 
agricultural robot to improve working conditions 
and profitability for farmers.
To help farmers tackle the increasing regulations 
on phytosanitary products, the growing concerns 
with pesticides, and the lack of workers in the 
agricultural sector, Dino provides a new and 
effective solution. The Dino weeding robot allows 
vegetable farmers to manage crop weeding with 
a high level of precision, while helping them save 
time all through the season. 
Dino is highly effective to weed vegetables that 
are grown in the field, both in raised vegetable 
beds and in rows, such as lettuce, carrots, onions, 
etc. 
https:/ /www.naio-technologies.com/en/
agricultural-equipment/large-scale-vegetable-
weeding-robot/DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL AREAS:  BRIEFING PAPER12 zTechnologies can also support farmers to anticipate 
and respond to pest attacks, crop failures and climatic 
changes through timely weather-based agro-advisory 
messages;
 zPrecision Agriculture (PA) is an example of an 
application of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 
agriculture. The use of Guidance Systems during 
planting and fertilizer application can lead to cost 
savings in terms of seed, fertilizer and tractor fuel, 
and can reduce working hours in the field. Variable 
Rate Technologies (VRT) and drones (UAV) can also 
reduce water and pesticide use and reduce labour and 
resource costs;
 zThe importance of ERP software in agriculture 
is high, as it has the potential to help streamline 
every process, from procurement to production 
to and distribution. ERP can enable a farm (or 
related business) to respond more organically 
to environmental challenges, adjust systems 
accordingly, and grow into a more cost-efficient 
businesses; zOver the last few years, the growth in Artificial 
Intelligence technology (AI) has strengthened agro-
based businesses to run more efficiently. Companies 
that use AI helps farmers to scan their fields and 
monitor every stage of the production cycle. AI 
technology is transforming the agricultural sector, 
as farmers can depend on the data that satellite 
or UAV record to determine the state of the farm 
rather than walking all the distance. AI can improve 
resource use, support early decision making through 
predictive models and maintain 24/7 monitoring 
systems;
 zTechnologies such as Blockchain have also been 
shown to deliver benefits. For example, Blockchain 
has been successfully used to detect poor quality 
food in food chains allowing early and effective 
responses. It can also provide consumers with 
information on the origin of their food, generating a 
competitive advantage for those who use it.ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING AND JD.
COM LAUNCHES SMART BRAIN FOR 
PIG FARMS
Alibaba’s “ET Agricultural Brain” is an AI 
programme that uses facial, temperature and 
voice recognition to assess each pig’s health. The 
technology can tell whether a sow is pregnant 
by following its sleeping and standing positions 
as well as eating habits, and has been already 
adopted by a number of leading pig farms in 
China. With AI they are able to detect sick hogs 
and minimize accidents, such as protecting 
piglets from accidents through the introduction 
of voice recognition technology. Multiple meters 
are installed to collect data to optimize the 
environment for the herd to grow, as well as 
reducing human errors in the farming process.
Using AI, pig farms will reduce pig farmers’ 
labour costs in the range of 30 percent to 50 
percent, and lower the need for feed, as well as 
shorten hogs’ lifespan by five to eight days by 
optimizing animals’ growth conditions, based 
on the firm’s estimate. China could save CNY50 
billion (US$7 .5 billion) if it applied the system to 
all pig farms nationwide.

spinach and head of lettuce. The giant retailer 
begin requiring lettuce and spinach suppliers 
to contribute to a blockchain database that can 
rapidly pinpoint contamination.
More than 100 farms that supply Walmart with 
leafy green vegetables will be required to input 
detailed information about their food into a 
blockchain database developed by IBM for 
Walmart and several other retailers exploring 
similar moves. 
For Walmart, the initiative fits squarely into 
two key strategies: bolstering its digital savvy 
and emphasizing the quality of its fresh food 
to customers. The blockchain could also save 
Walmart money. When another food-borne illness 
hits — like the E. coli  outbreak affecting romaine 
— the retailer would only have to discard the food 
that was actually at risk.

walmart-blockchain-lettuce.htmlThese technologies often require significant financial 
resources, large farm sizes and close integration with 
other technologies and agrifood chain processes. It is 
therefore a greater challenge for small-scale farmers 
to adopt such technologies, whereas as larger farmers 
and agribusiness companies will be more easily able to 
implement them.145 CONCLUSIONS AND 
FUTURE WORK
The digitalization of agriculture will cause a significant 
shift in farming and food production over the coming 
years. Potential environmental, economic and social 
benefits are significant, but there are also associated 
challenges. Disparities in access to digital technologies 
and services mean there is a risk of a digital divide. 
Smallholder famers and others in rural areas are 
particularly at risk of being left behind, not only in terms 
of e-literacy and access to digital resources but also in 
terms of productivity and aspects of economic and social 
integration. 
Simply introducing technologies is not enough to 
generate results. Social, economic and policy systems 
will need to provide the basic conditions and enablers 
for digital transformation. The “Law of Disruption” 
(Downes, 2009) states that technology changes 
exponentially, but economic and social systems change 
progressively and have trouble keeping up. Work is 
especially needed to ensure the necessary conditions for 
digital transformation are created in rural areas. 
5.1 Challenges to connect 
marginalized and remote 
communities
A well-developed digital infrastructure, especially in 
rural areas, is a precondition for digital agriculture 
and food systems. Although advances in technology 
and regulatory reform have improved access to ICT 
for people around the world, there still exists a digital 
divide. Just as a certain technology (e.g. dial-up Internet) 
becomes available across income levels, a new technology 
(e.g. broadband) appears, leaving users in developing 
countries ‘playing catch up’.
Although mobile-cellar subscriptions in the last five 
years were driven by countries in Africa and Asia and 
the Pacific, many people still do not own or use a mobile 
phone and the distribution of ownership is unequal. 
Access to web-enabled smartphones and fast 3G or 4G 
internet connections remains particularly limited in rural areas. There will need to be work to address this disparity 
and to facilitate smartphone ownership and use in areas 
where it is currently lacking.
Both literacy and education levels also remain particularly 
low for rural populations in developing countries and 
LDCs which presents a barrier to the use of digital 
technologies. Youth unemployment rates are often higher 
than the country average and this is especially the case 
in rural areas. Increasingly, employers want employees 
who are adept at using technology. A lack of e-literacy 
and digital skills in rural areas means these populations 
will fall behind in the modern labour market. There is a 
need for school curricula to incorporate digital subjects, 
for improved knowledge and skills among teachers 
and for increased availability of digital technologies in 
classrooms.
To unlock the full potential of digital agriculture 
transformation, governments need to create an enabling 
regulatory environment. Designing and managing 
digital government programmes requires a high level of 
administrative capacity which is beyond the capabilities 
of some countries, particularly LDCs and developing 
countries. Addressing the digital divide must be made 
a policy priority and governments should make the 
socioeconomic case for digitalization of smallholder 
farming both to the farmers, and to potential private 
sector investors and start-up businesses. There will need 
to be significant capacity building among governments in 
developing countries and LDCs to facilitate this change 
in policy and regulation.
There is increased interest in data-enabled farming 
and related services and many new entrants from the 
technology industry and start-ups. Vast data collection 
will drive the use of machine learning and AI and 
new models will need to be developed to make the 
data useful. So far, the information gathered is often 
insufficient to inform the comprehensive solutions and 
partnerships needed to transform smallholder farming 
into viable, sustainable digital businesses. There also 
need to be decisions about the ownership and use of data; 15CHAPTER 5  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

Social networksPercentage of respondentsmanufacturers collect data from their devices and have 
the opportunity to exploit them, but farmers are often 
reluctant to share their data without receiving something 
in return. 
Strategies for digital agricultural transformation in 
developing countries must combine IT infrastructure 
with social, organisational and policy change.
5.2 Drivers and demands for 
unlocking digital 
agriculture transformation
Access to the internet remains the most critical 
component for unlocking the possibilities of new 
technologies. Across the globe, smartphones dominate in 
terms of time spent online and could be a game changer 
in the agrifood sector in LDCs and developing countries. 
They create opportunities to access information and 
services through mobile applications, online videos and 
social media. Sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
present a cost-effective means of communication 
with, and among, smallholder farmers and other key 
agricultural stakeholders such as extension officers, 
agro-dealers, retailers, agricultural researchers and policy 
makers (Figure 6). 
Falling handset prices, increasing internet coverage 
and the growing youth population create significant 
opportunities for the use of mobile phones in agricultural 
areas. However, internet provision and smartphone 
ownership remain lower in developing countries, and 
particularly in rural areas, and there needs to be more 
research into the use of mobile internet and social media 
in rural communities.Additionally, not all farmers are quick to adopt ICT. Many 
lack the necessary knowledge to request or use services, 
especially as ICT applications in the agrifood sector 
are relatively new and many e-services are still being 
developed. It is critical that technologies are properly 
targeted; if they do not provide the information that 
farmers need, they will not be adopted. 
Digital skills and e-literacy remain a significant 
constraint to the use of new technologies and are 
particularly lacking in rural areas, especially in 
developing countries. The diversity of available digital 
technologies and a lack of standardisation also present 
a barrier to adoption. The choice of which technology 
to use is complex and there is a lack of advisory services 
to support farmers in these decisions. Education and 
supporting services must be improved to support the 
adoption of digital technologies.
Digital technology is already changing the dynamics of 
the agrifood sector but the process has so far not been 
systematic. Realising the full potential of digital farming 
will require collaboration of all players in the agricultural 
value chain. There is a need for a clear overview on the 
part of actors working in agrifood and digital products 
– including private sector, governments and other 
agencies – on how to exploit the opportunities of digital 
agriculture.
Farmers have a key role to play and digital technologies 
provide new opportunities for them to collaborate 
and innovate. There is also a growing group in the 
farming sector who have university degrees and 
specialisations in science and technology subjects. They 
are often skilled in experimentation and innovative 
thinking. Youth in the agrifood sector are also often 
entrepreneurial and willing to take calculated risks to 
pursue new enterprises.

activities such as: business courses in agriculture, ICT 
curricula in education, increased capacity and support 
for innovation hubs and incubators, increased availability 
of venture capital (especially mid-level financing 
needed for scaling) and creation of a more favourable 
business environment. Because the real impact is from 
the businesses they create, and the amount and kind of 
employment that their SMEs or digital farms create.
5.3 Future work
Much work is needed in the area of digitalization in 
agriculture and rural areas. There are some key factors to 
be considered in this work.
Firstly, a significant challenge in understanding digital 
agricultural transformation is a lack of systematic, official 
data on the topic. Much of the data – for example on 
levels of e-literacy – are only available at the country level 
with no distinction for urban and rural areas. Meanwhile, 
data on networks focus only on coverage and do not 
provide information about the quality or affordability 
of services. There is also a lack of information about 
government support and regulatory frameworks for 
digital transformation; so far, this has been interpreted 
via proxies including the availability of government 
e-services and regulations about connectivity and data 
protection.
A second consideration is that there are significant 
disparities in the adoption of digital agriculture 
technologies between developed and developing 
countries and between global companies and those at 
a local, community or family scale. Factors including 
financial resources and education levels influence 
the adoption of modern agricultural technologies. 
Small farmers in rural areas are disproportionately 
disadvantaged as well as facing problems of limited 
access to infrastructure, networks and technology. A final factor to consider is that digital agricultural 
technologies are affected by economies of scale. Adoption 
is easier for users who can implement them at large scale. 
Small-scale farmers face a disadvantage compared to 
large agribusiness actors. This creates disparity between 
large and small-scale farmers, with a corresponding 
inequality between developed and developing countries. 
Transformative digital innovations and technologies are 
often not designed for the scale at which smallholder 
farmers operate.
Some specific priorities for future work are:
 zFacilitating the collection of better data about digital 
technologies and digitalisation at the regional and 
population level, particularly to show differentiated 
information about urban and rural areas;
 zCreation of sustainable business models that provide 
viable digital solutions for  inclusion of small-scale 
farmers in the digital agriculture transformation 
process;
 zCreation of an index to consider the development 
of digital agriculture in the context of cultural, 
educational and institutional dimensions of a given 
country, both in terms of the availability of basic 
conditions and enablers for digitalization and the 
potential economic, social and environmental impacts 
of the process. This could involve further development 
of a Digital Agriculture Readiness Index, expanding 
on previous work by the FAO Regional Office for 
Europe and Central Asia in 2015. Such an index would 
help provide context for the development of future 
digital agriculture strategies for the FAO member 
countries, which starts with sensitizing countries to 
the concept of digital agriculture and the importance 
of digital technologies for the agrifood sector and 
continues with steps towards the digital agriculture 
transformation process.176 REFERENCES

Ownership and Use
of Mobile Devices
Among Adolescents
in Indonesia
Ahmad R. Pratama1,2and
Lori L. Scarlatos2
Abstract
This article offers insights into the ownership and use of mobile devices (smart-
phones and tablets) among Indonesian middle and high school students. The study isbased on primary data collected from a survey of 1,157 students at two middle
schools and two high schools from two different regions in Indonesia. Data analysis
includes multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression models. The find-ings show that both ownership and use of mobile devices varies significantly among
students of different sex, age, location, and most importantly socioeconomic
status. This article also reports the use of mobile apps in three separate categories(i.e., educational apps, social media, and mobile games), showing some differences
in duration and frequency of mobile apps use between different group of students.
These findings can serve as a foundation for further research on how mobiletechnology can be used to improve educational attainment in Indonesia and other
developing countries.

Introduction
As the fourth most populous country in the world, the archipelago nation of
Indonesia is a promising market for mobile technology. By early 2015,
mobile connections in Indonesia already outnumbered the total populationitself (309.2 million vs. 255.5 million) placing Indonesia ahead of many devel-
oped countries regarding the number of mobile connections per capita (Kemp,
2015). This number is predicted to go even higher as the growth rate of mobilesubscriptions in Indonesia is calculated as 9% annually (Kemp, 2017).Indonesian people also use their mobile devices to access the Internet more
than people in most countries: Half of the web trafﬁc in Indonesia comes
from mobile devices, compared with the global average of 33%. At the sametime, Internet penetration increased signiﬁcantly from 15% (Kemp, 2014) to
51% (Kemp, 2017) in Indonesia, placing Indonesia as the country with highest
growth in Internet user by 2017 (Kemp, 2017).
Despite the increasing access to both personal computers and mobile devices
over time, a problem of inequality persists. Also known as digital divide, a term
that was ﬁrst coined in late 20th century, this problem has been well researched(Norris, 2001; Pratama & Al-Shaikh, 2012; Sidorenko & Findlay, 2001).
Some studies conﬁrm the existence of a digital divide between race, age, and
sex (Colley & Comber, 2003; Jackson et al., 2008), while others argue thatincome or socioeconomic status (SES) is the most important factor of a digitaldivide (Calvert, Rideout, Woolard, Barr, & Strouse, 2005; Chinn & Fairlie,
2007). Differences in use patterns seem to be dynamic: In studies where the
gap was narrowed, it nevertheless remained among some groups of people.For example, males were signiﬁcantly more likely to be heavier users of personal
computers until the gap with females narrowed in 1992 (Rocheleau, 1995).
A qualitative study comparing the availability of, access to, and use of com-puters in a group of low and high SES high school in California shows thatstudents in high SES high school have a better overall experience, even when the
student–computer ratios in both schools were similar (Warschauer, Knobel, &
Stone, 2004). A nationwide survey by Pew Research Center in the United Statesshowed the overall Internet adoption rates have leveled off by 2012 comparedwith the previous survey in 2000. However, it is not the same case with the use
rates as those who were already online were doing more than those who just
started (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012).
On many occasions, researchers have tried to investigate the relationship
between mobile devices and education. Some studies suggest the use of mobiledevices can help improve the quality of education, either by supporting academ-
ic growth and empowerment (Mouza & Barrett-Greenly, 2015) or by enhancing
learning attitudes and learning achievements of the students (Hwang, Wu, & Ke,2011; Martin & Ertzberger, 2013). Furthermore, many mobile learning activitieshave been scientiﬁcally proven to have a positive relationship with education2 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)attainment. For example, the use of e-books to replace traditional printed text-
books is associated with higher perceived affective and psychomotor learning
(Rockinson-Szapkiw, Courduff, Carter, & Bennett, 2013). Mobile devices canalso allow students to do some out-of-class learning activities as opposed to
learning in front of computer within a lab, hence increasing students’ willingness
to continue to engage in learning (Sung & Mayer, 2013). Furthermore, mobiledevices can be used to track and monitor the time devoted to self-regulated
learning that improves students’ time management skills (Tabuenca, Kalz,
Drachsler, & Specht, 2015).
On the other hand, some studies suggest that mobile devices can sometimes
hinder educational attainment. Studies highlighting the problematic use of
mobile devices tend to focus primarily on addiction (Kamibeppu & Sugiura,2005; Ozkan & Solmaz, 2015; Walsh, White, & Young, 2008). Excessive use of
mobile devices is associated with psychological distress (Beranuy, Oberst,
Carbonell, & Chamarro, 2009) or may even lead to the occurrence of cognitivefailures such as lower working memory capacity and poorer attentional control
in daily life (Hadlington, 2015).
Therefore, the relationship between mobile technology and education
appears to be like a double-edged sword: It can have both favorable and unfa-
vorable consequences. However, looking more closely at the previous studies,
the problematic use of mobile devices tends to be the result of obsessive overuse.One may argue that too much of anything, no matter how good it is, is usually
bad. Furthermore, looking at the cases where mobile devices have a supportive
relationship toward education, all the activities with mobile devices are basicallydone by design. Mobile devices by themselves do not help with educational
attainment; yet using mobile devices in some designated scenario, whether
formal or informal, can. Therefore, to get the most beneﬁt of integratingmobile devices into the educational environment, educators must ﬁrst determine
the activities and conditions for their use.
While results from other studies done in different parts of the world can
provide a good insight of what the state of the art is in this ﬁeld, most of
them are focused on developed countries and nothing much has been learned
in the case of Indonesia. Considering all the cultural and demographicdifferences in Indonesia, along with its huge population and vastly growing
information and communication technology (ICT) use and mobile penetration,
it is a good idea to explore what the case is directly in this country. This kind ofexploratory study is necessary before one can go further with some sort of
proposed method in optimizing the use of mobile devices for educational pur-
poses. This article presents ﬁndings from a larger PhD study (Pratama, 2019).Its primary contribution is to identify patterns, conﬁrm important factors, and
point out signiﬁcant differences in ownership and use of mobile devices
among Indonesian adolescents. These ﬁndings also have implications forother developing nations that are also trying to enhance their educationalPratama and Scarlatos 3attainment through ICT utilization. As a previous study at a cross-country level
suggests, the higher participation rate in educational system of a country, par-ticularly in secondary and tertiary level, the higher its ICT utilization rate is.
This, in turn, is also associated with better education outcomes of the said
country (Pratama, 2017). A better understanding of ownership and use ofmobile devices, which is a major part of ICT utilization nowadays, from a
country that shares some cultural similarities or the same infrastructure prob-
lems and challenges would be of assistance for such a quest.
Research Design, Methodology, and Samples
This study employs a multiple-case design, involving students from severaldifferent schools selected to account for differences in location and education
level. As is true in many other countries, there is a problem with regional
inequality in Indonesia. Studies have conﬁrmed the existence of inequalitybetween urban and rural areas as well as between those who live in Java
(the most populous island, home to about 46% of Indonesians) and those
who live in other islands. People living in urban areas generally enjoy abetter life than those who live in rural areas; so do people who live in Javaisland compared with those who live in other islands (Akita, Lukman, &
Yamada, 1999; Suryadarma, Widyanti, Suryahadi, & Sumarto, 2006).
Because signiﬁcantly more people in Java live in urban areas (StatisticsIndonesia, 2014), the location factors were combined by selecting a school
located in urban Java to be compared with another school in rural non-
Java, thus reducing t he number of schools required for the study. In terms
of education level, the Indonesian education system embraces 6 years of sec-
ondary education that are split equally between middle school and high school,
with 3 years in each. By the end of the third year in each level, there is aNational Exam used to determine whether students can graduate from their
current education level and if they are eligible to continue to the next educa-
tion level.
An anonymous paper-based survey was conducted in two middle schools
and two high schools in Indonesia, one for each urban Java and rural non-Java area, within the ﬁrst quarter of 2016. The survey was ﬁlled out by the
students in class settings during school hours. As English is not the native
language of Indonesian people, the questionnaire was delivered in BahasaIndonesia instead. Students were selected by using stratiﬁed random sam-
pling at class level based on school, grade, sex, and major for the 11th and
12th graders only. The comparison between collected samples and the actualpopulation is shown in Figure 1. After dealing with missing values, a total of
1,157 students participated in the study, equal to 97.15% response rate.
They ranged from 13 to 19 years of age ( M¼15.80, SD¼1.71).
Participants were then categorized based on self-perceived ICT adoption4 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)level representing their attitude toward ICT (124 early adopters, 10.71%; 760
majorities, 65.63%; and 274 laggards, 23.66%) and SES measured by the
purchase price of their devices (124 high SES, 10.71% and 1,034 middle-to-
low SES, 89.29%).
Results and Discussion
Device Ownership
Students participating in this study were asked if they own each of the following
digital devices: (a) desktop, (b) laptop, (c) smartphone, and (d) tablet. Table 1
shows the descriptive statistics of this device ownership information, categorized
by each of the independent variables (i.e., sex, age, school, education level,
location, SES, attitude toward ICT, and year in school). Meanwhile, Figure 2
shows the comparison of device ownership rate with similar statistics from the
United States. As the data indicate, smartphone and laptop are the most pop-
ular devices among Indonesian students, and the ownership rate for these two
devices is signiﬁcantly higher than those of American people.
The logistic regression estimates for each device ownership in Table 2 show
that the model is statistically signiﬁcant for all four devices. From these results,
male students are more likely to own desktop than female students, while the
opposite is true for tablet, which is more favorable toward female students.
Meanwhile, laptop and smartphone tend to be sex agnostic. Student’s attitudes
toward ICT adoption are positively correlated with device ownership in three
models; those who consider themselves as early adopters in ICT are more likely

those who consider themselves as laggard are the ones who are less likely to ownany digital devices. This variable is not signiﬁcant only in laptop ownershipmodel while being the only signiﬁcant predictor in smartphone ownershipmodel. The former might have something to do with the fact that manyschools in Indonesia do not have good computer lab infrastructure and askTable 1. Descriptive Statistics of Device Ownership.

that students who do not own a smartphone probably do not because of their
personal preference (i.e., less favorable attitudes toward ICT) rather than any
other reasons.
Regarding SES, students with high SES are more likely to own desktop,
laptop, or tablet than students with lower SES. This does not apply to smart-phone ownership, and this further conﬁrms the status of smartphone as the most
favorable computing device for Indonesian students regardless of their SES. In
terms of location, students in urban Java are more likely to own a personalcomputer, whether it is a desktop or laptop, than students in rural non-Java. As
for education level, high school students are more likely to own a personal
computer, whether it is a desktop or a laptop, than middle school students.
Likewise, students in a higher grade are more likely to own the same devices
than students in a lower grade.
On the other hand, younger students, holding all other variables including
education level and grade constant, are more likely to own some devices, par-
ticularly desktop and tablet, than older students. This ﬁnding is particularlyinteresting because age is highly correlated to both grade and education level
(i.e., students in a higher grade are likely older than students in a lower grade).
However, it is important to note that there can be age differences betweenstudents in the same grade and education level in Indonesia’s schools;
Figure 2. Comparison of ownership rate between Indonesian students in this study and
American students and adults in 2015–2016.
Source . *Pearson Student Mobile Device Survey, 2015; **Pew Research Center, April 2016.Pratama and Scarlatos 7apparently, older students are less likely to own devices than younger students in
the same grade. While the data are not enough to explain why this is, there couldbe some other factors at play, such as parents’ age and what the student’s birthorder is in the family. It is possible that older students in the same grade are theyoungest child of much older parents (and therefore started school later), where-
as their younger classmates are the oldest child of younger parents. Having
parents from a younger generation who are more technologically literatecould be the important factor driving for a more favorable condition ofdevice ownership for these students.
The model for smartphone ownership has only one signiﬁcant predictor,
while there are at least four signiﬁcant predictors in the model of the other
three devices. In the desktop ownership model, all six predictors are signiﬁcant.This result indicates that smartphone is indeed the universal device to have forthese students regardless of their demographic characteristics. The only thingthat matters is their attitudes toward ICT.Table 2. Logistic Regression Estimates of Device Ownership.

devices suggests the need for similar analysis of device bundle ownership. Out of16 possible device bundles that can be from out of four devices to own, fourmajor types of bundles were identiﬁed, as shown in Figure 3. These four majorbundles (i.e., all four devices, desktop–laptop–smartphone, tablet–laptop–smartphone, and laptop–smartphone) account for 87.55% of total students,leaving only 6.22% who own no more than one device, 5.96% who own anyother bundles, and 0.26% who own none of these four devices at all.
Meanwhile, Table 3 shows the logistic regression estimates for device bundle
ownership. The bundle ownership model is statistically signiﬁcant for the all-four-device bundle as well as the no bundle. From these results, male studentsare more likely to own the three-device bundle without tablet than female stu-dents, while the opposite is true for the three-device bundle with a tablet, whichis more favorable toward female students. Meanwhile, just like in the deviceownership analysis for each one of them, the laptop and smartphone bundletends to be sex agnostic. Student’s attitudes toward ICT adoption variable are astrong predictor only in the all-four-device bundle and the nonbundle owner-ship. Those who consider themselves as early adopters are more likely to be theowner of all-four-device bundle, while those who consider themselves as
Figure 3. Groups of students based on device bundle ownership.Pratama and Scarlatos 9laggards are more likely to own one device only, which, combined with the
previous ﬁndings, is most likely to be a smartphone. In terms of SES, students
with high SES are more likely to own any bundle with a tablet in it than anyother bundle without a tablet, which is more favorable by students with middle-to-low SES. Again, combined with the previous ﬁndings, it is most likely due tothe strong correlation between tablet and high SES, to begin with.
Regarding the location, students in urban Java are more likely to own bun-
dles with a desktop than students in rural non-Java. One of the most plausiblereasons is that it is easier and cheaper for those living in urban Java to buydesktop computers than those living in rural non-Java. It could also be becausethe supporting infrastructures, such as ﬁxed broadband (e.g., asymmetric digitalsubscriber line, Fiber) and wireless (Wi-Fi) Internet connection in Java are much
better than in non-Java. This ﬁnding is also supported by another section in theTable 3. Logistic Regression Estimates of Device Bundle Ownership.

Based on all these ﬁndings, Figure 4 shows the most plausible ﬂow of device
ownership and bundle patterns among these students. It is all started with a
smartphone, which is the universal device and the one owned by the majority of
the nonbundle owner. Laptop is the second device to add with a clear majorityof these students own these two devices already. For the third device to add tothe bundle, there are two distinct options. Male students, students with middle
and low SES, and students from urban Java are more likely to add desktop as
the third device, while female students, students with high SES, and studentsfrom the rural non-Java area are more likely to add tablet as the third device in
the bundle. Finally, those who consider themselves as early adopters, younger

Students who own mobile devices (i.e., smartphone or tablet) were asked the
following: (a) How many hours a day they spend on their mobile device, and (b)how often they use apps in three separate categories: social media, educational,
and mobile gaming? The survey listed 15 to 25 of the most frequently down-
loaded apps in Indonesia, in both iOS and Android platforms for each category.Subjects were asked to indicate whether they have installed the apps on their
mobile device, and how often they use each of those apps (monthly, weekly,
daily) if installed. Table 4 shows how the use of apps was originally measured inthe survey, and how it was coded differently for further analysis in this chapter.

Students who use at least one app in the category at least once a week areconsidered regular users of that category. Those who use at least one app inthe category on a daily basis are considered heavy users. All heavy users areregular users, but not all regular users are heavy users. Table 8 shows the sum-mary of regular and heavy users as well as the ratio between them for eachcategory. It is quite clear that these students use signiﬁcantly more social mediathan any other apps categories on their mobile device. It is also found that theyplay games signiﬁcantly less than they use educational apps. A series of two-sample tests of proportion between each pair of apps categories (i.e., educationvs. games, education vs. social, and games vs. social) are used to conﬁrm thesigniﬁcant difference in use between these three categories and the results showconsistency for both regular and heavy users.Table 8. Regular and Heavy Users in Three Separate Mobile Apps Category.

Figure 5. Regular users of social media, games, and educational apps with the intersection of
each category.Pratama and Scarlatos 15Social media apps have the highest ratio of regular to heavy users, indicating
a very strong level of engagement in that 98% of the regular users are also heavy
users. On the other hand, while the ratio for educational apps and games are notas high as social media apps, they both still indicate a strong level of engagement
at 73% and 63%, respectively. In other words, most regular users for any cat-
egories use the apps on a daily basis instead of weekly basis.
Being a regular or heavy user in one category does not necessarily mean the
same thing for another category. To get a better look at this overlapping use of
apps in three different categories, the next step is to look at the intersections ofeach category. Two customized bar charts were generated in R with the help
of the UpSetR library (Gehlenborg, 2017) as shown in Figures 5 and 6 for
regular users and heavy users, respectively. As indicated by these diagrams,the use in three apps categories overlaps a lot, especially for regular use. As
for heavy use, a signiﬁcant number of users are identiﬁed as exclusively heavy
users for only social media apps, almost 3 times as much as it is in regular users.
These diagrams help uncover some valuable information. First, almost half
of the students use only social media and educational apps together, either on a
daily basis or weekly basis. Second, more than a third of these students use appsin all three categories regularly, but most of them only do it on a weekly basis,
and only less than a half do it on a daily basis. Third, students who use exclu-
sively social media apps on their mobile device are more likely to do it on a dailybasis than on a weekly basis; there are 3 times as many students doing the
Figure 6. Heavy users of social media, games, and educational apps with the intersection of
each category.16 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)former than those who do the latter. And fourth, apart from those who use apps
in all three categories regularly, students who play games on their mobile devices
are more likely to do it on a daily basis than on a weekly basis. This rate ofheavy use increases for students who play games but do not use educational
apps on their mobile device, especially for those who use their mobile device
exclusively for gaming (albeit only two and seven students were categorized asexclusively regular and heavy mobile gamers, respectively). This indicates that
games, just like social media apps, are more addictive than educational apps.
The difference is that games have a much smaller niche than social media apps,which are much more popular among common users.Table 9. Logistic Regression Estimates of Apps Use.

*p/C20.05. ** p/C20.01. *** p/C20.001.Pratama and Scarlatos 17The next analysis estimates the frequency of app use to identify any signiﬁ-
cant predictors of regular and heavy use in each category. Two new dummy
variables were constructed from the previous apps use variable to representthese two types of users for each apps category. The same independent variables
used in the previous logistic regression analysis are used in the models, in addi-
tion to two device bundles, each representing one end of the spectrum: thosewho own all four devices and those who have a smartphone as their only per-
sonal computing device. Table 9 shows the results of logistic regression models.
The age variable is omitted in the model due to multicollinearity with grade andeducation level.
The ﬁndings show that regular and heavy users of educational apps are more
likely to be older students (high school vs. middle school and higher grade vs.lower grade), students in urban Java, those with more positive attitudes toward
ICT, and those who own all-four-device bundle. On the contrary, students who
only own a smartphone are less likely to use educational apps regularly. Formobile games, male students are much more likely to play regularly than female
students, even more so when it comes to playing these games on a daily basis.
Students in the rural non-Java area, the owners of the all-four-device bundle,and younger students (middle school vs. high school and lower grade vs. higher
grade) are also more likely to play games on their mobile device regularly.
In terms of social media apps use, things are a little bit different than the
other two categories due to the fact the more than 96% of them are regular users
of social media already. As it turns out, only one predictor is signiﬁcant in the
model for regular use of social media apps. Those who own a smartphone astheir only mobile are the only group who are less likely to access social media on
their mobile device. For heavy use, however, more predictors turn out to be
signiﬁcant. Those with more positive attitudes toward ICT, high school stu-dents, and students in urban Java are more likely to access their social media
on a daily basis rather than on a weekly basis. The difference between signiﬁcant
predictors for the regular and the heavy use of social media is not that surprisingconsidering the distribution of the students who use social media on their mobile
device. It indicates that the difference between regular and heavy users of social
media is as signiﬁcant as the difference between nonregular and regular users,unlike in games and educational apps where the difference between regular
and heavy users is not as signiﬁcant as the difference between nonregular and
regular users.
Furthermore, purchasing price of mobile devices turns out not to be a sig-
niﬁcant predictor in any model, contrary to the education level and location that
are signiﬁcant predictors for all three apps categories. This ﬁnding suggeststhat geographical proximity is an inﬂuential factor to the network effect of
apps use, especially for educational apps and games. A more detailed look at
the data shows that the most played game among these students is Clash ofClans, a massive multiplayer online real-time strategy game. This type of game18 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)requires players to team up with other players to form a clan if they want to
increase the chance of winning the game. Also, unlike some other console-like
games that are usually graphically and computationally demanding, this gamecan run well on pretty much any mobile devices regardless of its price so long as
it has an acceptable Internet connection.
Time spent on mobile device. The next step is to investigate the relationship
between app use in all three categories with the total time spent on mobile
devices daily. The data for total time spent on mobile devices are self-reported as six-level categorical variable as shown in Table 4. Multiple corre-
spondence analysis (MCA) is used to analyze the multivariate relationship
between app use and time spent on mobile devices because of the followingreasons. First, MCA is speciﬁcally designed for analyzing nominal and categor-
ical data, as opposed to principal component analysis that is used for analyzing
continuous data. Second, it can be used to detect the underlying structures in thedataset without having to satisfy a certain assumption, unlike regression anal-
yses. And third, it will be more helpful to have a good visualization of the data
with point clouds representing individuals in a two-dimensional Euclidean spaceproduced by MCA. The MCA is done with R 3.4.3 in RStudio with the help of
FactoMineR (Leˆet al., 2008), factoextra (Kassambara & Mundt, 2017), ggplot2
(Wickham, 2016), and ggrepel (Slowikowski, 2017) libraries. All four variables
of interest are set as active categories, while the other relevant variables from the
survey such as demographic data are used as supplementary variables. Given
the characteristics of the data, several iterations of MCA are done with somechanges in the model, speciﬁcally in the categorization or data coding of all four
active categories. In terms of the observations included in the visualization, the
initial run has all students who own mobile devices included, but the resultingvisualization is not that helpful because of the outliers, identiﬁed as the nonuser
and ex-user of social media apps. There are two possible approaches to deal with
this matter. The ﬁrst is by removing the outliers, and the other approach is bycombining all the nonuser, ex-user, and sometimes also light user of social media
as one group instead of treating them as separate categories.
After 45 iterations of MCA, each with different model speciﬁcations, two
ﬁnal models were selected. The main difference between the two models is that
the ﬁrst model (A) uses Type 2A coding (i.e., light vs. regular users), while the
second model (B) uses Type 2B coding (i.e., casual vs. heavy users) for all threeapps categories as speciﬁed in Table 4. Regarding the daily time spent on mobile
devices, a simpler three-level category is used in both models. It is done by
combining all the intermediary groups (i.e., 1–2 hours, 2–3 hours, 3–4 hours,and 4–5 hours per day) into one (i.e., 1–5 hours) as they often overlap with
each other in the visualization of other models. Finally, in dealing with the
outliers, the second approach is used as it can explain slightly more variancesthan the ﬁrst approach while having no signiﬁcant difference in the resultsPratama and Scarlatos 19between the two of them. This approach also means the same number of obser-
vations is used in all analyses throughout this chapter.
The ﬁrst MCA visualization approach used is the biplot of active categories
for each model. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the ﬁrst two principal dimensions

MCA¼multiple correspondence analysis.

Figure 9. MCA factor map of individuals with confidence ellipses around active categories
for Model A.MCA¼multiple correspondence analysis.Pratama and Scarlatos 21can explain 29.66% of the total variances for Model A and 28.39% of the total
variances for Model B, respectively. In both models, the ﬁrst principal dimen-
sion separates the nonuser from any types of users in all three categories, whilethe second principal dimension is highly correlated with the daily time spent on
mobile devices. Interestingly, from both biplots, it looks like those who spent
5 hours or more per day on their mobile device are most likely to be regulargamers and heavy users of educational apps. The biplots also suggest that the
ex-gamers are more likely to be former light gamers than former regular gamers.
This ﬁnding is supported by the next visualization of MCA factor map ofindividuals with conﬁdence ellipse around each category as shown in Figure 9
for Model A and Figure 10 for Model B, respectively. While the factor map
shows no overlap in the conﬁdence ellipses in any category, the distance betweenlight gamers and ex-gamers in Model A is minimal. These ﬁgures also show two
distinct populations between gamers, including those who no longer play games
presumably temporarily and nongamers.
While the ﬁrst two dimensions can only explain less than 30% of the varian-
ces, adding the next three principal dimensions can help explain up to 63.5%
of the total variances in Model A and up to 59.4% of the total variances inModel B. As shown in the chart, heavy users of educational apps are closely
related to those who spent 5 hours or more per day only in the biplots form the
ﬁrst two principal dimensions and not from the others. The opposite is true forregular and heavy gamers who are closely related to those who spent 5 hours or
more per day in all but one biplot from the ﬁrst ﬁve principal dimensions.
It further indicates that heavy users of educational apps are the ones whospent 5 hours per day on their mobile device only for around 30% of these
students but not for the other 70%. Overall, games and social media apps have a
stronger and more consistent inﬂuence in making these students spend moretime on their mobile device.
The last analysis in this article is to estimate the time spent on mobile devices
to see if there are any signiﬁcant predictors of spending more hours on mobiledevices. Because it is less reliable to treat the self-reported data of daily time
spent on mobile devices as a continuous variable and because almost half of the
students spent 5 hours or more per day, logistic regression method is once againused to analyze the data. One new dummy variable is constructed to differen-
tiate between those who spent 5 hours or more on mobile devices and those who
spent less than 5 hours per day. The same independent variables used in theprevious logistic regression analysis to estimate the frequency of apps use are
also used in the logistic regression model. Table 10 shows the results of the
logistic regression model. Just like in the previous logistic regression models,age variable is, once again, omitted in this model due to multicollinearity with
grade and education level.
The ﬁndings show that the owner of the all-four-device bundle is the stron-
gest predictor of spending 5 hours or more per day on mobile devices, followed22 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)by location, owner of the smartphone-only bundle, the price of the mobile
device, education level, sex, and attitudes toward ICT. The grade is the only
predictor that turned out to be not signiﬁcant. Students who own all-four-devicebundle are more than 4 times more likely to spend 5 hours per day on mobile
devices, while students in the rural non-Java area are more than twice more
likely to do likewise, contrary to the smartphone-only owners who are morethan twice less likely to do so. Students who own the most expensive mobile
devices are almost twice more likely to spend 5 hours or more on their mobile
device, while female students and high school students are about half as likely.Finally, each level increase in students’ attitudes toward ICT increases the like-
lihood of spending 5 hours per day on mobile devices by approximately a third.
This result is quite consistent with the ﬁnding from separate research with col-lege students instead of secondary school students in Indonesia where femaleTable 10. Logistic Regression Estimates of Daily Time Spent on Mobile Devices.

with more positive attitudes toward ICT adoption are more likely to spend moretimes on their mobile devices (Pratama, 2018).
This result is interesting because some predictors such as bundle ownership
and attitudes toward ICT have the same positive effect in daily time spent on
mobile devices as they do in apps use in any categories. For other predictors that
have an alternating effect on apps use in different categories, such as locationand education level, the effect on daily time spent on mobile devices is a com-
bination between the two. The effect of the location variable is like its effect on
games use, while education level variable shares a similar effect on daily time
spent and on educational apps use. The sex variable has the opposite effect
between apps use and daily time spent, while two other variables (i.e., priceand grade) are signiﬁcant predictors for one dependent variable but not for
the other.
From all these ﬁndings, it appears that regular use of apps does not neces-
sarily translate to more time spent on mobile devices for each of the different
groups of users. For example, male students are almost 3 times more likely to beregular gamers and almost 5 times more likely to be heavy gamers than female
students, but the odds of them spending 5 hours or more per day on mobile
devices is almost twice less likely than those of female students. The data also
indicate that a combination of regular use in certain apps category and certain
predictors has a positive effect on daily time spent on mobile devices. This is truefor regular gamers in rural area and high school students who use educational
apps regularly.
Conclusion
This study yielded several signiﬁcant ﬁndings regarding current ownership and
use of mobile devices in secondary schools. While this study focuses onIndonesia, it also has implications for education in other countries. This is
especially true in the Southeast Asia region, in which Indonesia is the largest
and the most populous country and where most other countries in this regionare also developing countries that share some cultural similarities with
Indonesia. It is also true for other developing nations where the ICT infrastruc-
ture, especially for their wired broadband Internet connection, is still limited so
that their people must rely more on wireless networks.
Of four personal computing devices in this study, smartphones and laptops
are the most popular ones with more than 90% of the students already own
either one, far ahead of desktop and tablet that are owned by less than 50%each. While there is no signiﬁcant difference between males and females in terms
of laptop and smartphone ownership, desktops are strongly associated with
males, whereas tablets are strongly associated with females. This is also truefor device bundle ownership. While more than 80% already own both a laptop24 Journal of Educational Technology Systems 0(0)and a smartphone altogether, males are more likely to add a desktop to their
bundle, whereas females are more likely to add a tablet instead. This ﬁnding,
which is consistent with the ﬁnding from separate research with college studentsinstead of secondary school students in Indonesia (Pratama, 2018), might indi-
cate different use cases leading to a strong preference on desktop over tablet for
males and vice versa. For example, desktop gives a better gaming experience,and most gamers are males.
These ﬁndings also conﬁrm the status of smartphone as the most universal
device to own. Students who own no smartphone are most likely due to their lessfavorable attitudes toward ICT instead of any other reasons such as ﬁnancial,
sex, or age. On the other hand, tablet ownership is strongly associated with high
SES. Smartphones are usually the ﬁrst device owned, followed by a laptop.More than 80% of the students already own these two devices in their
bundle. For students who have a third device, desktops are preferred by
males, students with middle-to-low SES, and students from urban Java; tabletsare preferred by females, students with high SES, and students in rural non-Java
instead. More than 20% of the students own all four devices. They tend to be
early adopters, younger students, students in a higher grade, students with highSES, or students in urban Java.
The effect of the digital divide between different geographical regions is clear-
ly shown in the ownership of personal computers. Students in urban Java aremuch more likely to own a desktop, a laptop, or any bundle with both desktop
and laptop than students in rural non-Java. Differences in price and supporting
infrastructure, where students in urban Java have an edge on them over studentsin rural non-Java, might be the main reasons behind it.
Personal computers are also more favorable toward older students than they
are toward younger students. High school students and students in a highergrade are more likely to own either a desktop or a laptop than middle school
students and students in a lower grade, respectively. As students go further in
their education, they tend to have more to do and need more help from theirdevices. This ﬁnding might be an indication that these students still deem per-
sonal computers as more serious devices to do their productivity activities from
than mobile devices. However, age does not necessarily go hand in hand withgrade and education level when it comes to its effect on device ownership.
Although older students in general are more likely to own some devices or
device bundles, younger students in the same grade and education level aremore likely to own the same device than their older classmates. It might be
an indication that some external factors such as parents’ age, parents’ education,
or student’s birth order are at play. Unfortunately, the data collected in thisstudy are not enough to give a better explanation about this ﬁnding.
Regarding mobile app use, 98% are regular users, and most use it on a daily
basis. Educational apps are regularly used by around 85% of the students with73% of them use these apps on a daily basis. Games are used regularly by merelyPratama and Scarlatos 2542% of the students, and only 63% of them play the games on a daily basis.
Of these three apps categories, games have the highest number of ex-users of all
at around 30%, and these ex-users are most likely to be the former light gamers
who play on a monthly basis at most. The data also show that more than 40%
of the students spend 5 hours or more per day on their mobile device. While
almost all of these students are regular or even heavy users of social media, theMCA biplots show that they are also strongly associated with regular and heavy
use of games and educational apps. A stronger and more consistent effect is
found in the regular use of games and social media.
Some limitations in this article could be addressed in the future work by
expanding the sample to include students from different countries and regions
so that the results can be more generalizable to a broader scope. Also, using the
actual income of the student’s family, while might not always be available like it
was in this study, would make for a better measurement for SES than
self-reported purchase price of mobile device used in this article. Finally,
some interesting ﬁndings in this study could be explained better with the inclu-
sion of some other variables about family background such as parental educa-
tion, parents’ age, or student’s birth order.

Abstract: Digital literacy constitutes the basis for citizenship in order to be effective and efficient in
the 21st Century in professional and personal lives. The set of skills and competences integrating
digital literacy are expected to be guaranteed in higher education. During the lockdown globally
imposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, educational systems worldwide had to face many disruptive
changes. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three countries’ higher education
institutions (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador), analyzing how they have faced the global lockdown situation,
focusing on the development of digital literacy. The methodological approach followed in this study
was quantitative with an exploratory-correlational scope using a questionnaire designed ad hoc and
applied in a sample of 376 students. Results point the necessity of enhancing the main aspects such
as the teacher’s digital skills, sources for learning that may be adapted, communication between
universities and students, and teaching methodologies that should be appropriate to the current context.
Conclusions may suggest rethinking higher education learning and reinforcing main issues for this
transformation, mainly: communication, teaching, and digital competences. Otherwise, digital literacy
is not being guaranteed, which means higher education is not accomplishing one of its main objectives.
Keywords: digital literacy; COVID-19; generation Z; students; lockdown; higher education; communication
1. Introduction
The development of the “knowledge society” implies social transformation in which citizens need
new skills and competencies. On the one hand, technological availability has motivated world-class
universities to develop innovative programs and new ideas to accelerate and improve both teaching and
learning [ 1]. On the other, as Jonas-Dwyer and Pospisil [ 2] (p. 195) observe, even if “the technological
revolution has been a catalyst for change in universities”, “research has shown that introducing
new educational technologies alone does not improve teaching and learning outcomes” if they are
not accompanied by specific training. Therefore, in a context of development and expansion of an
increasingly digital society, training in competencies within the scope of digital literacy of higher
education students should be essential, nonetheless, it is often viewed as something that “is often taken
for granted” [ 3] (p. 95). In Poore’s words, today, more than ever, we have the opportunity and the
technologies to assist us in the human project of shaping, creating, authoring, and developing ourselves,
however “we will not be able to achieve a liberating, collective intelligence until we can achieve a
collective digital literacy” [4] (p. 34).
Publications 2020 ,8, 48; doi:10.3390 /publications8040048 www.mdpi.com /journal /publicationsPublications 2020 ,8, 48 2 of 17
Aligning with P érez-Tornero’s holistic approach, understanding media literacy as a concept
embracing all the ﬁelds and all the competences related to media, digital literacy is understood as
the “acquisition of the technical competence for using information and communication technologies,
understood in a broad sense, in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual
capacities for individuals to completely develop themselves in the Information Society” [ 5] (p. 29).
Digital literacy may be understood as an inter-related set of skills or competencies necessary for success
in the digital age [ 6], developed and evolved in di erent dimensions address in models acknowledge
by countries and governments [7].
Within the context of the COVID-19 crisis, this has become even more evident [ 8]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global public health emergency of international concern
on 30th January 2020 as well as a pandemic on 11th March 2020 [ 9]. As of 6th April 2020, UNESCO
reported that there have been 1,576,021,818 affected learners out of 91.3% total enrolled learners in 188
countries in all levels of learning. Exactly as in many other aspects of everyday life, COVID-19 had
a serious impact on students, instructors, and educational organizations around the globe [ 10]: the
pandemic caused schools, colleges, and universities across the globe to shut down their campuses [ 11]
and quickly move conventional education to distance and virtual learning [ 12]. Current educational
circumstances are so unique that some authors accurately propose to define this new situation “crisis
learning”. Due to this uniqueness and exceptionality of past and current circumstances, many studies
are emerging on the impact of COVID-19 restriction measures in different educational levels [ 10,13] and
different contexts [ 11,14,15]. Most of these studies focus either on specific countries [ 13] or on specific
aspects, such as technical aspects of e-learning [ 10] or psychological impact [ 14] or communicative
perspectives [16].
The only—by the time—global study, developed by Crawford and colleagues [ 12], analyzing
twenty countries educational responses, concludes that the educational sector needs to unite to
postulate a future where students can be supported digitally, without compromising academic quality
and standards of the curriculum. The aim of this research is to present a comparative study of three
countries’ higher education institutions (Autonomous University of Barcelona in Spain; University of
Torino in Italy; and Technical University of Machala in Ecuador) analyzing how they have faced the
global lockdown situation, focusing on the development of digital literacy.
2. Generation Z and the “Digital Native” Debate
Although there is no absolute consensus about the precise boundaries of Generation Z, most
literature [ 17–19] considers that it is composed of individuals born between the years 1996 and 2010.
Their most important characteristic is that they are the ﬁrst generation that has never known a world
without the Internet. Their lives are molded by the Internet, which has been converted in a natural part
of their lives. Prensky [ 20] deﬁnes this cohort as “digital natives”, implying that having been exposed
to these digital technologies has endowed this generation with speciﬁc and even unique characteristics
that make its members completely di erent from those growing up in previous generations.
Teräs, Myllyla, and Teräs [ 21] consider that, having grown up with highly sophisticated media,
they are “naturally” more Internet savvy than their forbearers, displaying “natural skills of digital native
learners” (p. 1). Veen and Vrakking [ 22], in the same line, propose to call this generation homo zappiens ,
considering that this cohort have developed all the metacognitive skills necessary for enquiry-based
learning, discovery-based learning, networked learning, experiential learning, collaborative learning,
active learning, self-organization and self-regulation, problem solving, by themselves. According to
this vision, Generation Z students currently attending school or university are, therefore, considered
experts in understanding technology, socially open through the use of technology, fast and impatient,
and interactive and resilient multi-taskers [ 23]. Some research suggests that Generation Zers’ brains are
structurally di erent to those of previous generations [ 18,24]: surrounded by complex visual imagery,
the part of their brain responsible for visual ability is more developed, making them more reactive to
“visual learning”, but with a shortened attention span.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 3 of 17
Accordingly, there is a growing agreement that there is “a gap between higher education and
21st century skills” [ 21] and that educational institutions should adapt their methodologies [ 24]. Both
the concept itself and the description of the so called “digital natives” have been criticized, lacking
any empirical evidence or substantive characteristics. Kirschner and De Bruyckere [ 16], for example,
harshly criticize this deﬁnition, comparing “digital natives” to Yeti-like creatures: a myth, someone
that everyone talks about but that nobody has ever seen.
A study carried out by Romero, Guitert, Sangr á, and Bullen [ 25], comparing students of di erent
ages, for example, found that older students ( >30 years and thus born before 1984) who exhibited the
characteristics attributed to digital natives more than their younger counterparts.
In their research, 58% of their students, older than 30 showed the characteristics of the so called
“digital natives” more than their younger counterparts.
In terms of learning environment, a study from the University of Barcelona [ 26] concludes that the
“digital native” label does not provide evidence of a better use of technology, rather that technology use
is mainly inﬂuenced by the teaching model. Consequently, in a research on ﬁrst-year undergraduate
students at Hong Kong University, Kennedy and Fox [ 20] found that while students appear to use
a large quantity and variety of technologies for “personal empowerment and entertainment”, they
do always appear digitally literate in using technology to support their learning. This is particularly
evident when it comes to student use of technology as consumers of content rather than creators of
content speciﬁcally for academic purposes” [27] (p. 76).
Adding to this, Shatto and Erwin [ 28] consider that Gen Z students’ ability to obtain information
from online sources seems impressive, but they lack the ability to critique the validity of the information
and, are likely to get frustrated if answers are not clear immediately. Thus, keeping the attention of the
student and developing higher order thinking skills are critical components of successful teaching.
In other words, many students entering university today have a high level of exposure to digital
technologies and media, but they do not seem prepared to cross the bridge between personal and
academic use of technology. Therefore, as academic know-how is gained through formal education,
so too must technological prowess be gained through structured learning experiences [ 28]. For this
reason, it is vital that higher education institutions promote explicit and intentionally reasoned digital
literacy strategies, that combine the optimization of the competencies that both students and teachers
possess as users, with the generation of new competencies [29].
3. Digital Literacy
As previously mentioned, there is a growing agreement that there is “a gap between higher education
and 21st century skills” [ 21] and that educational institutions should adapt their methodology [ 1],
promoting explicit and intentionally reasoned digital literacy strategies, that combine the optimization
of the competencies that both students and teachers possess as users, with the generation of new
competencies [29].
Accordingly, even though digital literacy “has been one of those key concepts whose relevancy and
weight as a key element for a digital citizenship have shifted from being recommended to essential” [ 7],
the concept itself of digital literacy is not standardized, its scope is broad and has been researched from
dierent ﬁelds. The most common approaches so far have been those of media studies, educational
studies, computer science, information science, and librarianship [5].
Due to this, the understanding of this competence can be diverse. On the one hand, the different
understanding of digital literacy responds to the interests and scope of each era of literacy [ 30]. Therefore,
emerging at the end of the twentieth century with the spread of ICT (Information and Communications
Technology), the term mainly referred to computer literacy, that is to say to technological skills, while
with the growing of the “knowledge society”, has highlighted that digital literacy should be understood
as an “inter-related set of skills or competencies necessary for success in the digital age” [ 6]. In particular,
the so-called critical approach has been growing, mainly with the spread of media literacy studies.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 4 of 17
This approach highlights critical thinking as one of the fundamental aspects. Aligning with
Pérez-Tornero’s holistic approach, understanding media literacy as a concept embracing all the ﬁelds
and all the competences related to media, we understand digital literacy as the “acquisition of the
technical competence for using information and communication technologies, understood in a broad
sense, in addition to the acquisition of the basic practical and intellectual capacities for individuals to
completely develop themselves in the Information Society” [5] (p. 30).
Within this framework it is important to recognize that, since there is no unifying deﬁnition of
digital literacy, many models and implementation are possible [ 7]. Accordingly, we will examine our
result within the respective reference framework.
Digital Literacy Development Models
The development of digital literacy in Europe is based in both Spain and Italy on the DigCompEdu
reference framework [31] in which six dimensions are established that teachers must promote for the
development of adequate digital literacy with a series of sub-dimensions as shown below:
1. Dimension 1. Professional engagement, integrating organizational communication, professional
collaboration, reﬂective practice and digital continuous professional development.
2. Dimension 2. Digital Sources resources, including the following subdimensions: selecting, creating
and modifying and managing, protecting and sharing
3. Dimension 3. Teaching and learning, teaching, guidance, collaborative learning, self-regulated
learning.
4. Dimension 4. Assessment within assessment strategies, analyzing evidence, and feedback and
planning.
5. Dimension 5. Empowering learners, embracing accessibility and inclusion, di erentiation and
personalization, and actively engaging learners.
6. Dimension 6. Facilitating learners’ digital competence which includes ﬁve subdimensions: information
and media literacy, communication, content creation, responsible use, and problem solving.
In the context of Ecuador, Digital Agenda 2017–2021 [ 32] establishes 5 dimensions for the promotion
of digital literacy:
1. Dimension 1. Hardware, which includes two subdimensions: connectivity and equipment.
2. Dimension 2. Digital learning, including the following subdimensions: curriculum; learning
methodologies, content and digital sources.
3. Dimension 3. Teachers development, long life learning, pre-service teachers’ education and
professionalization, developing digital competences.
4. Dimension 4. Communication and promotion focusing on visualization, engaging and empowering,
and web content.
5. Dimension 5. Innovation related with developing new skills and competences for teachers and
learners.
The establishment of reference frameworks for the development of digital literacy in both contexts
is very similar, as can be seen in their description, and they are the fruit of a collective awareness of the
need to develop a new literacy according to the context of society of the information. In addition, its
international recognition has implied an e ort in recent years, from organizations, institutions, and
governments so that this change was being put into practice. The objective of the work presented
here is to carry out a speciﬁc temporal approximation (during the quarantine time for COVID-19,
March–April 2020) with a study of the perception of university students to verify whether during this
period of global conﬁnement has sought the development of dimensions that guarantee the acquisition
of digital literacy. To ensure greater signiﬁcance of the results, the study was applied to three countries:
Spain, Italy, and Ecuador, with a high incidence of COVID-19.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 5 of 17
4. Materials and Methods
From the study of the reference frameworks for digital literacy in the three contexts studied (Spain,
Italy, and Ecuador), the study dimensions associated with the variables that would later be included in
the design of the questionnaire were designed, based on the DigCompEdu [ 31] and the Digital Agenda
2017–2020 [32]. Thus, the study dimensions were established as follows:
 Dimension 1 [D1]. Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration: it is related to professional
engagement, the capability to integrate organizational communication, professional collaboration,
and e ective practice and development.
 Dimension 2 [D2]. Digital learning and sources: this dimension is meant to be a rethinking of
conventional sources of learning, complementing the development of other dimensions. It includes
the necessity for citizens to be aware of how to responsibly use, access, and manage digital content .
 Dimension 3 [D3]. Teaching and teachers guidance and skills: Learning strategies will deﬁnitely
develop an appropriate digital literacy by designing, planning, and implanting in the di erent
stages of learning digital tools and technologies.
 Dimension 4 [D4]. Supporting /empowering students: having in mind this is a dimension related
to the development of digital literacy, it will ensure not only access to digital learning resources
and activities but empowering learners and fostering their digital competences.
These dimensions conducted to the deﬁnition of several variables of study for the design of
the questionnaire. The methodological approach followed in this study was quantitative with an
exploratory-descriptive scope [ 33], using three independent socio demographical variables of study
(gender, age, and country) and 20 dependent variables distributed for the analysis of each dimension
as follows: [D1] Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration with four variables; [D2] Digital
learning and sources including six variables; [D3] Teaching and teachers guidance and skills integrating
ﬁve di erent variables; and [D4] Supporting /empowering students with ﬁve variables.
The dimensions and variables deﬁned allow us to specify the purpose of the study, drawing
the following research questions: [RQ1] During lockdown do teachers from the university show
professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation? [RQ2] What kind of sources
have teachers used during the lockdown? [RQ3] Did teachers use new learning methodologies to
guarantee quality in teaching? [RQ4] What was the perception of students about their teacher’s digital
competences? [RQ5] Did students perceive negative aspects in the teaching lessons during lockdown?
[RQ6] Did students feel their education was damaged because of this situation? [RQ7] Did students
feel they had enough digital competence level to face the situation? In the ﬁndings of all research
questions, the analysis and results will o er or not di erences among countries.
Based on this research questions, the following objectives were addressed: (1) ﬁrst, describe the
situation in three countries studied, focusing on the four dimensions designed related to digital literacy,
and, (2) secondly, ﬁnd out if there were signiﬁcant di erences among the three groups studied.
In order to reach the second objective, the hypothesis established were as follows:
Null Hypothesis (H0): There were no di erences among countries in the research questions deﬁned
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): There were di erences among countries in the research questions deﬁned.
This descriptive research applied a comparative study between Spain, Italy, and Ecuador on the
speciﬁc dimensions: consumption of devices and content during the global health crisis of COVID-19,
during the months of March–May 2020. The methodological proposal was designed from an exploratory
perspective and applied the survey instrument, which reached 2956 responses from 376 university
students from Spain, Ecuador, and Italy. In total, the study collected 65,032 pieces of evidence from the
three countries.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 6 of 17
4.1. Sample
The invited sample, conceived as the set of elements of the population that are asked to participate
in the investigation [ 17] corresponds to undergraduate students of Communication, Journalism, and
Education. The study was composed of 376 students aged between 18 and 40 years old (M =21.94;
SD=3.28). As shown in Table 1, the description of the sample was: in Spain, the participation represents
42.3% of the sample (N =159), whose ages range from 18 to 29 years. The students from Italy were the
33.2% (N =125), whose ages average between 18 and 24 years. In the case of Ecuador, 24.5% (N =92),
aged between 18 and 40 years.

23–29 18 (11.32%) 30 (24%) 32 (34.78%) 80 (21.27%)
The research was based on intentional sampling in the selection of the three participating universities.
In this type of sampling, the subjects subjected to analysis and study are chosen by the researcher
to be part of the sample with a specific objective [ 17] as they are considered adequate or suitable for
the investigation. Three universities from different socio-geographical settings were selected, which
received a strong impact from COVID-19, generating significant numbers of affected and deceased in
their territorial environment. In this regard, the institutions that made up the study were: Autonomous
University of Barcelona (Spain) participating with students of the degree of Journalism; University of
Torino (Italy), with the participation of students of the degree of Education, and Technical University of
Machala (Ecuador) that participated in the study with students of the Communication degree.
4.2. Instrument and Procedure
The design of the instrument was carried out with the objective of describing the observed situation
and exploratory analysis of the research questions raised in order to analyze the established dimensions
and find if there were differences among the three groups studied (Spain, Italy, and Ecuador). In the first
phase, the instrument was submitted to the judgment of experts, six in total, academics from the study
area, two in each country, in order to establish clarity and relevance to the items. This first step discarded
a total of 5 items for being redundant or imprecise and allowed six of them to be reformulated. For the
analysis of the reliability of the instrument from the statistical point of view, Cronbach’s Alpha was
carried out for each dimension of the study, all values being above 0.70. The instrument was designed
with Google Forms tool and, prior to its completion, each participant’s permission was requested.
It is important to note that before the data gathering, researchers assured the ethical issues in each
university were addressed. None of the three universities involved required authorization from the
ethics committee due the nature of the study, only the express participant’s permission. The final
instrument consisted of independent variables that collected sociodemographic information and of
dependent variables, a total of thirty-one as can be read in Appendix A, Table A1. Dichotomous
type questions were chosen because of the nature of information the researchers intended to gather.
The dichotomous question format is used when the issue under consideration most likely is thought
of in two possible values [ 18]. Statistical analysis of data was made with package SPSS, version 22,
descriptive and inferential analysis was addressed. In order to check the equality of variances Levene’s
test was applied, which is proper for two or more groups, obtaining a p-value below 0.05 ( p<0.05).
Results confirm there was no normality in the distribution of variables so non parametrical statistics
were required in our study. The study was conducted in two steps in order to reach objectives designed
in the four dimensions: firstly, with basic statistics (frequencies and chi-square test), and secondly,Publications 2020 ,8, 48 7 of 17
to determine the strengths of associations after chi-square, we observed Cramer’s V, (the suitable
measurement in nominal variables) in order to reject or accept null hypothesis, showing which groups
are different or where the groups differ. Accordingly, Norris et al. [ 33] and the interpretation for effect
size (ES) in Social Science in Cramer’s Vshould be considered as follows: ES 0.2 weak; 0.2 <ES0.6
moderate and ES >0.6 strong.
5. Results
In order to establish a clear explanation of results, they are presented as the following in the
dimensions designed, responding in each case to the research questions involved.
5.1. Dimension 1. Teacher’s Professional Engagement and Collaboration
Results for the ﬁrst dimension [D1] were addressed in two steps as previously explained. Firstly,
basic statics such as frequencies and chi-square for signiﬁcance where analyzed in order to extract

dichotomous nominal variables.

In this dimension, the results answer to RQ1: During lockdown, do teachers from the university
show professional collaboration coordinating and addressing the situation? Descriptive statistics for the
ﬁrst dimension show signiﬁcant di erences among countries, for D1.1. Have teachers been well coordinated
among them during the lockdown? So, null hypothesis is rejected. Results show statistically signiﬁcant
dierences among all countries studied conﬁrmed by Cramer’s V: Spain–Italy (S-I) ( 2(1)=12.51 ,
p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.210 which is weak but statistically signiﬁcant (ES 0.2); Italy–Ecuador
(I-E) ( 2(1)=56.22 ,p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.509 moderate (0.2 <ES0.6); and Spain–Ecuador
(2(1)=14.25 ,p<0.005), Cramer’s V =0.679 strong (ES >0.6). D1.2., Have you felt you were not supported
enough? This item only shows statistically signiﬁcant di erences between Spain–Italy ( 2(2)=29.25,
p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V =0.321 moderate (0.2 <ES0.6). D1.3., Have you felt you were properly informed
about your lessons and proceedings? There were no signiﬁcant di erences among countries ( p>0.005),
which means that in this item, null hypothesis is accepted. About last item D1.4., Have you received
contradictory information anytime? Countries that di ered most were Italy–Ecuador ( 2(1)=23.25,
p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V =0.327 and Spain–Ecuador ( 2(1)=14.25, p<0.005 ), Cramer’s V=0.238 which
is moderate in both cases (0.2 <ES0.6).
Focusing on percentages, as seen in Table 2, bigger differences arise in the first and second items.
While Spanish and Italian students consider teachers were not well coordinated among them during the
lockdown, 86.16 and 68.8 percent respectively, in Ecuador students, a percentage of 82.6 consider the
opposite about their teachers. About item D1.2., Have you felt you were not supported enough? The highest
level is for Spain, 80.5 percentage of students have felt that during the lockdown they were not supported
enough from their teachers.
Dierences are evident once more when asking students about their perception about the learning
situation. The Spanish ones declare in a high average that this learning context assumes them a higher
workload, obligating them to be more autonomous and losing contact with classmates. Among ItalianPublications 2020 ,8, 48 8 of 17
students, these issues seem to be less relevant as conﬁrmed in Figure 1, and Ecuadorian are like Spanish

5.2. Dimension 2. Digital learning and sources 
Regarding the second dimension, it is worth noti ng that students were asked ten items to check 
issues related to digital learning and sources during this period in which learning was mediated trough Internet. From D2.1 to D2.3. items (see Tabl e 3), they were asked about what kind of sources 
did teachers use during the lockdown, and from D2.4 . to D2.6. (see Table 3), what sources did they 
prefer for their lessons. As seen in Table 2, some items present differences statistically significant ( p 
< 0.005) among countries, which means we could reject  null hypothesis, it is worth noting that in the 
item D2.5., videos and audiovisuals  as the preferred sources for learning from all students in all 
countries studied who seem to prefer videos an d audiovisual sources for learning (>0.95%).

These results give answer to [RQ2] about the kind of sources teachers have used during the
lockdown. The situation in Spain shows that for 91.19 percent of students, teachers have used texts and
that 95.59 percent of them will prefer video sources and audiovisual materials. Spanish students show
signiﬁcant di erences from Italian (S-I in Table 3) ( 2(1)=66.94, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.486 results
are statistically signiﬁcant between both countries and are also moderately di erent ( 0.2<ES0.6).
Spanish students from Ecuadorian (S-E in Table 3) ( 2(1)=14.98, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.244 show
lower di erences, which indicates to us that in both countries, papers and texts have been the most
used sources. In Italy, the situation seems to be more consistent than in Spain, where 94.4 percent of
students declare that teachers have used video sources and 96.8 percent conﬁrm that they prefer this
kind of materials for learning. Italian students show di erent perceptions from Spanish students inPublications 2020 ,8, 48 9 of 17
item D2.1 (as explained above), and from Ecuadorian students as well (I-E in Table 3) ( 2(1)=14.29,
p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.257. A similar situation occurs in Ecuador with 84.78 percent declaring
teachers used videos and audiovisuals and 96.73 consider these as the best materials for lessons. As an
overview of these results, it is worth noting that 52.2 percent of all students in the sample declared that
materials used for lessons during lockdown were not appropriate. From these responses, 62.3 percent
of them argue that sources were not suitable for distance education, and 15.2 percent said that sources
were boring for distance education.
Responding to research question [RQ4] about if teachers used new learning methodologies
to guarantee quality in teaching, the 77.35, 94.4, and 55.43 percent from Spain, Italy, and Ecuador,
respectively declare that their teachers did not used any of these methodologies.
It should also be noted, as seen in Figure 2, that teachers using new learning methodologies in this
situation did not obtain all positive responses from students, 6.3 percent declare they were unusable
and 15.3 said they were not well designed. We find only 18 percent of students from those who respond
yes (22.34 percent from N =372), finding this innovation “engaging” and 56.8 percent “engaging
and useful”.

The third dimension studied aspects related to te aching and teacher´s guidance and their skills, 
in this regard, results show that students felt a posi tive perception about classes in this situation, 61.7 
percent of the total sample declare they were positive  and 38.3 felt they were negative. If we focus on 
each country, results are similar. As shown in Figu re 3, in Spanish students, 72.32 percent perceive

aspects, only 64.36 percent of students answer ed and only 43.08 percent responded about negative 
aspects. Keeping in mind these results, as could be  seen in Table 4, Italia n (46.26%) and Ecuadorian 
(37.09%) students felt time was better organized and almost half of Spanish students (48.42%) and Ecuadorian ones (42.39%) perceived lessons as similar to face-to-face classes. About negative aspects, it should be noted that there are barely no significant differences ( p > 0.005), confirmed with the 
percentages: 3.26, 5.67, and 5.11 for Spain, Italy, and Ecuador, respectively, in the first negative aspect 
studied; and 40.07, 40.29, and 46.51 in the second unfavorable aspect analyzed. In this case, null 
hypothesis was not rejected, no differences were found in the perception of students in all countries (p > 0.005).

5.2. Dimension 4. Supporting–empowering students 
Empowering students and supporting them is the fourth dimension defined, it is essential for 
an appropriate digital literacy. This dimension ensures the accessibility to learning sources, and the 
use of technologies to foster learners´ active an d creative engagement. In a global situation of 
lockdown, to guarantee this dimension implies offering the opportunity for students to follow personalized learning pathways. The first data analyz ed in this regard do not indicate students have 
felt confident about the situation. From the whol e sample, results show that the 86.2 percent of 
students get the impression of their learning proc ess being damaged because of the situation and the 
way it has been solved. Data from countries reveal similar results, being Spain the country in which students felt more damaged: Spain, 93.08%; Italy, 79.2%; and Ecuador, 83.7%. 
Data collected in Table 5 give response to [RQ6 ]: Did students feel their education was damaged 
because of this situation? From the seven items st udied, two main variables were analyzed: D.4.1.

situation. From the whole sample, results show that the 86.2 percent of students get the impression of
their learning process being damaged because of the situation and the way it has been solved. Data
from countries reveal similar results, being Spain the country in which students felt more damaged:
Spain, 93.08%; Italy, 79.2%; and Ecuador, 83.7%.
Data collected in Table 5 give response to [RQ6]: Did students feel their education was damaged

This situation has damaged your teaching (D4.1.1. to D4.1.4.) and D.4.2 Negative aspects in learning
(D4.2.1 to D4.2.3). Di erences among countries could be observed. In the ﬁrst item, it is worth noting
that 35.8% of Spanish students declared that the quality of teaching was the worst, and similar data for
Ecuadorian students was found that in a percentage of 85.8 said that the learning process was at a
lower level teaching. It also should be noted that half of Italian and Ecuadorian respondents (51.5 and
52.1, respectively) felt that learning was less stimulating, and all of them agreed that this situation lead
to an increase in homework in their daily learning process.

In order to reject or not the null hypothesis (H 0) in variable D.4.1. This situation has damaged your
teaching (D4.1.1. to D4.1.4), after chi-square signiﬁcant di erences for values p<0.005, Cramer’s V
values were observed. For Spain–Italy (S-I in Table 5) ( 2(3)=54.80, p<0.005) we reject null hypothesis,
value for Cramer’s V=0.461 indicates that results are statistically signiﬁcant and are moderately
associated (0.2 <ES0.6). Spanish students felt more damaged than Italian students. Regarding
Italy–Ecuador (I-E in Table 5), signiﬁcant di erences were also observed, 2(3)=40.16, p<0.005,
value for Cramer’s V=0.459, showing that results are statistically signiﬁcant and are also moderately
associated (0.2 <ES0.6). Comparing Spain and Ecuador, signiﬁcant di erences are also appreciated
2(3)=79.70, p<0.005, value for Cramer’s V=0.564.
Regarding the variable D.4.2 Negative aspects in learning (D4.2.1 to D4.2.3), null hypothesis (H 0)
is also rejected. After chi-square showing signiﬁcant di erences, Cramer’s Vexplains the e ect size.
For Spain–Italy (S-I in Table 5) ( 2(4)=43.27, p<0.005), Cramer’s V=0.392 indicates that results are
statistically signiﬁcant and are moderately associated (0.2 <ES0.6). In relation to Italy–Ecuador
(I-E in Table 5) ( 2(4)=90.05, p<0.005) value for Cramer’s V=0.647 show strong association ( ES>0.6),
Italian and Ecuadorian students felt really di erent about this variable. Results in the case of Spanish
and Ecuadorian students (S-E in Table 5) 2(4)=32.77, p<0.005, value for Cramer’s V=0.361 indicate
moderate di erences.
Keeping in mind students had not a very high feeling in the empowering dimension studied,
the following data give more context about the situation, responding to [RQ7] about the students’
perception about their own digital competence level to face the situation. It seems clear observing
Figure 5 that all students participating (n =376) were conﬁdent about their own digital competences.Publications 2020 ,8, 48 12 of 17

Figure 5. Students’ confidence about their ow n digital competence and skills. 
As can be observed in Figure 5, three quarters of all countries felt confident (74.8 percent in 
Spain; 76 in Italy, and 73.9 in Ecuador). These data  are also supported by results in the last questions 
about fake news. To use technologies within a peda gogical purpose is essential for them to have the 
transversal skills needed for deep and critical thin king. In this regard, students in all countries 
declared receiving fake news during the lockdown bu t not almost sharing them as seen in Table 6.

5. Conclusions and Discussion 
Since Glister defined digital literacy in 1997, the concept has been generally accepted and its 
development is inherently merged to educationa l development [34–36]. In this regard, since the 
beginning of this century, changes and challenges in the educational environment such as new 
competencies, new digital media, op en digital sources, digital communication, and critical thinking 
have been related evolving all together in the mu ltidimensional concept of digital literacy [7,37]. 
Already two decades since not only the internatio nal community strives to develop this digital 
Figure 5. Students’ conﬁdence about their own digital competence and skills.
As can be observed in Figure 5, three quarters of all countries felt conﬁdent (74.8 percent in
Spain; 76 in Italy, and 73.9 in Ecuador). These data are also supported by results in the last questions
about fake news. To use technologies within a pedagogical purpose is essential for them to have the
transversal skills needed for deep and critical thinking. In this regard, students in all countries declared
receiving fake news during the lockdown but not almost sharing them as seen in Table 6.

It should be noted the high percentage of students in all countries studied received fake news:
Spain 91.1, Italy 84.8, and Ecuador 96.7. There is no signiﬁcant di erence among countries ( p>0.005) as
observed in Table 6, students mostly respond “Yes” to question D4.10, Have you received fake news during
lockdown? (M=1.1; SD =1) and “no” in question D4.11, Have you shared fake news during lockdown?
(M=1; SD =2).
6. Conclusions and Discussion
Since Glister defined digital literacy in 1997, the concept has been generally accepted and its
development is inherently merged to educational development [ 34–36]. In this regard, since the beginning
of this century, changes and challenges in the educational environment such as new competencies,
new digital media, open digital sources, digital communication, and critical thinking have been related
evolving all together in the multidimensional concept of digital literacy [ 7,37]. Already two decades since
not only the international community strives to develop this digital literacy through education [ 38,39],Publications 2020 ,8, 48 13 of 17
but also all countries and governments around the world [ 30–32], education should ensure digital
literacy whatever modality it acquires.
The aim of this research was to present a comparative-descriptive study analyzing how high
education in three di erent countries has faced the global lockdown situation in terms of ensuring the
development of digital literacy. Having in mind the unusual situation caused by COVID-19 seems to
be a disruption for education [ 39] that will obligate countries and governments to rethink educational
systems, it really makes sense to analyze what has happed during the lockdown situation in order to
face future decisions with empirical information [ 40]. In this regard, it could be said that one of the
limitations of this study is that it only analyzed three countries, future pathways could amplify the
research area in order to study the impact of this situation in a wider perspective.
In line with previous and recent research [ 29,41,42], this study presents an overview of the
development of digital literacy in three di erent contexts: Spain, Italy, and Ecuador. The novelty
in this case is that research is framed in the global lockdown caused by COVID-19, allowing us to
make interesting conclusions for the near future in which the pandemic situation still a ects education
and global health. Dimensions deﬁned and analyzed support ﬁndings and results in line with main
frameworks deﬁning digital literacy [ 30,31,39]. In this regard, we could highlight the following
conclusions from results obtained:
In first place, and regarding dimension one studied, Teacher’s professional engagement and collaboration ,
related to the capability to integrate organizational communication, professional collaboration, and
effective practice and development, results make us conclude that significant differences exist among
the three countries studied. For Spanish and Italian students, teachers have not been well coordinated in
this situation, they felt they were not properly informed and declare receiving contradictory information.
Nonetheless, all samples, Spanish, Italian, and Ecuadorian students, felt they were not supported
enough with statistically significant differences between Spain and Italy, and Spain and Ecuador.
Spanish students were the most disappointed in this regard. This evidence should be interpreted taking
into account, that in March 2020, the Italian government [ 43] announced it would equip schools with
digital platforms and tools for distance learning, lend digital devices to less well-off students, and train
school staff in methodologies and techniques for distance learning. Significant differences are shown as
well among countries in the case of receiving contradictory information, Spanish and Italian students
declared 24 points and 32 points above Ecuadorian students.
About dimension two, Digital learning and sources , analyzed, it can be concluded that digital
sources used during the lockdown by teachers, mainly texts and papers, were not the ones the students
would prefer as digital sources for learning, which were videos and audiovisual materials. Di erences
among countries are interesting in this point, showing that Spain was the county in which teachers
used papers and texts the most and videos and audiovisuals less. This may be one of the reasons for the
high level of displeasure among students from all countries on the way teachers and universities have
addressed the situation. These results are in line with the Organization for Economic Co-operation
and Development Report [ 39] (p. 10) highlighting several universities have “struggled and lacked the
experience and time they needed to conceive new ways to deliver instruction and assignments”.
The third dimension analyzed, Teaching and teacher’s guidance and skills, gives evidence that students
perceive positively the issue following their classes in a distance learning modality, however they perceive
too many negative aspects such as online lessons being too similar to face-to-face classes, not adapting
properly to the online philosophy. In the case of Spain, these results are reinforced in the fact students
felt teachers did not have appropriate skills to manage distance online teaching. Summarizing student’s
perceptions, the situation has given the worst quality of education, less stimulating and boring lessons,
and more homework to do. It is worth noting that no differences were found among countries in this
regard, so in future actions, this dimension should be reinforced and enhanced. Teachers’ digital skills
still continue being a key point in digital literacy development as previous research indicated [21,23].
All international frameworks and mostly nationals highlight dimension four as fundamental for a
proper digital literacy enhancement, Supporting-empowering students . Existing literature also emphasizesPublications 2020 ,8, 48 14 of 17
this area as essential [ 28,29]. This dimension gives them the engagement that ensures the accessibility
to learning sources, and the use of technologies to foster their active and creative engagement [ 44,45].
Results in this dimension have no signiﬁcant di erences among countries studied: Spanish students
felt the most that the quality of teaching was the worst, and Ecuadorian ones think the most learning
process has lower level during the lockdown. About too much work being demanded, Spanish and
Italian students were the most displeased groups. Students felt conﬁdent about their digital skills
and competences to face online distance learning. They all show a mature behavior receiving and
evaluating fake news; they mostly declared getting them but not sharing it at all.
The work presented is found in line with the last report by the OECD, The Future of Education and
Skills, The future we want [38] that constitutes part of the OECD Learning Framework 2030, but focusing
on new concerns related to the development of proper digital literacy during and after COVID-19.
These conclusions give interesting insights from students to face future challenges that the crisis has
brought to light: firstly, universities would need to rethink and reinvent learning environments, not only
based on a digital platform, striving to give learning possibilities through digitalization that expands
and complement students learning; secondly, digital skills and competences should be reinforced in
teachers as a key point in new learning scenarios, and it may be teachers are not ready enough for
digital learning opportunities, so efforts in technology investment are not enough to guarantee learning
for the near future.

Executive summary  
mNutrition in Tanzania  
The mNutrition initiative  is a five -year global programme  supported by t he UK Foreign, 
Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO ), managed  and supported by the GSM 
Association (GS MA), and implemented by in -country mobile network operators (MNOs) and third -
party providers  that seeks  to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of 
children and adults in low -income countries around the world. The mNutrition initiative is 
implemented through existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in 12 countries throughout sub -
Saharan Africa and South Asia.  FCDO  committed to conducting an independent evaluation of the 
mNutrition  initiative . Given the scale of the mNutrition service  the decision was made to select two 
countries for inclusion in the evaluation: the mHealth service  in Tanzania and the mAgri service  in 
Ghana. The mNutrition intervention that is the focus of the evaluation in Tanzania , and of this 
report , is an integrated service that combine d an existing SMS -based health communication 
campaign that target ed pregnant women and mothers of young children , known as ‘Healthy 
Pregnancy, Healthy Baby ’ (HPHB) , with approximately 120  nutrition -focused SMS messages in 
Swahili.  The combined service is called Wazazi Nipendeni  and is managed by Cardno and 
delivered through a platform implemented by Rasello . The combined service  sendsout SMS 
messages timed to the stage of pregnancy or age of child. The service  is designed to  provide 
relevant information for pregnant women and children up to the age of five  in order to affect beliefs 
and behaviours in key nutrition -related areas , including infant and young child feeding (IYCF) and 
women’s dieta ry diversity , in recipient households.  
Evaluation design  
The aim of the impact evaluation is to assess the impact, cost -effectiveness , and commercial 
viability of the mNutrition service. The evaluation is being conducted by a consortium of 
researchers from  Gamos , the Institute of Development Studies ( IDS), and  the International Food 
Policy Research Institute  (IFPRI ), and it relies on a variety of different tools and methods to collect 
evidence on the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania. Broadl y, the evaluation can be 
classified into three distinct but closely integrated components: a qualitative component, a 
quantitative component, and a business model and cost -effectiveness component.   
Given the complexity of the partnerships involved in the m Nutrition projects, Osterwalder and 
Pigneur’s (2010)  inductive approach to business model generation is used as a framework for the 
research (summarised in  Annex C )1. The aim of this endline report is to provide a detailed 
description of each of the building blocks of the business model canvas , based on insights gained 
throughout the duration of the study.  
This business modelling report draws on the quantitative component , which employed a cluster 
randomised controlled trial to identify the causal effect of the service on nutrition knowledge, IYCF 
practices, women’s dietary diversity, and the nutritional status of young children. Surveyed 
households i n villages randomly assigned to the treatment group were offered access to the 
mNutrition content on a mobile phone, free of charge, through a door -to-door, in -person visit; 
households in villages  randomly assigned to the control group did not receive any offer of access 
 
1 The framework is used  to describe a business model in the nine building blocks of the business model canvas. At the 
centre of the canvas is the Value proposition; half of the remaining blocks are customer facing (e.g. customer segments 
and channels), and the other half focus o n the internal workings of the organisation (e.g. activities and partners).  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

to the service.  Baseline and endline surveys were conducted at a two -year interval.  Details of the 
methodology can be found in Gilligan et al., (2019) . 
The history of Wazazi Nipendeni  
The original  GSMA (and FCDO ) vision for the mNutrition p rogramme was to create something 
different to the many exist ing pilots , which  up to that point focused on utilising mobiles and smart 
devices to strengthen health systems .  The intention of the mNutrition programme was  to offer a 
consumer -facing product at scale. The original vision was for a convening space, or clearing 
house, which any party interested in providing health -related services could subscribe to. This 
‘one-stop shop’ would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services : with infrast ructure and 
agreements with MNOs already in place, any institution wishing to set up an mHealth information 
dissemination service (o r other  related value added services (VAS) ) could do so at relatively low 
cost. This concept was ambitiousand centred around  getting potentially competing organisations to 
collaborate. Eventually, timescales conspired against that concept, and GSMA entered into more 
conventional partnerships with mobile operators. They identified in Tanzania an mHealth Tanzania 
Public –Private P artnership (mHealth Tanzania -PPP) which was supporting a consumer - facing 
product for pregnant women called  Wazazi Nipendeni .  The product was something of an 
exception to the original intention  as it was hosted by a public –private partnership (PPP) that, 
although it ha d agreements with four mobile operators, was independent of any single MNO.  
The Wazazi Nipendeni  service (and the mHealth Tanzania -PPP) can trace its roots back to one of 
the earliest information and communication technologies ( ICT) for devel opment pilot projects 
(Voxiva) , funded by InfoDev . The Voxiva system was deployed in 2001 in Peru, and enabled real -
time data collection, data analysis, and dissemination of response information using public 
payphones. When the President’s Emergency Plan f or AIDS Relief  (PEPFAR ) programme was 
launched in 2003, it partnered with Voxiva as part of a consortium in Rwanda.  PEPFAR was keen 
on working with PPPs , and it set up seven multi -country PPPs in 2007, one of which was ‘Phones 
for Health’ , in which Voxiva  and GSMA were partner s (amongst others) . In 2010, the Phones for 
Health programme set up a local PPP in Tanzania and in 2011 the name was changed to the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP. Then Cardno was contracted to manage the mHealth Tanzania -PPP 
under a five -year agreement covering the period 2015 –2020. Most recently, the appointment of a 
health specialist as the team leader signals a shift in the focus of the PPP away from technology 
and towards public health.  
The Wazazi Nipendeni service  
Insights  into the Wazazi Nipendeni service are described using the structure of the Osterwalder 
and Pigneur canvas .  
Customer segments.  The vast majority  of active users (78%)  were women who had given birth . 
Although men are recognised as a key customer segment, supporters (which includes husbands) 
make up only a small proportion of Wazazi Nipendeni users.  
Value proposition. Evidence from the quantitative study confirm s the quality of messages. 
Between 82.7 % and 91.6 % of households read all the mNutrition content they received  and o ver 
90% of users either always or very often found the messages useful , indicat ing that the messages 
are highly valued . Over 90% of users (93.5% of females and 92.2% of males) would recommen d 
the service . 89% of females and 81% of males self -reported implementing at least one tip  and t he Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact vi  
quantitative study confirmed that that access to the service did lead to changes in some nutrition -
related behaviours . 
Channels . In the 2015 Tanzania DHS sur vey, 53% respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni , 
mostly through the r adio. The single largest reason for not receiving messages was that users had 
lost their SIM. Registration data show that up to  83% of users were registered by partners. This 
highlight s the importance of partners in getting users onto the system.  
Customer relationships . Customer relationships are important for acquisition, retention , and 
compliance. Registration data confirm the importance of field partners and the face -to-face 
interac tion they provide in encouraging users to register for the service. Opt -out rates were lower 
among users who had been registered by partners. High levels of satisfaction and perceived 
quality support high retention levels.  
Revenue streams and indirect bene fits. Average revenue per user ( ARPU ) was higher among 
users. Control households spent an average of TZS 5,300 per month (£1.90/month) on mobile 
phone airtime (including any data bundles), but spending was 10% higher (TZS 510, £0.18/month) 
in treatment com munities. The qualitative study found this was due to women becoming more 
confident in using their phones.  There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni had reduced churn.  
Key resources . The content database was brought by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, with additional 
content generated through the mNutrition programme. This nutrition content is regarded as a public 
good, having been paid for by FCDO . In March 2019, CABI made this content publicly available 
under open access through their Knowledge Bank resour ce. The new technology platform offers 
improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities . The key ‘resource’ in 
convening partn erships has been, and will continue to be, the partnership with the Tanzania Food 
and Nutrition Centre  (TFNC ) and its linkages to  both national nutrition policymakers  and health and 
nutrition interventions launching in the country . 
Key activities . Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania -PPP have good networking contacts with 
which  to broker partnerships with fi eld non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) and MNOs. This 
face-to-face field presence is important, given that messages play an important role in reinforcing 
and supporting the efforts of health workers.  TFNC also played an important role in localising 
content. 
Key partnerships . Wazazi Nipendeni  is unique in the complexity of the underlying partnerships. 
Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the resources needed to make the service 
succeed:  Research and design , Content development , Technology platform , Telecoms operators , 
Field partners , Government agencies. During the study, t he mHealth Tanzania -PPP has 
successfully revised agreements with MNOs, negotiated partnerships with new health agencies, 
and migrated the system to a local platform provider,  
Costs and investment . Since the baseli ne study, a more detailed breakdown of costs has been 
provided by partners  and has been used as the basis for the financial analysis.  The per country 
mNutrition budget was just over £1 million (for mHealth projects) but the investment needed to 
replicate t he content was estimated at £312,500 (localising content, user experience (UX) research 
and monitoring and evaluation ). Fixed costs were  dominant, notably administration (staff) and the 
cost of the platform , even when SMS messages were  costed at retail pri ces. 
User numbers . The report includes an analysis of registration data provided by Rasello , which 
contained known anomalies encountered when porting data from the old to the new platforms. A 
‘working’ dataset covers a two -year period between December 2016 and October 2018.  New 
registrations were running at an average of around 20,000/month, whereas people were leaving Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact vii  
the service at less than 1,400/month , i.e. 7% of new users. When combined with the number of 
users already on the service as at November  2016 this gives an estimate of 550,000 active users 
as at Nov ember  2018.  The majority of users (75%) were signed up as pregnant women, 12% were 
general information -seekers, and 3% were supporters of one type or another.  There is a peak in 
registrations of  pregnant women at the three -month mark, which coincides with the first trimester of 
pregnancy . 
Data on the opt -outs suggest that if women used the system throughout their pregnancy, then they 
liked it and continued to use it in motherhood.  Opt-out data te nd to confirm t he TFNC hypothesis  
that women who were assisted with registration might have a stronger commitment to the service, 
stay on the service for longer, be more likely to read the messages, and be more likely to adopt 
improved behaviours.  
Busines s models and sustainability  
Under the current arrangement, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP is funded by public money (from 
international donors), and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by 
the MNOs. The c osts of developing the Wazazi  Nipendeni  service were  covered by  the US Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC ), as part of its public health programmes. The c osts of 
developing the additional nutrition content were  covered by the mNutrition  programme. The service 
is funded and regarded as providing a public good, which it undeniably is.  
In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni , it is difficult to argue a case for financial viability of the mHealth  
Tanzania -PPP because none of the partners generates revenue directly from providing the Wazazi 
Nipendeni  service. Indeed, all parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the 
Government of Tanzania has ruled that all health services should be free to consumers. However, 
the quantitative res earch has found that ARPU increased among users, so it is possible to develop 
a business case for MNOs to provide an mHealth  service on the basis of indirect benefits, should 
this be the model that is transferred to another country. Two hypothetical commer cial models have 
been explored in  detail:  
• Commercial content provider : This speaks to the opportunity for replicating an mHealth 
agency, delivering a service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni, in another country.  At 100% revenue 
share with MNOs (i.e. all TZS 510/user/month in increased ARPU goes to the content 
provider), the model suggests the service would break even at the beginning of Year 3. 
However , the rate of return on investment over a four -year time horizon would be negative. 
Given the assumed trajectory  of growth in user numbers, much greater revenues are 
generated if the timescales can be extended. Therefore, at 100% revenue share, the service 
could generate a positive internal rate of return ( IRR) of 4% over a six-year period. However, 
rate of return i s highly sensitive to revenue share : at 90% revenue share (i.e. the MNO retains 
only 10% of the increase in ARPU), the IRR turns negative.   
• MNO in -house service : There is also a hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO 
in another country sets up  an mHealth service in -house. The key differences from the 
commercial content provider scenario considered above are that the MNO would retain all of 
the additional revenue generated, and there would be no real costs associated with the SMS 
messages sent.  If SMS messages and unstructured supplementary service data  (USSD ) 
sessions are zero -rated, then the service would break even in Year 3, although it would not 
generate enough cash to provide a positive return on investment over a four-year period. 
Assuming the same trajectory of increasing users, the large number of users (rising to 1.1 
million) would generate enough revenue to provide a  19% IRR in a five -year period. However, Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact viii  
it should be noted that Wazazi Nipendeni , as a PPP , has gained users across all four MNOs 
and it is not clear whether an MNO in -house service would reach as many users.  
Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as a national serv ice available through multiple networks and does 
not, therefore, have a particular poverty focus. An MNO providing a service has the flexibility to 
charge SMS and labour at cost price (or lower), which is important for free or low costs services. 
Reach is,  however, limited to customers of the MNO. In a balanced, competitive market, third party 
models can buy SMS from multiple MNOs, which increases their reach in underserved areas 
where only one network is available. Reach is also increased where third party  providers enter into 
agreements with implementing health agencies that focus on vulnerable communities in rural areas 
(B2B models).  
Voice -based services (e.g. outbound dialling) can overcome literacy and language constraints 
among the extreme poor but ar e expensive. The extreme poor could also benefit from emerging 
data based services that use audio and video but these are also expensive and there is a danger 
that they may require a level of digital literacy skills that would render them inaccessible. It would 
appear, therefore, that SMS is the only viable option for free services where minimising cost of 
sales is crucial.  
Conclusions  
• The Wazazi Nipendeni  service offers a strong value proposition to users. It is highly valued by 
users: over 80% of househo lds read the content they received, over 90% of users found the 
messages useful, satisfaction levels were high, and over 80% self -reported implementing at 
least one tip. The quantitative study found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service had 
modestly improved a range of nutritional outcomes, most notably diets among young children.  
• Field partners play a crucial role in providing a face -to-face presence that supports users by 
getting registered, reinforcing messages, and enhancing the effectiveness of t he service.  
• SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women. SMS may be 
particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context, given that literacy levels are relatively high (for 
sub-Saharan Africa), and the country is united by the lang uage of Swahili.  
• It is important to target men with awareness -raising so that they are more likely to permit 
partners to access phones. However, it is less important to enrol men as users on the system.  
• The mHealth Tanzania -PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for reaching the next 
generation of users, given increasing use of smartphones, social media , and the internet.  
• As Wazazi Nipendeni  can trace its roots back to Voxiva in 2001, the study highlights the 
importance of a long history of inve stment, partnerships, and political commitment in nurturing 
a facility to the point where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service 
(and other  service s) at national scale.  
• The ability to broker a complex set of partnerships with a  diverse range of stakeholder groups 
has been crucial to the success of the service. These partnerships have been successful due, 
at least partly, to the personal skills of the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP team.  
• The Wazazi Nipendeni  service yields substantial ind irect benefits to mobile operators in terms 
of increased ARPU. The effect size  had in the quant itative study was at  least a 10% increase in 
ARPU ( TZS 510/month), and is likely to be higher still  at national scale . This is as a result of 
women becoming more confident in their use of phones. There was no evidence that Wazazi 
Nipendeni  users held on to their SIM cards for longer (reduced churn).  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact ix  
• Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni  generates real revenue for operator s opens up 
possibilities for alternative commercial business models. Analysis has focused on two 
hypothetical cases representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency, delivering a 
service similar to Wazazi Nipendeni , in another country. An in -house mHealth service 
developed by an MNO appears to be the most attractive proposition for two key reasons. 
Firstly, all of the increase in revenue is retained by the MNO , and secondly, the real cost to an 
operator of sending SMS messages is minimal. Based on an initial investment of £312,500 to 
cover the cost of product development (UX research, monitoring and evaluation, content 
localisation), a scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs, ARPU and the 
effect size (increase in ARPU), indicate s that a service could provide an IRR of approximately 
70% over a four-year period.  
• Less attractive, although possibly still viable, is an independent content provider model; the 
provider would need to pay a bulk SMS price for all messages sent, and it would need to share 
revenue with each participating operator. A scenario based on posit ive assumptions on 
operating costs, ARPU and the effect size (increase in ARPU), and revenue share (50%) 
indicates that a service could only provide a positive IRR over a 6 -year period.  However, it is 
unlikely that an aggregator could convince an MNO to sh are ‘increased ARPU’ – as an indirect 
benefit ; tracking and allocating such would be a challenge.  
• The business model continues to be a multi -sided platform business model that provides value 
to funders with a health mandate ( Ministry of Health, Community D evelopment, Gender, Elderly 
and Children ( MoHCDGEC ) and CDC) , who pay for the service, thereby enabling users to 
access it free of charge. As the MoHCDGEC  assume s responsibility for more of  the activities 
conducted by the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, the business  model will tend towards a hybrid of a 
government -to-citizen model and the multi -sided platform.  
• Despite vulnerabilities of the current business model to continued funding from CDC, and free 
SMS messages donated  by MNOs , the model articulated by the mHealt h Tanzania -PPP 
appears to be sustainable . The mHealth Tanzania -PPP continues to enter into agreement s 
with new public health programmes , recent policy documents suggest that continued donor 
funding is likely to be forthcoming , and negotiations with CDC for  renewed donor funding are at 
an advanced stage . There may be merit, therefore , in the donor funded business model.  
• In the event that a health information service provider is permitted to levy charges (e.g. in other 
countries), p ossible mechanisms for revenue generation include charg ing NGO/ gov ernment  
clients , sponsoring of messages as a form of advertising (e.g. by fast moving consumer goods  
(FMCG ) companies), and commission from sales of private health sector financial products  
(e.g. life insurance) . 
• Telecommunications companies have come under pressure from the Government of Tanzania 
as part of its anti -corruption campaign. Companies have been required to make shares 
available to the Tanzanian public, and several mobile compani es have been charged with a 
range of charges, including tax evasion. Support for Wazazi Nipendeni  has political capital in 
this context, and operators have now signed agreements directly with MoHCDGEC , rather than 
indirectly with the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP. Previously, operators’ promotion of Wazazi 
Nipendeni has been weak so they should be supported to capitalise on the positive brand of 
Wazazi Nipendeni . 
• Although SMS remains an appropriate medium for reaching women, data -based services may 
split the market.  Emerging mHealth services exploit the potential of the internet, of 
smartphones, of data acquisition and analysis, and of mobile money services.  This is 
consistent with trends in the telecoms market of g rowth in data and mobile money . mHealth Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact x  
services wil l need to be agile as they incorporate emerging technologies into their service 
offering.

1 Introduction  
1.1 mNutrition  
mNutrition is a global initiative supported by FCDO , managed by  GSMA, and implemented by in -
country MNOs  and third party providers  to use mobile technology , that s ought  to improve the 
health and nutritional status of children and a dults in the developing world. The potential to utilise 
mobile technology to change attitudes, knowledge, behaviours, and practices around health and 
agriculture for improved nutritional status has been recognised for some time, but to date there 
have been  no rigorous evaluations of m -services at scale. A consortium of researchers from 
Gamos, IDS, and IFPRI were  contracted to conduct a rigorous mixed -methods evaluation to 
estimate the impact of mNutrition on children and adults , and to understand how the co ntext and 
the components of the mNutrition intervention shape its impact.  
In Tanzania, the service, Wazazi Nipendeni, focuse d on the provision of nutrition and health 
information and services to vulnerable pregnant women and caregivers of children under t he age 
of five on their mobile phones , with the goal of improving nutrition outcomes and behaviours for 
mothers and young children.  
1.2 Objectives   
The mNutrition evaluation intends  to understand and measure the impact, cost -effectiveness , and 
commercial viabi lity of the mNutrition product using a mixed -methods evaluation design. The 
evaluation includes a quantitative component, a qualitative component , and a business model 
analysis. The evaluations were  conducted by a c onsortium of researchers from Gamos , IDS , and 
IFPRI. The team  drew  on a number of methods and interlinked workstreams to gather evidence 
about the impact of the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania : 
• a quantitative impact evaluation , employing a cluster randomis ed controlled trial  to determine 
the causal  effect of the service ;  
• a qualitative impact evaluation , which consists of three qualitative data collection rounds (i.e. 
an initial exploratory qualitative study, in -depth case studies at midline , and rapid explanatory 
qualitative  work after the quantitative endline survey data collection) , which  aims to provide an 
understanding of the context, underlying mechani sms of change , and the implementation 
process of mNutrition ; and  
• a business model and cost -effectiveness evaluation  emplo ying stakeholder interviews, 
commercial and end -user data, document analysis , and evidence from the quantitative and 
qualitative evaluations to generate a business model framework and  to estimate the wider 
imputed benefits from the VAS for the range of sta keholders involved.  
The mixed -method evaluation design aims to address the following research questions  specified in 
the terms of reference ( Annex A ): 
1. What are the impacts and cost -effectiveness of mobile phone -based nutrition and agriculture 
services on nutrition, health, and livelihood outcomes, especially among women, children, and 
the extreme poor?  
2. How effective are mobile phone -based services in reaching, increasing the knowledge, and 
changing the behaviour of the specific target groups?  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 2  
3. Has the process of adapting globally agreed messages to local contexts led to content that is 
relev ant to the needs of children, women, and poor farmers in their specific context?  
4. What factors make mobile phone -based services effective in promoting and achieving 
behaviour change (if observed), leading to improved nutrition and livelihood outcomes?  
5. How c ommercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level?  
6. What lessons can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile 
phone -based nutrition services to ensure (a) behaviour change and (b) continue d private  sector 
engagement in different countries?  
1.3 Research questions of the business modelling component  
The business model and cost -effectiveness component of the evaluation is designed to contribute 
evidence to help answer the first of the broad resear ch questions specified in the terms of 
reference (Annex A ), and can be considered as specific to the following research questions : 
• What are the impacts and cost -effec tiveness of mobile phone -based nutrition services on 
nutrition, health and livelihood outcomes, especially among women, children and the extreme 
poor?  
• How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level?  
• What lessons  can be learned about best practices in the design and implementation of mobile 
phone -based nutrition services to ensure (a) behaviour change and (b) continued private sector 
engagement in different countries?  
The mNutrition intervention is being external ly evaluated in two countries.  In Tanzania, where the 
research consortium is evaluating mNutrition within a broader mHealth service , the intervention 
aims to promote behaviour change around maternal and early childhood health and nutrition. The 
target grou p of the quantitative component was  therefore comprised of pregnant women and 
caregivers of children under the age of five years who reside in rural areas of the study region 
(Iringa).  In Ghana, the intervention was implemented via an mAgri culture programm e in which 
nutrition information has been integrated with crop information as part of a package of agriculture 
support services.  The target group were  low-income farmers in rural areas throughout the country.  
The terms of reference refer to the impacts and effectiveness of mobile phone -based services, so 
the scope of the evaluation is the mobile -based service as deployed under the mNutrition 
programme, rather than the incremental impact of support provided through the mNutrition 
programme.  For th e quantitative sample of pregnant women and caregivers of young children in 
rural Iringa that were  selected to participate in the quantitative study, the evaluation focuses on 
estimating the causal effect of access to the mNutrition service .  
The business modelling relies on other components in the evaluation study. To determine whether 
the mNutrition programme  in Tanzania  was meeting its stated objectives and targets, the 
quantitative impact evaluation employ ed a cluster randomis ed controlled tria l to determine the 
causal  effect of the service. That is, the evaluation identif ied how nutrition -related behaviours, 
knowledge, and outcomes were  altered for service beneficiary households relative to their 
counterfactual levels: it sought to determine what the value of the outcome would have been for 
beneficiary households in the absence of access to the mNutrition service . While the quantitative 
evaluation was designed to produce evidence to contribute to the broader research consortium’s 
answers to the first two questions listed in the terms of reference , IFPRI also specified a set of 
primary and secondary research questions that were  answered using information  collected by the 
quantitative research team. For each of the primary and secondary research questions, the 
evaluation focuse d on estimating the causal impact of the offer of access to the mNutrition service  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 3  
and of registration for  the mNutrition content  among households induced to participate in the 
service by the treatment offer . The primary research questions addressed through the quantitative 
evaluation were : 
1. What is the impact of the mNutrition service  on women’s dietary diversity?  
2. What is the impact o f the mNutrition service  on IYCF  practices?  
3. What is the impact of the mNutrition service  on nutritional status for children under 12 
months of age at baseline?  
The three primary research questions specify the main outcomes that were studied under the 
quant itative component of the evaluation. These directly contribute to answering the first overall 
study question of the mNutrition evaluation (see Section 1.2, above). T he impact questions feed 
into the cost -effectiveness analysis presented here.  
The intended audience for the business modelling endline report is FCDO , along with other 
organisations involved in mNutrition and mHealth programmes globally (including local MN Os and 
non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) implementing mNutrition services), national 
governments —in particular, MoHCDGEC  and TFNC  in Tanzania —international agencies and 
donors, and community -level health workers.  It should also be of interest to MNOs that are 
implementing or considering implementing a similar service. The reports from the evaluation will be 
publicly available on IFPRI’s and IDS’s websites.  
1.4 Purpose and scope of the business modelling endline report  
This report is a milestone in the evaluation study : it documents the journey of the Wazazi 
Nipendeni  service in Tanzania  supported by GSMA (and FCDO ) over the duration of the 
evaluation. The report is one of four endline deliverables. This report should be read in conjunction 
with the base line business modelling report (Batchelor  et al., 2017) , the endline cost -effectiveness 
report (Batchelor  et al., 2019) , and the quantitative endline report (Gilligan et al., 2019), which 
provides evidence of  the impact of access to the service on both primary and secondary outcomes. 
The qualitative endline report (Barnett et al., 2019 )2 gives additional insights into consumer 
priorities and behaviours and how the service was used.  
The baseline business modellin g report covered the initial data gathering stage (up to March 
2017). At this point, the GSMA grant was finishing,  but the service continued to develop as it had 
had received direct funding through the mNutrition programme, so progress was in no way 
depend ent on the mNutrition support.  
The findings from the four endline deliverables described above will be combined and triangulated 
in a workshop planned for 20 20. The two -day workshop will examine the insights from the 
quantitative, qualitative, cost -effect iveness , and business modelling components of the evaluation 
and will be attended by the lead partners from IDS, IFPRI , and Gamos responsible for each of 
these components. The main purpose of the workshop will be to disseminate learnings from the 
impact ev aluation in Tanzania .

1.5 Organisation of the report  
Section 2 describes the mNutrition intervention in Tanzania while section 3 describes the broader 
evaluation design.  The business modelling narrative tracks changes that have occurred during the 
course of t he study, and  the reasons behind the decisions made, so Section 4 starts by reviewing 
the thinking behind the mNutrition programme and by exploring the history of the mHealth  
Tanzania -PPP. The business modelling canvas is reviewed in Section 5, partly by summarising 
findings from the baseline report, bu t enhanced with further details gathered in the intervening 
period. The mHealth Tanzania -PPP managed to source registration data requested by the team, 
and so, based on these data,  the analysis  presented  in Section 6 provides insights into growth 
trends, how people use the service, and the importance of partners. Estimates of active user 
numbers from this analysis form the basis of the financial model used to explore the financial 
viability of the current business model , as well as hypothetical scenarios that represent possibilities 
for setting up a similar service in another country (Section 7). Telecoms is an important and 
dynamic market, and Section 8 presents an overview of key developments that have taken place 
during the study  period , focusing on the political economy and technical developments. Finally, 
Sections 9 and 10 present a discussion of key issues raised in the report, along with a set of 
conclusions and learnings.

2 The mNutrition intervention  
The mNutrition initiative is a five -year global programme supported by FCDO , managed  and 
supported by GSMA, and implemented by in -country MNOs and third-party organisations , that 
seeks to use mobile technology to improve the health and nutritional status of children and adults 
in low -income countries around the world. The mNutrition initiative was implemented through 
existing mAgri and mHealth programmes in 12 countries throughout sub -Saharan Africa and South 
Asia. The nutrition content aim ed to promote behaviour change around key farm ing practices and 
around dietary and child feeding practices likely to result in improved nutritional health within a 
household.  
In Tanzania, the mNutrition service that is the focus of the evaluation and  of this report was an 
integrated programme that enhance d an existing SMS -based health communication campaign 
targeting pregnant women and mothers of young children , known as HPHB . The mass media 
programme accompanying the service is called Wazazi Nipendeni. The Wazazi Nipendeni 
programme is a CDC -funded pr oject bringing together multiple partners contributing towards 
shared goals. Phase 1 of the service, launched in 2012, was initially developed in coordination with 
the Tanzania Capacity Communication Project, a United States Agency for International 
Develo pment  (USAID) funded service led by JHCCP. Wazazi Nipendeni is one of several 
behaviour change services using methods as diverse as TV drama series, radio distance learning 
for community health volunteers , and several integrated mass media campaigns. The m ass media 
campaign was developed by JHCCP, while the SMS component of the campaign is led by the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP. The PPP was initiated by MoHCDGEC, with financial support from CDC. 
Wazazi Nipendeni is available nationally and on all phone networks.  
The HPHB SMS service sen t free text messages with healthcare information to pregnant women, 
mothers with newborns, and male supporters and general information -seekers in Tanzania to drive 
health -seeking behaviour. The SMS messages were sent in Swahili, to w omen up to 16 weeks 
post-partum on a range of pregnancy and early childhood issues , timed to coincide with the stage 
of the pregnancy and the age of the child. Anyone interested in receiving healthy pregnancy 
information can text the word ‘MTOTO’ (child) t o the short code 15001. Registrants receive 
instructional messages, allowing them to indicate the woman’s current week or month of 
pregnancy (or the age of the newborn baby) during the enrolment process. This process allows the 
recipients to receive specif ic text messages relevant to the time and stage of pregnancy or early 
childhood. The message frequency also varies depending on the life stage of the woman and child, 
ranging from nearly daily during key periods of pregnancy to less than weekly for mothers  of 
children over the age of two. Nutrition -related content was a small component of the original HPHB 
SMS service but was expanded substantially with the addition of the content contributed through 
GSMA under the mNutrition service. mNutrition added rough ly 120 nutrition messages , which are 
delivered to mothers or caregivers of children up to five years old. At the beginning of the study 
period , HPHB and mNutrition were available to households in all regions of Tanzania, on all mobile 
phone networks . Participating individuals receive the text messages free of charge. The resulting 
product is referred to as the mNutrition service in the remaining sections of this report.  
The 120 nutrition messages included in the mNutrition service were  drawn from 42 factsheets on 
nutrition -related behaviours identified as key determinants of outcomes that were developed by the 
Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition ( GAIN ) together with local partners:  the Centre for 
Counselling, Nutrition and Health Care  (COUNSENUTH) and Every1mobile. The information 
contained in these factsheets was then adapted to the context of Tanzania and made mobile -ready 
by the local content providers under the guidance of MoHCDGEC and TFNC. As a part of the 
adaptation process , the message content was tested with potential users in Tanzania, after which Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 6  
the language and substance were adjusted and messages that were identified as not being useful 
were removed from consideration for the final service. The message testing process high lighted 
the importance of replacing technical terminology that was likely to be unfamiliar to the message 
recipients with language that was more commonly used but that still conveyed the evidence -based 
content of the original factsheets. Included in the fi nal service are messages that encourage the 
consumption of iron folic acid tablets during pregnancy and messages that promote vitamin A -rich 
complementary feeding practices , and the inclusion of animal source foods in young children’s 
diets, as well as mes sages providing information on other behaviours accepted as being critical 
determinants of nutrition outcomes. For more details on the intervention, see the baseline report 
(Gilligan  et al.,  2018) . 
2.1 Study region context  
The United Republic of Tanzania is an East African nation with an estima ted population of 57.3 
million (2016), 68 % of whom reside in rural areas (World Bank , 2018) . As at 2018, 64 % of working -
age males and 69 % of working -age females were employed in agriculture (International Labour 
Organizati on, 2018) , with the main agricultural export commodities including tobacco, cashew nuts, 
coffee, cotton, and sesame seed (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations , 2018) . 
Tanzania is divided into 31 regions and regions are further subdivided into a total of 169 districts. 
Child undernutrition is a pervasive problem in Tanzania, particularly among young children. In the 
2016 DHS, 34.4 % of children under five were identified as being stunted (height -for-age z -score 
below -2). Wasting is less common, with only 4.4 % of measured children under five having a 
weight -for-height z -score below the -2 threshold. Ov er half (57.7 %) of measured children between 
6 and 59 months of age are anaemic (DHS, 2016) . 
The quantitative and qualitative components of the evaluation took place within the three rural 
districts of the Iringa region in Tanzania: Iringa rural, Kilolo, and Mufindi.  Figure 1 displays the 
location of Iringa region in Tanzania. Iringa became an independent region in 1964, b efore which it 
was a part of the Southern Highland Province. As at the 2012 Population and Housing Census, the 
total population of Iringa region was estimated to be 0.9 million, 73 % of whom resided in a rural 
area. Agriculture is the primary means of livel ihood for most households in the rural parts of Iringa 
region: roughly 89 % of households in Iringa rural, 92 % of households in Mufindi, and 92 % of 
households in Kilolo are involved in agriculture. At the time of the census, a verage household size 
was 4.2 a nd the adult literacy rate was 79 % among the rural population (Population and Housing 
Census , 2012) . In Tanzania more broadly, ch ild undernutrition is a severe problem in Iringa. 41.6 % 
of children under the age of five in the 2016 DHS were stunted. This figure was nearly 7 
percentage points higher than the national average, suggesting child malnutrition may be more 
prevalent in Irin ga than elsewhere in Tanzania. Additionally, 3.6 % of children under five were 
wasted and 40.3 % of children aged 6–59 months of age were anaemic.  
In part, Iringa was selected as the location for the study because of a dearth of existing 
relationships betwee n mHealth Tanzania -PPP and organisations with a presence in the region. 
Consistent with this, the mNutrition baseline qualitative report found that households in study 
villages typically rely on health workers at local health clinics and community health w orkers for 
their nutrition information needs. Often the information from health clinic workers is received during 
antenatal visits, which also involve the provision of non -nutrition -related information, testing, and 
other services, sometimes leaving little  time for issues related to nutrition (Barnett  et al. , 2017) . 
Though at the start of the study there was limited availability of nutrition information and nutrition 
services, the Government of Tanzania has prioritised improving nutrition outcomes nationwide 
through different initiatives —see more detail in the basel ine report (Gilligan et al. , 2018) . Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

2.2 Summary of the quantitative component approach  
The quantitative evaluation was designed as a cluster randomi sed control trial, with two stages of 
randomi sation : a village -level randomi sation where villages were assigned to a treatment group or 
to a control group , and a household -level randomi sation within treatment villages whereby 
households were  either assigned to receive the mNutrition content on just the mobile phone of the 
primary female or on the mobile phones of both th e primary female and the primary male . In 
villages that were assigned to the treatment group, sampled households were offered access to 
the mNutrition content on their mobile phone, free of charge, through a door -to-door, in -person 
visit. In villages that were assigned to the control group, no offer of access to the service  was 
made. Though registration for the mNutrition service  was possible for all households  regardless of 
treatment assignment , pre-baseline discussions with the organisation implementing t he mNutrition 
service in Tanzania suggested that take-up of the ir existing  service  was low in the study region .  
From the randomly selected sample of villages participating in the evaluation, IFPRI randomly 
assigned households in half the villages to a tre atment group (T) —where sampled households 
received a door -to-door offer of access to the content —and households in the other half of 
participating villages to a control group (C) that did not receive a similar offer. Because the 
assignment of villages was random, any average difference in outcomes between households in 
the two groups can be attributed to the difference in access to the mNutrition service.  
In addition to the village -level randomisation , the evaluation also included a second -stage 
household -level randomisation within treatment villages : households in treatment villages where 
both the mother of the young child or pregnant woman (the primary female) and the primary male  
own distinct mobile phones (and were surveyed) were randomly allocated to ei ther just receive the 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 8  
mNutrition content on the mobile phone of the primary female (T -F), or to receive the mNutrition 
content on the mobile phone of the primary female and the mobile phone of the primary male (T -
F+M). By comparing behaviours and outcomes between treatment households in the T -F+M group 
and those in the T -F group , and contrasting both the T -F and the T -F+M group to households in 
control villages that would have been eligible for the household -level randomisation , it was 
expected that learnin g would be generated about how information flows between spouses.  
2.3 Summary of the qualitative component approach  
The sample selection for the qualitative study was purposive and based on the quantitative 
baseline data. Three sites were selected from the sam ple of 90 treatment villages . At community 
level, the main data collection tools were semi -structured in -depth interviews with treatment 
mothers and fathers (i.e. mothers and fathers who were signed up to receive Wazazi Nipendeni  
plus mNutrition messages ) by the Oxford Policy Management ( OPM ) Tanzania  team during the 
quantitative baseline survey, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions with treatment 
mothers and fathers and elderly women.  In-depth interviews were conducted with mothers who 
had signed up to receive the Wazazi Nipendeni  mNutrition service on their phone or their partners’ 
mobile phone as part of the baseline survey.  In-depth interviews  were also conducted with fathers 
whose partners were signed up to the service, who received me ssages on behalf of or in addition 
to their wives.  Key informant interviews were conducted with influential and knowledgeable people 
in each village, including village chairmen and/or community health workers. The purpose was to 
explore their knowledge, aw areness , and opinion s of the mNutrition messages that people in the 
community had been receiving, and to capture information on current contextual issues relating to 
maternal and child nutrition.  Focus group discussions were carried out with four or five p articipants 
per group. The aim was to select heterogeneous groups of mothers (by occupation, age, number 
of children) who had signed up to the Wazazi Nipendeni  plus mNutrition service.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

3 Evaluation design  
3.1 Study design  
This report is constructed based on  interviews with key stakeholders and access to secondary 
data.  A list of contacts made can be found in Annex B.  
The study has used the Osterwalder and Pigneur framework  to structur e insights into the business 
model (Osterwalder and Pigneur, 2010).  Few business  models in the 21st century are 
straightforward and simple.  Production of a product, sales of the product , and revenue from that 
product are only a part of the overall model.  Revenues are often made based on associated 
advertising, or on the value the product adds to the brand.  The landscape report published as part 
of this study details some of the possibilities for MNOs (Barnett et al., 2016).  
In this report, we use the Osterwalder and Pigneur  canvas as a basis for the analysis . An 
introduction to the  framework is given in Annex C . While this generally works well, we acknowledge 
that the canvas is good for taking a snapshot of business model s, but in this report documenting 
the timeline and history of the product is important.  These business model insights are intended to 
answer the key research question: ‘How commercially viable are the different business models 
being employed at country level? ’  
In a development  sector in which  public funds are increasingly under scrutiny for value for money, 
the rollout of a public good via a private sector commercially sustainable mechanism is very 
attractive.  The heart of the question  just quoted  is predicated on assuring that  future actions taken 
by donors and  the private sector regarding similar products are informed and lessons are learned, 
in order to increase the chances of sustainability.  Hence , while we try to use the Osterwalder and 
Pigneur  framework in an applied manne r, there are times when  we have document ed the ‘back 
story’ that lay behind certain decisions.  
The aim of the baseline report was to provide a detailed description of each of the building blocks 
of the business model canvas as at the  time of  the beginning of the independent study. That report  
also provide d a review of operating experience since the beginning of the mNutrition projec t, on the 
basis that that may have provide d the context for changes that had taken place in the product 
design.  This report builds on the baseline, bringing the canvas up to date.  
3.2 Data collection methods  
The endline report is based on information collected  from multiple sources:  
• qualitative interviews conducted with stakeholders and MNOs in Tanzania ;  
• commercial data provided by stakeholders and MNOs (or brokered by GSMA) ;  
• monitoring data gathered by Altai; 
• data available in published literature ; 
• additional, unpublished information on costs and business models  from g overnment 
stakeholders and alternative service providers ; 
• the quantitative component of the study, led by IFPRI  (Gilligan  et al., 2019) ; and  
• the quali tative component that focused on consumer perceptions, led by IDS (Barnett et al., 
2019) . Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 10  
3.2.1  Processing information  
Evaluation activities carried out by Gamos to inform the endline report s include d the following : 
• Field visits to establish and maintain relati onships with key stakeholders. Interviews conducted 
with key representatives of stakeholder institutions to gather additional data to populate the 
Osterwalder and Pigneur framework. Ongoing communication and field visits undertaken to 
monitor developments in services and to track the commercial justification for changes.  
• Populating the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas with information gleaned from reports 
previously published under the mNutrition programmes (e.g. UX testing, case studies, rapid 
feedback surve ys, etc.), as well as grey literature.   
• Working with IDS and IFPRI to contribute to the design of both qualitative and quantitative 
instruments (both baseline and endline) to incorporate indicators relating to non -financial 
attitudes of customers to servic es, and to MNOs in particular, such as customer satisfaction 
and brand loyalty. These instruments also explore d attitudes towards alternative services 
offered by other providers, e.g. media, face -to-face extension.  
• Interview ing alternative service provide rs to explore alternative business models (among 
alternative mobile services).   
• Analysing financial data with a view to creating a financial model to test key cost sensitivities . 
The process of enquiry and information collection was flexible and responsive to events on the 
ground, given that the service offerings were constantly evolving  (e.g. the publication of significant 
outputs from the research project ). This component of the evaluation is  therefore  based on 
opportunistic gathering of data from key individuals , such as representatives of the core partners 
and other partners to the project.  
3.3 Ethical considerations and approval  
As an overall guiding principle, the research team sought to conduct themselves in a professional 
and ethical manner throughout the work, with strict respect for  the principles of integrity, honesty, 
confidentiality, voluntary participation, impartiality , and the avoidance of personal risk. These 
principle s were informed by the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development 
(OECD ) (2010) Development Assistance Committee Quality Standards for Development 
Evaluation and FCDO ’s ‘Ethics Principles for Research and Evaluation’ , which have been  followed 
for the duration of the evaluation.   
Overall, this component draw s on the qualitative and quantitative data collected in the other two 
components of the evaluation , which have their own ethical protocols.  The key business modelling  
data sources are stakeholder interviews with MNOs and data collection (commercial and 
monitoring data) from MNOs and other relevant organisations.  
Although most research participants were  familiar with the mNutrition programme, and with the 
principle of a n independent evaluation, this component sought  to obtain the  informed consent of 
participants. This was achieved by  sending them  emails and briefing documents describing the 
research.  In particular, we describe d the relationship between the consortium, FCDO, and GSMA, 
in order to avoid any possibility of deception.  Research activities with participants involve d 
interviews only; there were no observational activities.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 11  
While this evaluation component has not involve d any primary data collection from human su bjects 
at community/ household level, ethical considerations are still considered important for all work 
carried out under this component. In particular, GSMA remain highly aware of the commercial 
sensitivities of their partner MNOs, so the issue of commer cial confidentiality is very important for 
this area of work , given that it relies on the sharing of sensitive commercial data. Therefore, the 
Gamos team has paid specific attention to this issue as part of their ongoing work.   
The Gamos  team is currently operating under the non-disclosure agreement signed by GSMA and 
OPM during the inception phase of the project.  Where relevant, stakeholder respondents were 
informed that a  non-disclosure agreement with their trade association has been si gned, and that 
the interview was bound by it.  All the data being gathered fell within the scope of this agreement 
(e.g. development, business plans, marketing, operations, and finances) although there is a 
provision that such information should be designat ed as proprietary or confidential .3  
For the avoidance of doubt, all internal reports shared by Gamos were marked as confidential and 
were not to be circulated outside of the evaluation team.  Any outside reporting will not contain any 
detail that could be  construed as proprietary or confidential information.  
All external reports were and will be shared with key research participants in early draft form in 
order to establish principles of trust and reciprocity.  This is to ensure that participants have  an 
opportunity to confirm that their views have been reported accurately, and that publications do not 
breach their confidentiality requirements.  
As this component draws on qualitative and quantitative data collected through the other two 
workstreams, appropri ate measures were  taken to ensure that the shared data are anonymised 
and there is no risk of confidentiality breach. For the quantitative data, a unique household ID has 
been assigned to each household which allows for following up with respondents as necessary 
without providing access to any personal information  on datasets that are made available for 
analysis. Similarly, all qualitative transcripts are anonymised  and pseudonyms given, and any 
information that can lead to personal identification has been removed.  
3.4 Limitations  
The methodology relie d on the willingness of key stakeholders to share their data and their 
thoughts.  In a commercial environment , this is not always forthcoming, and a limitation of the report 
is that it relies on these shared data. Risks associated with this transfer of data have been 
mitigated as much as possible by clear communication and follow -up with stakeholders. 
Sensitivities among the major mobile operators, along with structural changes and turnover of staff , 
made it difficult for GSMA and the study team to build rela tionships with MNOs.  Changes in 
relationships and personnel (among all stakeholders) were the principal threats to the mitigation 
strategy. The mHealth Tanzania -PPP has been instrumental in securing the data used in the 
report.  
 
 
3 The agreement permits Gamos  to share confidential information among the team if: 1. they need to know; 2. they have 
entered into a confidentiality agreement; and 3. they are not a competitor.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

4 Wazazi Nipendeni – the back ground  
4.1 The vision for mNutrition  
The original GSMA (and FCDO ) vision was to create something different in mHealth.  They had 
seen many mHealth pilots that utilised mobiles and smart devices to strengthen the health system 
of various countries and to offer a consumer -facing product  at scale . Many pilots existed, but few if 
any, scaled activities that were coordinated with the health service nationwide.  The terms of 
reference state that under the mNutrition programme, GSMA was to provide assistance to MNOs 
and partnerships to scale up services ( Annex A ); FCDO ’s vision, then, was to create a service that 
could achieve scale by being made available to MNO subscribers.  
GSMA’s original vision was for a convening space, or clearing house, which a ny party interested in 
providing health -related services could subscribe to.  The complexion of the institution that would 
manage the clearing house was not specified.  It could be some kind of collaborative membership 
organisation, or it could be managed by  a private sector organisation, typically an aggregator (it 
would anyway require an aggregator to set up the links to each of the MNOs in the country). The 
key feature of this vision was that it would lower the barriers of entry to mHealth services – the 
infrastructure and agreements with MNOs would already be in place so any institution wishing to 
set up an mHealth service could use the arrangement to send mobile -based information at 
relatively low cost.  By creating a focal point for mHealth services opera ting within the country, it 
would also promote coordination, collaboration, and sharing of resources, thereby helping to 
address the all too frequent complaint of duplication of effort. By devolving responsibility for 
content, including the nature of the services to be made available by participating organisations, 
the concept had the potential to support the dissemination of diverse content, and to support 
innovative mechanisms for reaching resource -poor mobile phone users.  
The system was expected to work  as follows:  
1. The managing institution would secure a short code valid on all networks.  
2. The first time users would dial into the system, they would be guided through a series of menus 
and questions to complete their profile.  They would then be routed to re levant information 
based on their profile (e.g. gender, pregnant mother, or mother of child under two). Once 
routed to relevant menus, they would be presented with options regarding which type of 
information they wanted to receive, and within that type of information, they could choose from 
relevant content providers.  
3. Once they had chosen the content provider, the profiling information would be sent to that 
content provider, and the user would be signed up to that partner’s service (which may or may 
not in clude further profiling).  
Services were to be made available on a freemium basis, i.e. certain information was to be 
available to users for free, and they would need to pay for other, premium content. The nutrition 
messages, generated as part of the GSMA mNutrition programme, were to be made available as 
free messages.  
In early 2015, GSMA was negotiating with Green Telecom, a Tanzanian private sector company 
that had been founded just over a year  earlier , about a role as a nutritional messaging service . It 
appeared to offer a good fit with the kind of partner that GSMA was looking for, as it had links to 
each of the mobile operators, and was in the business of developing low -cost mobile solutions to 
enable its clients to reach consumers. The company was fo rmed as a result of a merger between 
an aggregator and a platform developer, so it had all the technical skills needed. In the end, Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 13  
however, GSMA entered into a partnership with Wazazi Nipendeni, which had a proven track 
record in delivering SMS content to  mothers.  
The original concept was ambitious, and centred around getting potentially competing 
organisations to collaborate, which is a time -consuming business. Eventually, timescales conspired 
against that concept, and in the first wave of countries, GSM A entered into what might be regarded 
as more conventional partnerships with mobile operators. The partnership in Tanzania with the 
Wazazi Nipendeni product is something of an exception to this rule, as it is hosted by a PPP that, 
although it has agreement s with mobile operators, is independent of any single MNO.  
4.2 History of Wazazi Nipendeni  
Voxiva was founded in 2001 as a disease surveillance system that enabled health workers to 
submit local reports of disease outbreaks using a phone. This was one of the e arliest examples of 
an ICT -based innovation developed to solve a developing world problem. The system enabled 
real-time data collection, data analysis, and dissemination of response information (back to health 
workers in the field). Initially set up in Per u, the Voxiva system was later replicated in Africa. When 
the PEPFAR programme was launched in 2003, it partnered with Voxiva as part of a consortium in 
Rwanda  (Casas and Lajoie, 2005).   
Voxiva then provided a link from early, pioneering work on exploiting  mobile technology in public 
health to the subsequent Phones for Health programme. PEPFAR was keen on working with PPPs  
as a mechanism for achieving its objectives, and it set up seven multi -country PPPs in 2007  
(PEPFAR , 2008), one of which was ‘Phones for Health’. Phones for Health was a PPP between 
Accenture Development Partners, GSM A, Motorola, MTN, and Voxiva . All fund ing initially came 
through  PEPFAR but was administered by CDC.  Other organisations involved in t he PPP incl uded 
the USAID P rivate Sector Engagement Unit and the Organisation for Global AIDS Co -ordination.  
Although the PPP was o riginally intended to be implemented in 10 countries, only Kenya and 
Tanzania  signed up and committed funding.  
In Tanzania, a ctivities w ere transitioned from Voxiva to local organisations  in 2009. T he transition 
was facilitated through CDC , with management oversight from Phones for Health. In 2010 the 
Phones for Health programme  issued a call for interest in creating a local PPP for mHealt h in 
Tanzania . The CDC foundation described Phones for Health as a pilot, and this next step was 
intended to bring services to scale. In 2011 the name of the local PPP then changed from Phones 
for Health to the mHealth Tanzania -PPP. CDC managed the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP from 2009  to 
2015  and then contracted C ardno to manage the mHealth Tanzania -PPP under a five -year 
agreement covering the period 2015 –2020.  
GSMA has played an instrumental role in the development of the mHealth Tanzania -PPP. It was 
one of the original partner s in the Phones for Health partnership (in 2007). GSMA twice nominated 
the programme as one of the five most successful mobile health interventions, and it was selected 
for an award i n 2014 . This was important as the profile helped to secure the support of mobile 
operators for the service. CDC view s the mHealth Tanzania -PPP as a success story, as it is rare to 
see a successful transition from a centrally held programme to a country -held PPP, and especially 
one in which  there is a true partnership with the national ministry of health.

4.3 Partnerships  
The mHealth Tanzania -PPP evolved as a group with expertise in brokering partnerships, which are 
a defining feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service. Partners fall into a range  of categories 
(represented in Figure 2): 
• MoHCDGEC  – Multiple departments within the ministry have convened various initiatives 
supported by Wazazi Nipendeni throughou t its evolution.  TFNC is currently operating as a core 
partner in the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, which provides synergy with the expanded nutrition 
content provided by the mNutrition programme.  Wazazi Nipendeni, as an mHealth service, 
offers a good fit with MoH CDGEC’s  eHealth Strategy, and supports the Government of 
Tanzania’s commitments under the Open Government Partnership.  
• Content providers – Over the course of multiple initiatives, various organisations, mostly NGOs, 
have assisted with  the development of content to augment the Wazazi Nipendeni database; 
this includes a number of MoHCDGEC  departments.  
• Mass media organisations – These have worked with content partners to generate multimedia 
outputs; this was largely funded by JHCCP under the Tanzania Capacity and Communications 
Project.  
• Telecoms partners (Airtel, Tigo, Vodacom, and Zantel) – These provide zero -rated SMS 
messages at the heart of the system. This represents the largest single cost item of the service, 
if valued at market rates for SMS messages.  The four largest MNOs in the country have 
partnered with Wazazi Nipendeni; messages are funded through their corporate social 
responsibility ( CSR ) departments and the Vodafone Foundation.  
• Technology platform – The service was origi nally facilitated by the open source Vusion platform 
provided by TTCM , originally a non -profit .4 However, this system had a number of 
shortcomings, many of which were a consequence of the technical setup.  In October 2016 , the 
system migrated to a new plat form commissioned by MoHCDGEC , funded by CDC, and 
provided by a Tanzanian company, Rasello.  
• Implementing partners – These are operational organisations running health campaigns in 
various parts of the country. The content provided by Wazazi Nipendeni supp orts their 
campaigns. Their field presence enables them to enrol people in the system.

The original Wazazi Nipendeni text messaging service did not have the capability to deal with voice 
messages, but voice messages were developed as part of the local content development process 
in Tanzania. Under a separate agreement, GSMA subsequently commissioned HNI  (now Viamo ) 
to incorporate the mNutrition  content into its 321 service, provided in partnership with Vodacom  
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 16  
Tanzania . In contrast to Wazazi Nipendeni, the 321 service is a ‘pull’ type of service, whereby 
users dial a short code and navigate through interactive menus to find the information they are 
seeking.  The system mostly plays audio clips to users, rather than sending SMS text messages. 30 
interactive voice response ( IVR) scripts were selected to be integrated into the 321 health service, 
and were recorded.  
4.4 Developments in Tanzania  
The revise d Wazazi Nipendeni  service , including the additional nutrition messages incorporated 
under the mNutrition programme , was officially launched by the Minister of Health, Community 
Development, Gender, Elderly and Children  during World Breastfeeding Week in A ugust 2017 .5  
In line with the strategy articulated at the baseline, MoHCDGEC  continue to assume greater 
responsibility for functions previously carried out by the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, especially the 
technical operations. The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP continu es to work closely with MoHCDGEC  staff 
in the field, and estimate s that there are roughly 1 ,700 health workers currently active in promoting 
and registering women onto the system. The Rasello platform is a tool  that is  paid for and used by 
MoHCDGEC . The mH ealth  Tanzania -PPP continue s to be responsible for the technical 
management of the platform. The ICT Unit in MoHCDGEC  have responsibility for a wide range of 
digital tools used in different aspects of health services, not only those that use mobiles to 
disseminate information to clients . MoHCDGEC  programmes that are now using mobile services 
developed by the  mHealth  Tanzania -PPP include  the following : 
• National Aids Control Programme (NACP ) – Fast-track A ntiretroviral (ARV)  Refills S cheme 
(FASTA), PEDAIDS ( Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation ( EGPAF ) programme) . 
• National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programm e – TB self -assessment (PATH and Cardno). The 
mHealth  Tanzania -PPP developed and manage s two T AMBUA TB  apps6 that enable users to 
carry out self-screening and information dissemination. Diagnosed TB patients can be 
registered by health workers to receive treatment adherence messages. The mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP is working to integrate records with the national ele ctronic TB and leprosy 
register sy stem. At the moment , anybody reached by the PATH programme will have to fill in 
personal details, but if they also attend a gov ernment  health facility, they will have to fill in 
another paper form with the same details. Integrating data systems will avoid creating duplicate 
data.  
• TFNC  – The dissemination of nutrition information using mobiles ( Wazazi Nipendeni ) is an 
integral part of the Tanzanian Government’s progress in scaling up nutrition -specific 
interventions  (Scaling up Nutrition , 2018) .  
• Reproductiv e and Child Health Section – Wazazi Nipendeni  disseminates information to 
pregnant women and mothers.  
• Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (e -IDSR) . The development and 
rollout of the mobile reporting tool was led by the MoHCDGEC  Monitoring and Evaluation  Unit. 
The Digital Health Roadmap to 2023 calls for resources to fund a national scale -up from 17 
regions  (MoHCDGEC , 2017) . 
• National Blood Transfusion Text Messaging Service,  led by the National Blood Transfusion 
Services .

6 https://ntlp.go.tz/posts/ntlp -launch -the-tambua -tb-m-health -applications/  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 17  
• National Feedback Mechanism for health services (public feedback on health services 
provided).  The Digital Health Roadmap to 2023 recommends investing in the electronic client 
feedback platform.  
• An early infant diagnosis system  (HIV).  
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP’s relationships with MNOs has  changed. Originally, the mHealth  
Tanzania -PPP signed agreements on behalf of MoHCDGEC  but now MNOs are changing to sign 
agreements directly with MoHCDGEC . For example, Tigo and Halotel have signed new 
agreements to provid e zero-rating of messages with the ministry, rather than with the mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP. Funding from Vodacom is transitioning from the Vodacom Foundation to the 
commercial Vodacom company, which will also be entering into an agreement with the ministry. 
This reflects a growing awareness among MNOs of the value of their support for Wazazi 
Nipendeni , which is important to them given the current political climate (see Section 8.1). This  
shift is consistent with the sustainability plan of the mHealth Tanzania -PPP to transfer 
responsibilities to government agencies.   
Rapid staff turnover within the telecoms industry continues to pose a challenge for the work of  the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP. For example, t here was a change in leadership at Tigo and responsibility 
for Wazazi Nipendeni  was transferred to a completely new team, which changed the CSR priorities 
to education and financial inclusion so that Tigo wanted to discontinue support for Wazazi 
Nipendeni . It is likely that this was linked to changes in the company structure following the 
acquisition by Tigo of a majority stake in Zantel (see Section 8.2). The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, 
with the support of a nutrition officer from MoHCDGEC , had to put a lot of effort into convincing the 
new Tigo team of the value of Wazazi Nipendeni , and eventually secured an ag reement to 
continue their support. Similarly, after time and effort  had been invested  in building relationships 
with the CSR contact at Airtel, that contact then moved on.  
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP continue s to run public awareness campaigns from time to ti me. 
When it runs a particular campaign that is sponsored by a particular MNO it has  to make sure the 
promotional materials only have the sponsoring MNO branding. Some MNOs put a limit on the 
number of messages that they will donate in a year. This will cau se increasing difficulties given the 
current registration growth trend evident in Figure 9. 
Under the arrangement with Rasello, MoHCDGEC  departments and MNOs have been given their 
own dashboards so they can access up -to-date predefined metrics on registrations. However, even 
the dashboard furnished to the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP only gives access to predefined metrics , 
meaning it does not have  direct access to the back -end database. Any request for non-standard 
reports requires a specific request to be made to Rasello to construct a query (there is no 
additional cost for these requests).  
The 2018 PEPFAR country operation plan acknowledges the i mportance of the role that the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP plays in leveraging the support of MNOs. The plan pledges to further 
expand its activities with the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP and emphasises the leadership role of 
government agencies : ‘Expand mHealth PPP and support implementation and expansion of Fast -
Track ARV refills (FASTA) initiatives under NACP and MOH leadership ’ (PEPFAR , 2018) . 
Although the current management contract with Cardno is due to expire in 2020, negotiations 
between the mHealth Tanzania -PPP a nd CDC for a subsequent  phase are already at an advanced 
stage. It is proposed to divide responsibility for the suite of products currently supported by the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP between three main partners:  
• Ministry of Health  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 18  
• Management Development for Hea lth (MDH), a Tanzanian NGO providing research and 
services on public health  
• Management Sciences for Health (MSCH), a public health non -profit working in over 150 
countries,  
This will provide continuity of funding from CDC, as CDC is a major donor to both  of the se 
‘management’ programmes. It is expected that a new management contract will go out to tender, 
possibly for a further 5 years , as is typical for CDC funded programmes.  
Looking to the future, there is a growing recognition of the role of nutrition in HIV programming. 
Good nutrition is important for people who are HIV positive, and good nutrition is required for ARV 
therapies to be successful. Therefore, nutrition is becoming a larger part of ov erall HIV support 
packages. In terms of technology, GSMA and the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP were keen to develop 
the service to include IVR, which  it was thought  would improve reach into poorer communities with 
lower levels of literacy, and would enable users to  actively seek information rather than passively 
receive SMS messages. However, this proved not to be popular when they trialled it and MNO 
partners remain reluctant to zero -rate IVR calls. Nevertheless, they would like to try again with the 
technology. An other idea for providing two -way communication is to work with partners who can 
provide a call centre facility. The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP is considering ways of exploiting the 
reach and power of social media, which is becoming increasingly popular among you ng men and 
women.

5 Review of the business model  
5.1 Introduction  
This section is structured around the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas building blocks . This section 
summarises key observations made in the baseline report , supplemented with additional findings 
from the intervening period, as well as finding s from both the qualitative and quantitative studies. 
An introduction to the canvas and a  more detailed description of Wazazi Nipendeni as it relates to 
the framework are  provided in Annex C . 
5.2 Customer segments  
At registration, use rs are allocated to one of four categories:  
• pregnant women;  
• mothers with newborns;  
• supporters (of pregnant women or young mothers); and  
• general interest . 
The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP covers users registered onto the 
system during a two -year period from November 2016 to November 2018. During this time, many 
women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth, and were then re-
categorised  on the system as mothers with newborns. Figure 3 shows that these women make up 
the vast majority of active users.

• Phone ownership and access are key to a ccessing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service. Having 
at least one household member that owned a phone was part of the screening criteria for 
the quantitative study, so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service 
and phone ownership.  
• In terms  of access, men were reluctant to let their wives have phones, fearing they would 
be used to facilitate affairs, and women themselves recognised that phone ownership can 
cause problems in the family because of trust issues. Among young, married women, who 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 20  
are the primary customer s egment, it tends to be husbands who control their access to 
phones, either through consent to ownership, by buying a handset/ SIM for their wives, or 
by sharing their own phones with their wives.  
• The qualitative study highlighted the importance of enlisting men’s support for (if not 
participation in) the Wazazi Nipendeni  service as a means of facilitating women’s access to 
content. For example, the quantitative study  found that women’s access to Wazazi 
Nipendeni  messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages, as they often 
did not share  them  with their partners. They also found that men often disagreed with some 
content, particularly that on family planning, in which case they would withhold access to 
the messages and would not share information with their partners.  
• As a national service that is available through multiple networks, Wazazi Nipendeni  is 
available all across the country, wherever there is network coverage. It does not, therefore, 
have a particular poverty focus . However, the majority of users were signed up by field 
partners, who tend to focus p rogrammes on rural and low income communities .  
5.3 Value proposition  
The aim of the original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign was to encourage women to avail 
themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health outcomes.  Content had been 
developed over a number of previous partnerships, each of which had a slightly different thematic 
focus , including:  
• prevention of mother -to-child t ransmission of HIV/ Aids; 
• antenatal care ; 
• family planning ; 
• malaria prevention ; 
• nutrition (for mother and baby) ;  
• danger signs ; 
• having an individual birth plan ; and  
• post-partum care.  
The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by contributing substa ntial additional 
nutrition content . Added content cover ed life stages up to five years.  
A key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was the procedures 
put in place to ensure quality of information. TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content 
was accessible and consistent with national nutrition strategies. UX research was conducted early 
on in the project to ensure that messages were appropriate , how they might fit with  different types 
of consumers (the archetypes ), and how to improve the customers ’ experience of the service : 
• GeoPoll  tested a small sub -sample of messages for comprehension and relevance.  
• ThinkPlace  conducted user focused research using human -centred design principles.   
• Frog later conducted further UX research based on in -depth inte rviews . 
Evidence from the quantitativ e study appears to confirm the quality of messages. Value and 
satisfaction metrics among treatment household members were high:  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 21  
• Between 82.7 % and 91.6 % of households read all the mNutrition content they received.  
• Over 90% of users either always or very of ten found the messages useful (see Figure 4). 
Figure 5 shows that information on maternal nutrition was regarded as most useful (but not 
by a large margin).  
• Over 90% of users (93.5% of females and 92.2% of males) would recommend the service 
(likely or highly likely).  
• 89% of females and 81% of males self -reported implementing at least  one tip.

Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their 
behaviours, as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service had improved a range o f 
nutritional outcomes. Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved , as 
follows : 
• Dietary diversity for children aged 6–35 month s – The number of food categories consumed 
increased by 0.107 (p -value 0.073).  
• The likelihood that children  aged  6–35 months met the minimum dietary diversity – Children in 
the treatment communities were 3.8 percentage points more likely to have consumed from four 
food groups (p -value 0.093).  
• Children aged 6–23 months in the treatment communities were 6 .9 percentage points more 
likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet.  
Diets among women of reproductive age (primary females) had also improved:  
• The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women  had 
increased by 4.0 perce ntage points (p -value 0.062).  
Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved:  
• There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices  among men.  
• There was a statistically significant impact on the combined household -level measure of 
nutrition knowledge.

5.4 Channels  
In the 2015 Tanzania DHS  survey  53% respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni.  Note that the 
five year TCCP programme started in 2010 and finished in 2016, so the DHS survey will have been 
conducted when the programme had achieved nearly maximum reach.  Radio was clearly the 
single channel that achieved greatest reach : 87% of people had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni  
from the radio ( Table 1). About a quarter of respondents had heard about the campaign on the 
television , with another quarter  doing so  through printed media ( poster / magazine/ newspaper/ 
billboard).

During the initial campaign  as part of the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project (TCCP) , 
printed materials were distributed to a range of health facilities where women come into contact 
with health professionals , e.g. hospitals, health centres, dispensaries. The mHealth  Tanzan ia-PPP 
worked in partnership with the health sector, providing training for health professionals, who were 
then able to help women register on the system. There are three  ways of registering for the Wazazi 
Nipendeni text messaging service  (analysis can be found in Section 6): 
• Assisted by health facility worker – women can be signed up when they come for antenatal 
care visits etc.  
• Assisted by community health workers – community workers can sign women up when they 
visit them in their homes, or other local venue s.  
• Self-registration – instructions were given in the multimedia campaign.  People dial the short  
code and then are guided through a small number of profiling qu estions (category of user, and 
stage of pregnancy/ age of child).  
• Registration data show that 57% of users were registered by partners. It is not possible to 
determine exactly how many of the ‘other’ users actually registered by themselves, but 59% 
were re gistered using USSD, suggesting that they were in fact registered, or at least assisted 
by a health worker . This means that up to  83% of users were registered by partners. Although 
mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nip endeni

than 100%.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 24  
campaign, it is face-to-face contact through partners that is instrumental in signing people up . 
TFNC also believes that people who register with a health professional will have a positive bias 
to comply with messaging, have a better understanding o f how the service works, and be more 
likely to appreciate how they can benefit from the service.  
Figure 6 confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health 
matters (government more so than NGO facilities). It is interesting to note that even among control 
communities, people have high levels of trust in information from  automated text messages, 
confirming that text messages are regarded as being reliable and of high quality. Patterns of who 
people actually get information from ( Figure 7) broadly reflect levels of trust, although they 
emphasise the importance of government health workers.

The qualitative research identified a number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with 
women’s lifestyles:  
• text messages can be read repeatedly – audio messages may be heard incorrectly ; 
• as messages remain on the phon e, they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any 
time; and  
• text messages are private – they remain on the phone, which tends to be regarded as a 
personal device; audio messages can be overheard by others.  
It should be noted that the SMS channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context, 
given that literacy levels are relatively high (for sub -Saharan Africa)9, and the country is united by 
the language of Swahili.  
5.5 Customer relationships  
The aims of the customer r elationship s that Wazazi Nipendeni  creates with users can be 
considered to be threefold:  
• Acquisition. Those who were assisted with registration have quite a different relationship with 
the service to those who self -registered. Registration data confirm the importance  of field 
partners; up to 8 3% of users were signed up by partners (see Section  5.4).  
• Retention. Several features of the system minimise pain points that might  promp t users to 
leave a system. The service is free of charge . The system only requires a user’s pregnancy or 
maternal status to be gathered at registration . Content is regarded as relevant and of value. 
Retention levels are high; registration data indicate tha t the number of people opting out of the 
service is equivalent to roughly 7% of new users in a month . 
 
9 The adult literacy rate in Tanzania is 78%, compared to an average for sub -Saharan Africa of 64% (2015 data from 
https://data.worldbank.org ). 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 26  
• Compliance  with improved health practices . High levels of satisfaction and perceived quality 
support high retention levels. Nearly 90% of those who self -reported having ever received the 
content  read all messages received, and over 80% self -reported implementing at least one tip.  
Wazazi Nipendeni has a strong brand, which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the 
service, and users tend to view it  as a MoHCDGEC  service , as the Government pushed it through 
the media .  
Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania -PPP comes from CDC, it can be argued 
that the most important relationship is that with CDC. Providing evidence that the service is 
delivering improved health outcomes is important.   
5.6 Revenue streams and indirect b enefits  
Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge t o users, so there is no direct revenue stream. The service has 
also been made available free of charge to field partner institutions. In 2016 the mHealth Tanzania -
PPP and TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be 
permitte d to charge for these information services.  In the end, the Government insisted that health 
information should be made available to citizens free of charge , which constrained opportunities for 
developing commercially sustainable business models. This is a national policy issue.  
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP is currently funded by CDC, although the successful functioning of the 
service depends on contributions by various partner organisations. The service is, therefore, 
vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding fr om CDC . Current funding is planned to 2020. The service 
also depends on the zero -rating of text messages by partner MNOs.   
There is no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni has resulted in lower churn. The quantitative study 
found no difference in the length of t ime that respondents reported having had their main SIM card, 
there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone number as they had 
at baseline (a two -year duration), and there was no difference in the proportion who subscribed to 
the same operator as a t baseline.  
ARPU was higher among users. Control households spent an average of  TZS 5,300 per month 
(£1.90/month) on mobile phone airtime (including any data bundles), but spending was 10% higher 
(TZS 510, £0.18/month) in treatment  communities. The qualitative study found this was due to 
women becoming more confident in using their phones . 
The latest DHS data indicate that 53% of people (across the country) had heard of Wazazi 
Nipendeni  (see Table 6 ). TCRA  data for October 201810 give the total number of subscribers on 
the four partner networks  as 41.0 million. Therefore, 550,000 Wazazi Nipe ndeni  users  represent 
1.3% of the entire subscriber base. Although MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not use  the 
reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni  in their promotional materials, they are beginning to 
recognise the political value attached to their support for Wazazi Nipendeni . By signing 
agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni  directly with the Government rather than with the 
mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution.

5.7 Key resources  
Key resources are d efined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition . The 
primary assets employed by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP in delivering the text messaging service 
are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages . 
The current content  comprises the pre -existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, 
and additional content generated through the mNutrition programme. This nutrition content is 
regarded as a public good, having been paid for by FCDO . In March 20 19, CABI made this content 
publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource .11  
The text messaging service originally ran on the Vusion  platform  developed by TTCM in 
partnership with the Praekelt foundation. In October 2016 Waza zi Nipendeni migrated to a new 
platform, created for MoHCDGEC  by a loc al software developer (Rasello).  The new platform is 
able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track the number of users and 
messages being sent.  
The text messaging service i s designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign s, so the  field 
partner  programmes and  interventions are a key resource required to deliver the full potential of 
the value proposition. To date, 2 4 partners have assisted with registering users in the fiel d (see 
Section 5.9).  
The key ‘resource’ in convening these partn erships has been, and will continue to be, the 
partnership with TFNC and its linkages to  both nation al nutrition policymakers  and health and 
nutrition interventions launching in the country . 
Early in 2019, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP appointed a new team leader. While the previous 
country manag er came from a mobile technology background, the new team leader  is a medical 
professional. This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP, as Government agencies take 
greater ownership of the platform along with associated technical responsibilities.  
5.8 Key activities  
In order to make the business model work, perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be 
undertaken is networking. Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania -PPP clearly have good personal 
contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs, and to enlist the support of MNOs.  
The Global Content Partnership was mandated to create higher -level, generic content, and little 
provision was made for creating specific, locally relevant messages . Under the original vision, it 
was expected that participating organisations would tailor global content to their own needs. When 
this idea was abandoned, additional funding was made available for Every1Mobile and 
COUNSENUTH to localise content.  
TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content 
generat ion process. However, TFNC adopted a much more proactive role, and its involvement has 
continued to deepen throughout the project. When the content generation process was changed to 
facilitate the production of more detailed, localised content, TFNC got mo re involved. TFNC’s 
engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that 
signing -off procedures went smoothly.  
 
11 https://ckan.cabi.org/data/dataset/nutrition -knowledge -bank  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 28  
Monitoring and evaluation is a key activity , as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni  
makes tow ards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with 
forthcoming health interventions.  
Providing a face -to-face presence when work ing with women is important for achieving positive 
behaviour change. The qualitative study foun d that messages acted as reminders to reinforce 
information provided by health workers, and to reinforce mothers’ existing knowledge.  
Registration, scheduling, and  the dispatch of messages to users  is handled by the technical 
platform . This is sub -contrac ted to Rasello, as the platform provider, and management is being 
gradually transferred from the mHealth Tanzania -PPP to MoHCDGEC . 
Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant , e.g. new drugs and products will be 
introduced, and recommende d practice will be modified. People will quickly lose trust in information 
that is not immediately useful, or , even worse, wrong. One of the partners needs to be given the 
responsibility (and funding) for ongoing maintenance of content.  
5.9 Key partnerships  
The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and TFNC is a defining 
feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service. Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the 
resources needed to make the service succeed:  
• Research and design. Wazaz i Nipendeni was o riginally conceived as a prevention of malaria in 
pregnancy campaign,  following an analysis by JHCCP  of the 2010 Tanzania DHS data. The 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put 
together by JHCCP  and MOHSW.  
• Content. Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by 
MOHSW , to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and 
delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action .12 Content on family 
planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproducti ve Health (m4RH) .13 Content for 
Prevention of Mother -to-Child  Transmission  was designed by EGPAF. TFNC was instrumental 
in securing the support of the SBCC  TWG  for nutrition in approving content.  
• Technology platform. The service was originally run on the V usion open source platform 
developed by TTCM. The system architecture led to problems with reliability, latency, and cost. 
The service was migrated to a new platform in October 2016. It was hosted locally by Rasello 
and was commissioned and paid for by  MoH CDGEC  (with CDC funding).   
• Telecoms operators. The mHealth Tanzania -PPP had identified MNOs as key partners at the 
start. However, MNOs  needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing.  
The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched wit hout explicit support from MNOs , but after 
the service achieved 100,000 users  within 11 weeks  the MNOs entered into agreements . 
• Field partners. The programme launched in November 2012 with a two-month nationwide 
media campaign (radio and TV). A follow -up campaign ran from July 2013 to February 2014 , 
during which field partners promoted the service and assisted with registrations. In addition to 
the 24 field partners (see  Table 9 ) that have formal agreements with the mHea lth Tanzania -

Foundation, the mHealth Alliance, and BabyCenter.

e-Pact 29  
PPP (and have a source c ode allocated on the system), other agencies have simply 
incorporated registering women onto Wazazi Nipendeni  into their field processes. Analysis of 
registration data suggests that field partners may have assisted up to 83% of users to register.  
• Governmen t agencies. The Government of Tanzania is committed to a number of relevant 
health policies on nutrition, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal mortality, and to a 
number of information and ICT policies , including open and accountable government, and 
electronic access to health services.  
5.10 Costs and investment  
The baseline report presented set -up and ongoing costs covering a two -year period, mainly 
derived from costs reported by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and GSMA. Now that more detail has 
been provided, these costs have been superseded by a more comprehensive and rigorous 
analysis , which is  presented in Section  7. 
In ad dition to those costs directly associated with the mHealth Tanzania -PPP (both operating and 
capital), FCDO  and GSMA have invested in wider programmatic costs that stimulated and 
supported this action.  It is worth noting that the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP has a history of donations  
and in -kind contributions made over the years by the CDC and programme partners . 
5.11 The business m odel 
It is proposed that Wazazi Nipendeni  is based on a multi -sided platform business model, which is 
commonly associated with IT businesses . This provides a means of making a product free to one 
group of customers, while another group pays.  Wazazi Nipendeni brings together two groups, 
providing a link between funders, who pay for the service, and users who receive the service for 
free (see Figure 8). Funders with a health mandate benefit from improved health outcomes 
achieved by users.  Field -level partners cannot really be considered a third side to the platform 
because they already have their own link to users through their field presence. The relationship 
with Wazazi Nipendeni can be considered as a simple business -to-business transactional 
arrangement as described – Wazazi Nipendeni provides a valuable service, and partners drive 
users to the system . 
Figure 8:  Key partnerships (business model)  
 
 
Sources: Authors  
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 30  
The s trengths and weakness of the business model can be summarised as  follows : 
• Partnerships are a key feature of the mHealth Tanzania -PPP’s way of working , and have been 
instrumental in securing resources that have made the service a success. The PPP core team 
have continued to forge new alliances with f ield partners as they implement new health 
interventions. Links with the G overnment of Tanzania have been strengthened over the 
duration of the evaluation study as MoHCDGEC  has assumed greater responsibility for the 
technical platform in particular.  
• The v iability of the model is vulnerable to discontinuity in revenue, i.e. it depends on CDC 
funding. On the one hand , five -year fixed -term agreements provide security, but on the other 
hand , the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP is facing uncertainty now the agreement is shortly to expire. 
Nutrition content may not be a continuing priority for CDC, which focuses  on HIV , tuberculosis , 
and malaria in Tanzania .14 Now that it has been shown that the VAS generates substantial 
incre ases in ARPU, it may be possible to argue a case for some kind of revenue sharing 
agreement with MNOs; further research is required to explore viable mechanisms for this.  
• The reach and brand of the service is attractive to field partners. DHS data showed that over 
half of adults were aware of Wazazi Nipendeni  (in 2015), and the quantitative study found that 
13% of people in the control sample had received messages from Wazazi Nipendeni .  
• Wazazi Nipendeni  offers a strong value proposition. Not only are qual ity metric s for the 
messages high (e.g. levels of trust, frequency of reading messages, customer satisfaction 
ratings), but users also report changing their behaviour, so the service is valued by users. The 
quantitative study has shown that the service is linked to improved nutritional outcomes 
(notably an increase in dietary diversity among infants), demonstrating value to partner health 
agencies , such as TFNC , and to donors , such as CDC. Indirect benefits in terms of increased 
ARPU provide a strong commer cial basis to justify the in -kind contribution made by MNOs to 
the service.

6 Analysis of users  
6.1 Overview  
The mHealth Tanzania -PPP submitted Wazazi Nipendeni  registration data from the Rasello 
platform  to the authors . The query was performed on 27 March 2 019. A ‘working’ dataset cover ing 
a two -year period (11 November 2016 to 3 November 2018 ) addresses a number of data issues:  
• Creating an additional category that represents women who registered when pregnant but have 
since given birth and have continued us ing the service as a mother with a child.  
• Spikes in registrations . On 10 November 2016, the date when A PI registrations were adopted  
by multiple partners, and a spike in USSD registrations over a three week period in November 
2018.  
• Anomalies with opt -out dates, e.g. over 9,000 records were marked as having opted out on 3 
April 2017.  
The analysis in this section is supported by more de tail given in  Annex D . 
6.2 Growth in user numbers  
Both n ew registrations and opt -outs fluctuate monthly . In the period May 2017 – October 2018 new 
registrations were runn ing at an average of around 20,000/month, whereas people were leaving 
the service at a much lower rate of less than 1,400/month , i.e. 7% of new users. Combining new 
users with people leaving the service gives the cumulative profile of active users presente d in 
Figure 9. 
Figure 9:  Growth in active users  
 
Source: Authors  
In the absence of reliable data , it is not possible to track patterns of growth in users from the 
introduction of the service. The total number of users may be up to 1 30,000 higher than  suggested 
by Figure 9, because many of the o riginal users that were migrated onto the new system have not 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 32  
been included in these numbers. Nevertheless, the patterns of growth and opt -outs remain 
accurate . 
In November 2017, t he mHealth  Tanzania -PPP estimated the number of active users to be 
350,000. This is consistent with the active user numbers in Figure 9, as a dding 130,000 to the 
November 2017 estimate of 200,000 from the chart gives a total of 330,000 , which i s close to the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP estimate . Making an assumption of straight -line growth in active user 
numbers , and assuming a starting base of 100,000 active users (rounded down), the number of 
active users after a two -year period (December 2016 to Nov ember 2018) is estimated at 550,000.  
This figure was validated by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP.  
6.3 Understanding users  and partners  
The majority of users (75%) were signed up as pregnant women (sum of ‘PW’ and ‘PW=>MC’ 
categories in Figure 3). 12% were general information -seekers, and 3% were supporters of one 
type or another.  
The NHIF has brought the largest number of users onto the system ( Figure 10). Among the 11 
partners that registered more than 1,000 users, all apart from UNICEF used either API or USSD 
exclusively (almost). None used t he short  code . When the USSD system was introduced, SMS 
remained the channel the general public could use to register . Among users registered with no 
partner, 62% registered using an API or USSD  (Table 2) suggesting that many could well have 
been registered with the assistance of a field partner. It is not, therefore, possible to determine 
precisely how many users truly self -registered , i.e. without any a ssistance. Up to 83% of all users 
could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of partner if API and USSD 
registrations are included.  
Figure 10:  Registrations by partner  
 
Source: Authors  
 
Registration data provide some insights into the ways in which different programmes work. For 
example, the rate of registrations by NHIF  was roughly constant , whereas self-registrations 
fluctuate widely as people respond to local and national campaigns.  050000100000150000200000250000Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 33  
There is a peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three -month mark, which coincides with 
the first trimester of pregnancy. Users who were supporting pregnant women a lso tended to sign 
up at the end of the first trimester . Users who registered as mothers (and supporters of mothers) 
mostly signed up within the first month after giving birth.  
Most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women and left before  giving birth. The 
relatively low number of women in the ‘PW=>MC’ category leaving suggests that women who used 
the system throughout their pregnancy liked it, and then continued to use it in motherhood. The 
sub-set of data that represents users who have r egistered and then left the service is relatively 
small (n = 25,300) . 
TFNC hypothesised that women who were assisted with registration might have a stronger 
commitment to the service, stay on the service for longer, be more likely to read the messages, 
and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours. Table 2 sheds some light on the users leaving 
the service. While 12% of those registered by partners using  USSD subsequently dropped out, 
only 0.3% of API registrations opted out. Only the general public continued to register using the 
short  code, so only 38% of those with no partner can be classified as self -registered with some 
confidence. 42% of these users  opted out, which provides some evidence to support the TFNC 
hypothesis.

7 Financial viability of business models  
7.1 Overview of business models  
In the baselin e report ( Batchelor  et al., 2018), it was proposed that the relationships between key 
stakeholders could be regarded as a multi -sided platform business model. This provides a means 
of making a product free to one g roup of customers, while another group pays. When considering 
financial viability, the principal cost components are  as follows : 
Operating costs:  
• mHealth Tanzania -PPP (offices, staff, servers) ; 
• Government agencies (staff costs) ; 
• SMS and USSD costs (MNOs) ; and 
• field partner agencies (staff costs and expenses).  
Fixed costs:  
• developing content (Global Content Partnership and localising of content) ; 
• mNutrition programme support (e.g. GSMA business intelligence) ; and  
• developing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service (mHealth Tanzania -PPP).  
It is difficult to argue a case for the financial viability of the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP because none 
of the partners generate revenue directly from providing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service. Indeed, all 
parties are prohibited from generating direct revenue because the Government of Tanzania has 
ruled that all health services should be free to consumers. However, the quantitative research has 
found that the ARPU increased among users, so it is possible to develop a business case  for 
MNOs to provide an mHealth  service on the basis of indirect benefits  (these are discussed in 
Section 5.6). If there is a commercial case for MNOs to provide an m Health service, then there is a 
case for a third party to provide content on a revenue share basis (as with conventional VAS).  
Under the current business model, MNOs made no investment in developing the Wazazi 
Nipendeni  service, but they have donated the S MS messages and USSD sessions that the service 
depends on. Without any investment, standard financial metrics such as IRR or payback period are 
not relevant. In this case the contribution margin15 gives an indication of financial performance, or 
the contri bution that the product makes to group profit.  
This analysis goes on to consider the financial viability of two scenarios:  
• An independent but commercial content provider: The provider invests in localising content 
(assuming nutrition and maternal health c ontent is in the public domain) and manages both the 
technical systems and arrangements with national health programmes (in the same way as the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP). It provides information services as a VAS to MNOs on a revenue 
sharing basis.  
• An in -hous e MNO service: The MNO invests in localising content (assuming nutrition and 
maternal health content is in the public domain) and sets up an internal product development

divided by the per unit revenue.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

group to manage technical systems and to make alliances with national health programme s (in 
the same way as the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP).  
A financial model has been created to explore each of these options, based on cost data submitted 
by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, Cardno, CABI, and GSMA.  
7.2 The financial m odel 
The model is based on operating cos t structure and cost data provided by Cardno, supplemented 
by data gathered through interviews. These cost data include a quantification of in -kind 
contributions made by MNOs (donating SMS and USSD sessions) and partner NGOs (mainly 
time).  
Key to the mode l is an estimated profile of user numbers, which is the basis of calculating 
revenues (from indirect benefits) and variable costs. The profile of active users in Figure 9 
suggests numbers are continuing to rise, given roughly constant rates of new subscriptions, and 
relatively low rates of opt -outs. This is likely to be the case for at least five years, at which time 
early users will start to leave the system as their chi ldren reach five years of age.  It is estimated 
that there were over 100,000 active users on the system at the beginning of the period for which 
reliable data  are available, which were  used to calculate the trends in Figure 9 (described in 
Section 6.2). The financial analysis is based on a four -year period, during which the number of 
active users can be expected to continue to rise , as illustrated in Figure 11.16

customer numbers profile, as well as fixed costs. Details of cost components and estimates are 
presented in  Annex E .  
Cash flow ( operating profit) = revenue – cost of sales – fixed costs  
 
16 Given the concerns over the quality of the early data, the number of active users as at November 2016 has been 
rounded down from 130,000 to 100,000.

Revenue:  
• Indirect benefits – increase in ARPU . 
Cost of sales : 
• Cost of SMS – nominal value to MNO of text messages sent to  customers (disaggregated by 
MNO).  
• Cost of USSD sessions . 
Fixed costs : 
• Administration expenses (mHealth  Tanzania -PPP) – project management, staff costs, platform, 
travel.  
• Government institutions – in-kind staff costs . 
• NGO partners – in-kind staff costs . 
• Product development – content curation.  
The analysis considers the viability of the service from various perspectives , including the MNOs 
under the current arrangements, but also possible commercial scenarios. Therefore, it considers 
investment costs incurre d in developing the product for roll -out in a specific country. The following 
investment costs have been included in the model ( see Annex E ): 
• global content developme nt; 
• localisation of content – e.g. developing appropriate messages, seeking necessary approvals ; 
and 
• support service provided by the mNutrition programme – formative evaluation, UX consultants.  
Note that no direct grant payments were made to the mHealth Tanzania -PPP under the mNutrition 
programme.  
7.3 Public good m odel 
Under the current arrangement, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP is funded by public money (from 
international donors), and the service is enabled by the charitable donation of SMS messages by 
the MNOs. Given the government’s position that the service cannot be charged for, and the 
increasing role of the MoHCDGEC in the delivery of the service, it is not likely that any shift 
towards a more commercial business model will take place in the foreseeable futu re.  
The c osts of developing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service have been covered by CDC, as part of  its 
public health programmes. The c osts of developing the additional nutrition content have been 
covered by the mNutrition programme. The service is funded and r egarded as providing a public 
good, which it undeniably is. However, the quantitative study has shown that the MNOs are 
reaping tangible, if indirect, financial benefit from the service. This section considers the value of 
this benefit to partner MNOs unde r the current arrangement.  
Financial reporting by the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP quantifies the financial contribution made to 
Wazazi Nipendeni  by each of the supporting MNOs. It does this by estimating the number of SMS 
messages donated by each MNO and then mu ltiplying  that by the consumer retail price of SMS 
messages. In the absence of any payment to Wazazi Nipendeni  for the content, the cost of Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 37  
messages is the only variable cost, but it varies between MNOs according to the different SMS 
retail prices.  
The quantitative research found that ARPU was TZS  510 higher among people who used Wazazi 
Nipendeni  (compared with those who did not use the servi ce). Given an ARPU of TZS 5,300 per 
month ( £1.90 /month) among the control sample, this indicates that the VAS stimulates a 10% 
increase in ARPU. This is supported by the finding from the qualitative research that women 
became more comfortable and confiden t in using their phone when they received messages from 
Wazazi Nipendeni , implying that they then used their phone more, using more airtime.  
Given the user growth profile in Figure 11, the contribution margin flattens out at 2 4% (see Figure 
12). The cost of SMS messages is directly proportional to the number of active users. However, 
the cost of USSD sessions relates to the number of new users, which is assumed to be constant 
despite monthly  fluctuations.  At high user numbers, this cost component becomes a much smaller 
proportion of variable costs, dropping from 9% of variable costs in  Year 1 quarter 1 to 1% of 
variable costs in Year 4 quarter 4. This explains why the contribution margin is lower at lower user 
numbers.  
Note that the variable costs in Figure 12 are based on the aggregated costs across all four MNOs, 
each of which has been allocated different charge rates for SMS messages according to their retail 
prices  (at baseline) . Table 3 shows the sensitivity of contribution margin to SMS price  (at high user 
numbers) .

The price attributed to sending SMS messages is clearly highly influential in determining how 
attractive their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni  appears to operators. So w hat is the cost to an 
operator of sending an SMS? In a study on the impact of consumer  consumption of network 
services (voice, SMS, and data) on network profitability, Blackburn et al., (2013) highlight a trend 
towards flat-rate pricing (as opposed to pay as you go). They point out  that one feature that makes 
this attractive to operators is  that the cost of delivery is a small fraction of the retail price. Keshav 
(2009) concluded that the cost of sending an SMS message was likely to be less than 
$0.003/SMS, or 2% of the per unit price charged to pay as you go customers (in the USA). Lack of 
clarity on the true cost of sending SMS message s continues to plague development cost 
modelling. For example, in a study of an mHealth intervention in Tanzania, Mangaone et al., (2016) 
modelled scenarios using standard SMS charge rates ( $0.03/SMS) , along w ith reduced rates 
($0.02/SMS and $0.01/SMS) , representing negotiated bulk purchasing agreements.   
The analysis up to this point has been based on the retail prices given in Table 3, which can be 
interpreted as representing an opportunity cost to the MNO. However, given that MNO s are 
sending out messages to thousands of users , it could be argued that a bulk SMS price would be 
more realistic . A price of TZS 25/SMS, for example, would give a contribution margin of 70%. If, on 
the other hand, there is no real cost to the MNO of sending SMS messages, then the contribution 
margin tends towards 100%.  
The contribution margin is a measure of how much a product contrib utes to fixed costs and thereby 
to profit (once fixed costs are covered). However, it takes no account of any investment made in 
developing a product, so it cannot be used as a predictive measure of the likely financial viability of 
developing a product; IRR is widely used for this purpose.  
The model indicates that over a four -year period, mobile operators donate texts and USSD 
sessions totalling a nominal value of £3.9 million. However, over the same time period, the indirect 
benefit of ARPU sums to a total of £5.1 million, which represents a real financial gain.  
The other indirect benefit often credited to VAS is a reduction in churn ( Tricarico , 2016 ). However, 
the quantitative research did not find any evidence that people using the Wazazi Nipendeni  service 
had owned their SIMs for longer. Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because 
consumers are not ‘tied in’ to contracts; the Tanzanian market is predomi nantly prepaid so high 
churn rates might be expected. However, in rural or underserved markets where signal coverage is 
poor, consumers often find themselves effectively tied in to a single operator by virtue of being able 
to access only one network in the ir geographical location. Therefore, churn tends to be lower in 
rural areas. The quantitative study was carried out in Iringa, which is a largely rural district, so it is 
not surprising to find low rates of churn, making it difficult to measure any differe nces in churn.

7.4 Commercial content p rovider  
The previous section highlighted the financial benefits to MNOs of offering the Wazazi Nipendeni  
service. This opens up possibilities for the content provider to generate revenue through some kind 
of revenue share  agreement with MNOs, which in turn opens up possibilities for spinning off the 
content provider as a commercially viable venture. This section considers the financial viability of 
such a venture as a hypothetical case , based on cost data from the mHealth Tanzania -PPP. It is 
intended to represent the opportunity for replicating an mHealth agency delivering a service similar 
to Wazazi Nipendeni  in another country.  
The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs:  
• Nutrition content deve loped under the GSMA mNutrition programme is publicly available and 
open source, so the ‘raw’ content can be accessed and adapted at no cost.  
• There is a real cost associated with localising content. This includes framing the content in 
messages that are r elevant and readily understandable by users , as well as translating  content  
into local languages. In the case of Wazazi Nipendeni , messages are all in written format for 
disseminating as SMS messages, which avoids the considerable expense of making voice 
recordings that are needed for outbound dialling and other voice -based systems. Securing 
government approval of messages is a major cost. Health services tend to be highly regulated, 
and the experience of Wazazi Nipendeni  is that the health ministry was diligent in ensuring that 
messages were consistent with Government of Tanzania health policies. A good deal of time 
was spent negotiating the balance between making messages factually accurate yet at the 
same time informal and easy to understand.  
• An agency w ould need to invest in product development , as was the case with Wazazi 
Nipendeni , which benefited from UX research and formative evaluation throughout the duration 
of the mNutrition programme (both of which were funded through the GSMA mNutrition 
programm e).  
These costs sum to an investment of £312,500 (see  Annex E ). 
The following assumptions have been applied regarding operating costs:  
• the fixed operating costs associated with running the mHealth Tanzania -PPP will not change ; 
• the content will need to be  continually reviewed and revised in order to keep it consistent with 
development s in government health policy and practice ; and  
• the agency would need to bulk purchase SMS messages from each client operator. A price of 
TZS 25/SMS has been assumed .19  
It is assumed that the hypothetical agency would start from scratch, with no pre -existing users, so 
the model is based on the profile of active users presented in Figure 9. 
Note that no account has been taken of the in -kind contributions made by government agencies 
and partner NGOs, both of whom are critical to the success of a service. It can be argued that any 
government has a vested interest in setting up a service that has  a material benefit for health 
outcomes, and so should forego any potential claims on the cost of the time they invest in 
mediating on behalf of the service provider. Similarly, it can be argued that the cost of the time 
 
19 https://sendsms.co.tz/pricing/  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 40  
invested by partner NGOs, including  marketing and registering users, is outweighed by the benefits 
that the service adds to their field programmes.  
At 100% revenue share with MNOs (i.e. all  TZS 510/user/month in increased ARPU goes to the 
content provider), Figure 13 suggests the service would break even at the beginning of year 3 . 
However , the rate of return on investment over a four -year time horizon would be negative. Given 
the assumed trajectory of g rowth in user numbers, much greater revenues are generated if the 
timescales can be extended. Therefore, at 100% revenue share, the service could generate a 
positive IRR of 4% over a six-year period. However, rate of return is highly sensitive to revenue 
share: at 90% revenue share (i.e. the MNO retains only 10% of the increase in ARPU), the IRR 
turns negative.  
Figure 13:  Profits – commercial content provider

Projecting the user growth profile in Figure 9 over a further two years would result in a total of 1.3 
million active users. The population of Tanzania is 54.2 million  (National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS) 
2019)  and the average household size is 4.9  (MoHCDGEC , 2016) , so the number of households 
across the country is around 11.1 million. 16.2% of the population is under five years of age  (NBS, 
2013) , equating to 8.8 million  children under five. If households with children under five had an 
average of two children both aged under five, then the total number of households with at least one 
child under five would be 4.4 million (40% of all households). This rough calculation su ggests that 
a user target of 1. 2 million Wazazi Nipendeni  users may be ambitious but is not impossible.  
As revenue is generated solely from increases in ARPU, the financial viability of such a VAS is 
highly sensitive to that increase. Up to this point, th e analysis has been based on the TZS 
510/month increase in ARPU found by the quantitative study (on a baseline level of ARPU of TZS 
5,300 among the control sample). This is based on the effect of the random offer of access to the 
service in the quantitative study (i.e. comparing ARPU between the treatment and control 
samples). The study found that 66% of the treatment sample and 27% of  the control sample 
reported having received nutrition messages by SMS (in the last two years). The study points out 
that this method of calculation was likely to underestimate effects, but the authors were unable to 
calculate more specific effects with an y reliability because of inconsistencies in the self -reported 
access to the Wazazi Nipendeni  messages. They concluded that this was because respondents 
may not have been able to correctly identify the source of nutrition text messages received.  
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 41  
Figure 14 shows how sensitive  the financial viability of a service is to this effect size, and  it shows  
that if the effect size was 15%, then a service could be financially attractive over a four-year period. 
Based on the proportions of both samples that reported receiving nutrition message by SMS, the 
effect size could be double (20%), in which case the return on investment would be highly 
attractive.

The large number of active users means that financial indicators are highly sensitive to changes in 
ARPU. The ARPU found among the control sample was TZS 5,300, which is consistent with 
published data. Vodacom Tanzania quotes ARPU figures of just over TZS 6,000 (for  the year 
ended March 2019  (Vodacom , 2019) ), and Airtel has publish ed consolidated data covering five 
East African countries  (Airtel Africa , 2019) , quoting an ARPU of $2.4 (December 2018 , TZS 
5,500 ).20 The quantitative study was conducted in Iringa, a rural district, so measured ARPU levels 
would be expected to be below that national average. Figure 15 shows that , if all other 
assumpt ions are held constant, a service would need to reach a user base with an ARPU over TZS 
7,000/month in order to generate a positive IRR over a four-year period . This is unlikely , given that 
these reports , as well as industry analysis  (BMI Research , 2016) , confirm a current trend of 
declining ARPU. This figure is based on generating revenue from a 10% increase in ARPU.

The breakdown of operating costs over a four -year period show s how the fixed costs associated 
with running the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and running the technology platform are dominant ( Figure 
16). Analysis shows that cent ral expenses would need to be reduced by 40% (from the levels 
estimated in Annex E ) in order to produce a positive IRR of 4% over a four-year time period (at 
100% re venue share). Again, even at 90% revenue share the IRR turns negative.

Consider a scenario in which an independent mHealth VAS provider can develop and deliver an 
information dissemination service under the following assumptions:  
• a 20% reduction in fixed operating costs (staff time and platform costs) ; 
• a nationwide ARPU of TZS 6,000  /month ; 
• a 15% increase in ARPU when consumers use the mHealth VAS ; 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 43  
• a 50% revenue share with MNOs ; and  
• an SMS price of TZS 25. 
These positive assumptions indicate that such as service could generate a positive IRR of 6% but 
only over a six-year period.  
7.5 In-house MNO service  
The quantitative study has shown that consumers using Wazazi Nipendeni  spend more money on 
airtime, estimated to be equivalent to a 10% increase in ARPU. This raises the possibility that an 
MNO could justify creating an mHealth VAS on the basis of this increased revenue. This section 
considers a hypothetical business case scenario in which an MNO in another country sets up an 
mHealth service in -house. The key differences from the commercial content provider scenario 
considered above is that the MNO would retain all of the additional revenue generated, and there 
would be no real costs associated with the SMS messages sent.  
The model is based on the following assumptions regarding capital costs:  
• Nutrition content developed under the GSMA mNutrition pro gramme is publicly available and 
open source, so the ‘raw’ content can be accessed and adapted at no cost.  
• There is a real cost associated with localising content. This includes framing the content in 
messages that are relevant and readily understandable by users , as well as translating  content  
into local languages and securing government approval of messages.  
• The MNO would need to invest in product development , as was the case with Wazazi 
Nipendeni , which benefited from UX research and formative evaluation throughout the duration 
of the mNutrition programme.  
These costs sum to an investment of £312,500 (see  Annex E ). 
The following assumptions have been applied regarding operating costs:  
• The fixed operating costs associated with running the mHealth VAS in -house would be the 
same as for Wazazi Nipendeni . 
• The content will need to be continually rev iewed and revised in order to keep it consistent with 
development s in government health policy and practice.  
• The MNO would be able assign the real cost of sending SMS messages and USSD sessions 
(both have been zero -rated in the analysis).  
• No account has been taken of the in -kind contributions made by government agencies and 
partner NGOs, both of whom would be critical to the success of  such  a service.  
It is assumed that the hypothetical MNO -based service  would start from scratch, with no pre -
existing users, so the model is based on the profile of active users presented in Figure 9. 
If SMS messages and USSD sessions are  zero-rated then the service would break even in year 3, 
although it would not generate enough cash to provide a positive return on investment over a four-
year period. Assuming the same trajectory of increasing users’  numbers in Figure 11, the large 
number of users (rising to 1.1 million) would generate enough revenue to provide a 19% IRR in a 
five-year period.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 44  
As revenue is generated solely from increases in ARPU, the f inancial viability of such a VAS is 
highly sensitive to that increase. Up to this point, the analysis has been  based on a TZS 510/month 
increase in ARPU found by the quantitative study (on a baseline level of ARPU of TZS 5,300 
among the control sample) , i.e. an effect size of approximately 10% . As described above, this is 
likely to be an underestimate and the real effect size could be double ( a 20% increase in ARPU).  
Figure 17 shows how sensitive  the financial viability of a service is to this effect size, and that even 
if the effect size was marginally higher than 10%, then a service could be financially viable in a 
four-year period. Based on the proportions of both sampl es that reported receiving nutrition 
message s by SMS, the effect size could be double (20%), in which case the return on investment 
would be highly attractive.

The large number of active users means that financial indicators are highly sensitive to changes in 
ARPU. The ARPU found among the control sample was TZS 5,300, which is consistent with 
published data  as described above. Figure 18 shows  that a service could generate a positive IRR 
over a four-year period if offered to a user base with an ARPU of around  TZS 6,000, which 
appears to correspond more or less to  the Tanzanian market average. The study was conducted in 
Iringa, a rural district, so measured ARPU levels would be expected to be below that national 
average.  This figure is based on generating revenue from a 10% increase in ARPU.

Consider a scenario in which an in -house mHealth VAS can be developed and delivered under the 
following assumptions:  
• a 20% reduction in fixed operating costs (staff time and platf orm costs ); an MNO would be 
quite capable of setting up their own platform, which could reduce real costs still further ; 
• a nationwide ARPU of TZS 6,000  /month ; and  
• a 15% increase in ARPU when consumers use the mHealth VAS.  
These positive assumptions indicate that such a service would be financially attractive, providing 
an IRR of approximately 70% over a four-year period.  
There are non -financial constraints that an MNO would face if implementing an in -house mHealth 
VAS as d escribed in this section. These relate to relations with government and NGO partners. In 
the case of Wazazi Nipendeni , TFNC was instrumental in securing approval of the messages. Any 
government body would need to be seen to be scrupulous in its dealings wi th a private sector 
organisation, and would be keen to avoid accusations of partisanship. While a government agency 
might be keen to support an enterprise that is clearly for the public good, it may be more measured 
in its support for a private sector vent ure. This depends on the country context; in countries with 
strong policies on ICT and private sector growth, government agencies may be keen to support 
this kind of venture.

8 Changes in the mobile ecosystem  
8.1 The political  economy  
The telecommunications market in Tanzania has been subject to continued political influence over 
the duration of the evaluation study. T he Electronics and Postal Communications Act was 
introduced in 2010  and required telecommunications companies to offer at least 25% of their 
shares to the public by floating on the Dar es Salam stock exchange , and to do so within  three 
years  (The Electronics and Postal Communications Act , 2010) . This move was resisted by 
operators and the provision was not enforced at first. However, when a new president was elected 
(at the end of 2015), the bill was amended in 2016 , giving  companies  a further three years to make 
shares available. Vodacom was the first of the operators to comply, listing on the stock exchange 
in August 2017 .21 At the beginning of 2019, Vodacom was still the only company to have 
complied .22  
Tigo in Tanzania is the trading name of MIC Tanzania plc .23 However, ownership of shares in MIC 
Tanzania has been in dispute. Two companies owned by a single businessman ( Golden Globe 
International Services Ltd and Quality Group Ltd .) alleged that they bought shares in 2014 entitling 
them to a 99% stake in MIC Tan zania, although the complex dispute traces its roots back to 
2002 .24 Only in July 2018 did the courts rule that MIC Tanzania was the legal owner of Tigo 
Tanzania .24 Up until that point, the dispute had meant that Tigo was not been able to make 
provision for any public offering of shares.  
Any plans for Airtel to comply with the share offer obligation have also been delayed by a dispute 
over ownership . Celtel acquired a stake in the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited 
(TTCL, the incumbent operator) in 2001, and the Government remained the majority owner. The 
successful mobile operator, branded Celtel , was subsequently set up as an independent mob ile 
operator, wholly owned by TTCL. In 2005, the two were legally separated but Celtel retained a 
35% stake in TTCL while TTCL was left with a 40% holding in Celtel .25 Around the same time 
(2005), Celtel was purchased by Zain . Zain was then purchased by Bh arti Airtel in 2010, and has 
since been trading as Airtel. In 2017, the Government made a claim on the ownership of Airtel, 
alleging irregularities in the original privatisation process. This argument is not without merit, as 
one of the problems characteri sing privatisation  processes at this time was a lack of data  (Christen 
et al., 2005) . The matter has only recently been resolved by Bharti agreeing to make a number of 
ongoing payments to the Government , and giving the Government further shares to bring its 
shareholding up from 40% to 49%, leaving Bharti still in control .26  
Another indicat ion of the extent of renewed political  interest in the telecommunications  sector was 
the replacement of the head of the telecoms regulator by the new president , on the grounds that

sectors  to address tax evasion. In 2018, the CEOs of Halotel and Zantel were cha rged with fraud .28 
More recently , in 2019, f ollowing the arrest of its CEO, Vodacom Tanzania pleaded guilty to the 
charge of intending to avoid paying taxes .29 In April 2019 it made a $2.3 million payment to the 
Government .  
8.2 Developments in the market  
Acco rding to the latest figures published by the regulator, the total number of mobile subscriptions 
has risen from to 40 million in March 2017 to 4 4 million in December 2018.  The population has also 
increased, from 53.0 million in 2016 to 58.0 million in 201930 (representing a growth rate of 3.0% 
per year). T he mobile market continues to mature, as the penetration rate increased from 78% in 
2017 to 81% in 2018  (TCRA , 2019a) . TCRA figures show erratic but continued growth : 
• January 2015 to January 2016 – 22.4% (numbers increased by 7.3 million) . 
• January 2016 to January 2017  – 0.3% (numbers increased by 0.1 million) . 
• January 2017 to January 2018  – 0.4% (numbers increased by 0.2 million) .  
• January 2018 to January 2019  – 9.7% (numbers increased by 3.9 million).  
Mergers have also changed the dynamics of the market. At the time of the baseline study, Zantel 
was one of the MNOs that had signed up to support Wazazi Nipendeni . However, Tigo had bought 
85% of shares in Zantel i n 2015 ,31 leaving the remaining 15% owned by the Government of 
Zanzibar. Zantel continue d to trade under its own brand until recently . At the beginning of 2019, 
Tigo (owned by Millicom) initiated proceedings to acquire this remaining 15% by seeking regulat ory 
approval .32  
Vodacom continues to have the largest market share, and has increased this share from 31.7% 
(March 2017) to 32.4% (December 2018) – see Figure 19. The market share of the combined Tigo/ 
Zantel group rose to 29.4% ( December  2018), substantially narrowing the gap between the second 
player and the market leader.

It is estimated that 45 % of the population of Tanzania is under the age of 15 .33 If they are 
considered to be economically inactive and highly unlikely to own a mobile phone , then the data 
more accurately repr esent s a penetration rate of 147%, meaning that many adults own more than 
one SIM. This tends to reflect a mature market, but also hides uncompetitive market conditions, 
notabl y restricted network coverage in certain areas and off -net tariff premiums (i.e. it costs more 
to call someone on a different network).  
Mobile internet subs cribers have also grown over the period , from 17.3 million in 201 5 to 23.1 
million in 2018  (Figure 20, TCRA , 2019b) . Expressed as a share of mobile subscribers, interne t 
use has increased from 43% of wireless  subscribers  (both mobile and fixed) in 2015 to 52% in 
2018 .

There is an appetite among mobile operators to increase access to the internet and data use. For 
example, in June 2018 TCRA issued broadband licences to Vodacom Tanzania and Azam 
Telecom , with an obligation to achieve population coverage of 60% by 2021, in creasing to 90% by 
2025 .34 
8.3 Trends in mHealth Innovations  
8.3.1  Technology and mobile business models  
The majority of mobile internet connections are 2G, and Tanzania’s broadband coverage lags 
behind its neighbours (see Figure 21). GSMA predict s that mobile data consumption across sub -
Saharan Africa will multiply sevenfold by 2024 (from 1.1 to 8.5 GB/subscriber/month)  (GSMA, 
2019), and this is likely to be driven by 3G technology.  Multiple features are driving data usage  
(see Annex F  for further detail) : 
• Over the top (OTT) services continues to grow. In 2017, 20% of adults in Tanzania used social 
networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter  (Pew Research Cen ter 2018) . Use has grown 
by one -third over the three years from 2014 to 2017.   
• Increased revenue from data services can more than make up for any decline in voice revenue 
from OTT services  (Esselaar and Stork , 2018).  
• Entertainment services . TVs are becomi ng more widespread and the affluent are spending 
more time watching TV and video on mobile devices.  
• Smartphone sales are on the rise . Smartphone ownership stood  at around 13% of adults in 
2017, well below the median for sub -Saharan Africa (33%)  (Pew Resear ch Center, 2018) . 
GSMA estimate s that  the number of handsets will more than double from 2018 to 2025.  
All this suggests that mobile data use is set to grow.

Perhaps the most transformational technology that has blossomed since the baseline report is 
mobile money. In 2017, 60% of the population had a mobile money account  (Okeleke , 2019) , and 
TCRA figures show a 40% increase in accounts over a three -year period from 2016 to 2019. M-
Pesa (Vodacom) is the market leader in Tanzania , at 40%  market share , and Tigo Pesa is second , 
at 32%.  Okeleke (2019) estimates that the value of transactions processed through mobile  money 
services in 2017 was $22 billion, equivalent to almost half of the country’s GDP.  
8.4 mHealth innovations  
The Health Data Collaborative35 has done some interesting work on classifying digital health 
interventions, led by the Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group. It propose s that tools 
can be divided into the following high -level categorie s36: 
• interventions for clients (e.g. client c ommunication, health tracking, information services, 
financial transactions);  
• interventions for healthcare providers (e.g. client registration, health records, decision support, 
telemedicine, information management, medication management);  
• interventions fo r resource/ health system managers  (e.g. human resources, supply chains, civil 
registrations, health financing, asset and facility management); and  
• interventions for data services  (e.g. data collection, coding, mapping, and exchange).

Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 51  
Wazazi Nipendeni  assists pregnant women and mothers by providing them with information on 
how to look after themselves and their infant, so it falls into the broad category of client -facing 
tools. Within this category, the Health Data Collaborative give examples of services t hat fall into a 
range of sub -categories (see  Annex G ): 
• Targeted client communication ; 
• Untargeted client communication ; 
• Client to client communication ; 
• Personal healt h tracking ; 
• On-demand information services provided to clients ; 
• Client financial transactions . 
 
The classification makes a clear distinction between services providing unidirectional information 
dissemination to clients (targeted and untargeted) and client -initiated services (peer group, citizen 
reporting , and health information -seeking). Wazazi Nipendeni  is an example of the first of these 
and is a ‘push’ service. The Viamo 3 -2-1 service offered by Vodacom, on the other hand, is an 
example of a clien t-initiated service and is a ‘pull’ service, as it relies on the user to dial a short  
code to access information. In principle, a service could combine both aspects of communication 
as each has its advantages and drawbacks.  
It is interesting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile 
phones. This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions, as they tend to use a 
platform that manages payments between healthcare providers, but the interaction with th e client is 
done by SMS. This reliance on SMS tells us two things . Firstly , SMS is a good enough means of 
communicating with clients (i.e. constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not 
rendered the services unfeasible). Secondly, SMS is regarded as the most cost -effective medium 
for communicating with clients. This is closely linked to the first point, as voice -based services 
(such as outbound dialling and call centres) can overcome literacy and language constraints, but 
come at a much h igher cost.  
The classification was drafted in 2017, so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist. 
Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet , and smartphones in particular, 
of data acquisition and analysis, and of mobi le money services  (some examples are given in  
Annex G ). Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

9 Discussion  
9.1 Role of gov ernment  
The case of Wazazi Nipendeni  underlines the importance of working in partnership  with 
government agencies. The role of M oHCDGEC and a range of departments within the ministry is 
evident in a variety of ways, for example:  
• long-term commitment to the concept of using mobile  phone s to disseminate information to 
clients, starting with the PEPFAR Phones for Health programme in 2007;  
• TFNC involvement in designing locally relevant and accessible messages;  
• TFNC and its contacts was instrumental in securing approval for the content;  
• gove rnment health workers played an active role in promoting the service and assisting women 
with registering;  
• the G overnment was influential in brokering partnerships with field NGO health programmes;  
• MoHCDGEC  commissioned and paid for the new platform;  
• makin g agreements with MoHCDGEC  to support Wazazi Nipendeni  has been of value to 
MNOs in the political economy of the industry;  
• the G overnment is regarded as a trusted provider of information, so MoHCDGEC  branding of 
messages has been important in building the Wazazi Nipendeni  brand, which is important in a 
market plagued by spam.  
9.2 Theory of change  
Steps in the draft theory of change drawn up by GSMA ( Figure 22) have been revie wed in the light 
of the findings from the study  (see Table 4). Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

Step  Description  Rating  Comment  
1 Users subscribe 
to the service  
 The number of active users has been estimated at 550,000 as at the end 
of 2018. The cumulative number of people reached will be higher still. 
Users registered on the Wazazi Nipendeni  service for free – they did not 
pay any subscription fee. No insights are  available into willingness to pay 
for this kind of information dissemination service. Willingness to pay is 
likely to be low, given that users already have access to much of the 
information through health systems (messages acted as reminders to 
reinforce information provided by health workers, and to reinforce 
mothers’ existing knowledge).  
2 Users use 
service to 
access 
information   Among  respondents who received message s, over 80% read the 
mNutrition conten t. Only 66% of households in the treatment group had 
received messages . 
3 Users use 
service on a 
repeat ed basis   Of users who could identify messages as from Wazazi Nipendeni , only 
19% received messages last month. Most did not know why, but 18% had 
lost SIM/  handset.  
4 Users acquire 
new knowledge 
about nutritional 
practices   mNutrition increased knowledge of IYCF and nutrition for males , and 
increased the combined household -level measure of nutrition knowledge . 
5 Users adopt 
improved 
nutritional 
practices   Over 80% self -reported implementing at least one tip. The study 
assessed IYCF practices and dietary diversity. Wazazi Nipendeni resulted 
in improved children’s dietary diversity scores, the likelihood that children 
satisfied the minimum dietary diversity t hreshold, and the likelihood that 
they achieved a minimum acceptable diet. Women were more likely to 
meet the minimum dietary diversity threshold  (despite no evidence of 
changes in household -level food consumption patterns).  
6 Nutrition service 
impact  
 Wazazi Nipendeni  had no impact on child nutrition as measured by 
anthropometry. The Wazazi Nipendeni  service improved a range of 
nutritional outco mes, most notably multiple indicators associated with 
diets among young children . 
7 Direct revenue  
 TFNC stipulated that the Wazazi Nipendeni  service was to be provided 
free of charge to users.  
8 Indirect 
commercial 
value   The Wazazi Nipendeni service increased ARPU by at least 10%, likely to 
be higher. Wazazi Nipendeni  did not reduce churn (churn tends to be low 
and difficult to reduce in underserved rural areas).  
9 >= running 
costs  
 The theory of change implies that running costs are incurred by the same 
entity that receives revenue. This is not the case with Wazazi Nipendeni , 
where MNOs receive increased revenue but the mHeal th Tanzania -PPP 
incurs costs. At an SMS price of TZS 25, revenue would exceed co sts at 
over 250,000 users.  
10 Commercial 
viability  
 The theory of change implies  that a service would be viable if revenue 
exceeds running costs, but this takes no account of return on investment. 
Wazazi Nipendeni  can trace its roots back through donor -funded 
programmes to 2001. A scenario for setting up a hypothetical in -house 
MNO service indicates it could provide a positive IRR over four years , but 
this has not been proven . Setting up a hypothetical independent content 
provider (like the mHealth Tanza nia-PPP) would be less attractive, 
providing a positive return over six years.   
11 Crowding in of 
the mHealth 
sector  
 Having demonstrated the viability of the PPP, and the reach of mobile 
services, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP has entered into agreements wit h 
other field partners (for Wazazi Nipendeni ), and has developed additional 
mobile services. It is too early to say whether this has increased demand 
(and funding) for mobile services, and  it is too early to expect the private 
sector to move into the marke t.

 Insufficient information  
Source:  Authors’ own  
The Theory of Change in Figure 22 reflects an emphasis on commercial sustainability  that is 
consistent with the original Business Case ,37, which  refers to the value of demonstrating 
sustainable business models in reducing risk  for commercial investors. The  role of donor funded 
business models in the mHealth sector at the time was well recognised; the i nitial GSMA scoping 
study presented three services, all of which were classified as having ‘donor funded’ business 
models  (GSMA 2014) .  
The original mNutrition documentation emphasised the role of private sector investment in taking 
mobile services to scale. However, t he experience of Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also 
possible for donor funded mHealth services to reach scale. In fact, Wazazi Nipendeni reached 
substantially more users than any of the other mHealth projects supported through the mNutrition 
programme (GSMA 2018). Although negotiations have yet to be concluded, evidence to date 
suggests that the donor funded busine ss model can be effective in attracting further investment, 
albeit from donors rather than the private sector.  
Although not explicit in Figure 22, one of the features o f the mNutrition programme is the potential 
for mobile services to achieve positive outcomes ( “Nutrition service impact ” in Figure 22) among 
poor and disadvantaged groups. It has been pointed out that Wazazi Nipendeni is offered as a 
national service available through multiple networks  and does not, therefore, have a particular 
poverty focus . There are, however, implications for the ext reme poor arising from the different 
business models considered. Two hypothetical models are considered in Section 7 – a third party 
content provider and an in -house  MNO driven model. An independent content provider would 
typically enter into agreements with organisations providing health services on the ground (a B2B 
model), whereas an MNO would offer a service directly to their customers (B2C model). Wazazi 
Nipenden i is an interesting hybrid, as the service is made available to MNO customers and at the 
same time the mHealth Tanzania -PPP has entered into agreements  with agencies implementing 
health programmes on the ground.  
Cost of sales is a key factor in any MNO dri ven model and must be balanced with any increase 
indirect benefits, especially if the service is to be freely available as in Tanzania. Literacy clearly 
presents a barrier to accessing SMS based services. Voice -based services (such as outbound 
dialling and  call centres) can overcome literacy and language constraints but  are prohibitively 
expensive.  
Third party models have the flexibility to buy bulk SMSs from multiple MNOs. The partnership 
agreements that the mHealth Tanzania -PPP has forged with MNOs are a  key feature of the 
service, meaning that it is accessible to customers on all of the major networks. This increases 
reach among the extreme poor who tend to live in underserved areas where signal coverage is 
poor and consumers have no choice of operator a s they can access only one network in their 
geographical location.  The agreements they have made with implementing agencies also 
increases reach among the extreme poor as field partners’ programmes tend to focus on 
vulnerable communities in rural areas.

Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 56  
An mhealth service provider will tend to have a focus on the health sector, whereas MNOs have a 
focus on upselling to maximise revenue from a customer segment.  The lower spending power of 
the extreme poor makes it difficult for an MNO to justify investing i n developing services targeted at 
this group. Emerging d ata based services will be instrumental in overcoming literacy barriers  (e.g. 
using audio and video ) but not in the foreseeable future , while data rich services emerging (e.g. 
integrating financial se rvices) will exclude the extreme poor who do not have the digital literacy  
skills needed.  
9.3 MNOs  
The merged entity of Tigo and Zantel has a market share close to that of the market leader, 
Vodacom (se e Figure 19). This threat to Vodacom’s dominant position is likely to result in 
increased competition. As operators look for innovations and opportunities to attract and keep 
customers, they may well prioritise exploring commercial opportunities to capitalise on thei r support 
for Wazazi Nipendeni . Not only Wazazi Nipendeni , but the operators will also be keeping an eye on 
competing and alternative mobile health solutions to spot opportunities . The mHealth Tanzania -
PPP and TFNC will need to liaise closely with supporti ng MNOs to ensure that they continue to be 
satisfied that Wazazi Nipendeni  provides commercial benefits, and to engage in ways such that the 
service can be adapted to meet the changing priorities of MNOs.  
9.4 Possible m echanisms for revenue generation  
Despite  the best efforts of GSMA to prompt innovative thinking on ways of generating revenue, the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP model remains essentially unchanged, save for greater involvement of 
MoHCDGEC . The model may be forced to change if donor funding through CDC is  not renewed 
when the current agreement expires in 2020. Stakeholders commonly mentioned the idea to 
charge field partners. Firstly, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP could charge for providing messages to 
clients registered by the partner ; and, secondly, the mHeal th Tanzania -PPP could charge for the 
time and effort spent developing new, bespoke content for the partner (on a consultancy basis). 
The trouble is that the first of these is a symbiotic relationship – the mHealth Tanzania -PPP 
provides messages while the f ield partner assists women to register in the field, so could partners 
then charge the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP for each user registered?  
Another possibility being pursued is getting private sector partners to sponsor messages as a 
means of advertising. TFNC h as pointed out that it has  guidelines on the types of goods that it 
would permit to be associated with Government -endorsed health messaging, e.g. food products 
would not be permitted.  
The mHealth Tanzania -PPP has also looked at bringing on insurance partn ers, which is an 
interesting idea given the advent of new mHealth services using smartphone apps that use mobile 
money functionality. This opens up possibilities not only for sponsorship, but also for incorporating 
innovative payment features into the heal th messaging service (e.g. discounts on insurance 
premiums for Wazazi Nipendeni  users).  
9.5 Trends in mHealth services  
Although mobile subscriber numbers continue to grow, growth in internet subscribers is much 
greater . The majority of mobile internet connect ions are 2G, and Tanzania’s broadband coverage 
lags behind its neighbours. S martphone ownership stood  at around 13% of adults in 2017, well Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 57  
below the median for sub -Saharan Africa (33%) . This all suggests that m obile data use is set to 
grow  and t here is indeed an appetite among mobile operators to increase access to the internet 
and data use.  Further investment may be forthcoming now that disputes involving the major MNOs 
have been resolved.  
The mobile money industry has grown rapidly in Tanzania , and 60% of the population had an 
account in 2017. Recent mHealth services are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet, and 
smartphones in particular, of data acquisition and analysis, and of mobile money services. 
Integrating mobile money mean s that services can offer users the ability to pay subscriptions, 
make purchases, and access financial services such as credit and insurance. For example, Tigo 
partnered with a micro -insurance compan y, Milvik Tanzania,  to offer the BimaMkononi  mobile 
insur ance service .38 Customers can buy hospital insurance, accident insurance , and life insurance. 
Premiums can be paid using Tigo Pesa or by cash at a Tigo customer service centre. The service 
takes advantage of the mobile money platform, and provides an incen tive for users to join the 
mobile money service.  
9.6 Financial viability and scenarios  
The commercial content provider scenario  discussed  in Section 7.4 is based on the mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP model but generating revenue through a revenue share agreement with MNOs 
(albeit indirect revenue). One of the dilemmas facing VAS developers, especially t hose operating in 
the public goods space, is whether to enter into an agreement with a single MNO, or to make their 
offering available across all networks. Using multiple networks potentially increases the reach of a 
VAS, but it instantly eliminates one of  the indirect benefits of VAS – reduced churn. There is no 
incentive for a consumer to stick with a given operator if a service they like and want to use can 
also be accessed on other networks. For this reason, MNOs are generally only interested in 
enterin g into exclusive agreements. This means that the commercial content provider scenario 
considered  in Section 7.4 may be difficult to broker in practice.  
The alternati ve of an in -house MNO -based service may, therefore, be a more realistic option. The 
financial modelling also suggests it is easier to make a financial case for this model given that all of 
the increase in revenue would be retained by the MNO and the real cost to an operator of sending 
SMS messages is minimal. This is also closer to the majority of projects supported by the 
mNutrit ion programme , which were led by MNOs, although in most cases the MNO entered into a 
partnership with a VAS content provider (Viamo was the VAS provide r in four projects) , rather than 
setting up expertise in house (see GSMA , 2018). One of the potential drawbacks of this private 
sector -led approach is that a government may have reservations about lending its branding to a 
corporate product . 
The scenarios proposed above have been prompted by the increase in ARPU demonstrated by the 
quantitative study. Reduced churn is a further indirect benefit commonly associated with VAS when 
provided by an MNO, yet the quantitative study found no evidence of reduced chur n among 
Wazazi Nipendeni  users. Prepaid markets tend to have high churn rates because consumers are 
not ‘tied in’ to contracts , and the Tanzanian market is predominantly prepaid. However, in rural or 
underserved markets , where signal coverage is poor, cons umers often find themselves effectively 
tied in to a single operator by virtue of being able to access only one network in their geographical 
location. Therefore, churn tends to be lower in rural areas.

9.7 Looking back  
Looking back on the development of the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP and the Wazazi Nipendeni  
service, it is interesting to see how the strategy articulated at the baseline has largely come about, 
with more partners entering into agreements with the mHealth Tanzania -PPP to provide mobile -
based services,  and with the Government getting more involved and assuming more responsibility 
for the platform. As part of this evolution, the primary role of the mHealth Tanzania -PPP appears to 
have shifted from technical to health. The PPP was originally set up to dev elop the software and 
systems needed to deliver a service, but an understanding of public health now seems to be more 
important in dealing with MoHCDGEC  and negotiating partnerships with health partners. It is also 
interesting to note that the current mode l closely resembles the original concept for the ‘one -stop 
shop ’ articulated by GSMA at the beginning of the mNutrition programme. The mHealth Tanzania -
PPP is the ‘go to’ institution in Tanzania that can help programmes entering the country to set up 
mobil e services more conveniently, at a lower cost, and avoiding duplication, rather than setting up 
independent services themselves. The difference is that although the mHealth Tanzania -PPP 
moderates a complex partnership of public and private institutions, it  itself is effectively a public 
body. It is funded by public money through CDC and  it has no desire to become a for -profit 
organisation. The original GSMA vision was for a private body to act as the aggregator, or at least 
as a form of cooperative that wou ld generate revenue to cover costs.  
9.8 Looking to the future  
The mHealth Tanzania -PPP and Wazazi Nipendeni  are now approaching a c rucial point in time . 
Firstly, the agreement providing funding for the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP is due to expire shortly, 
and it is not yet clear whether CDC will continue to fund the PPP beyond this date. Secondly, 
advances in technology are leading to a next generation of mHealth services that are smartphone -
based and delivered over the internet. Increasing broadband coverage and fal ling smartphone 
prices mean that these services will be accessible to more of the population in the next few years. 
Many new services incorporate financial services, which can enable subscriptions, purchases (e.g.  
of pharmaceuticals), and insurance. These emerging services are attractive to MNOs as MNO -led 
mobile money services are a source of increasing revenue. These services tend to be accessible 
only to people with higher levels of digital literacy,  so they carry a risk of opening up a further digital 
divide between better educated users and poorer users. Thirdly, recent changes in the structure of 
the telecommunications market may lead to increased competition and investment. Disputes over 
the ownership of both Tigo and Airtel have been resolved. These disputes prevented these 
companies from complying with the regulator’s requirement to float shares on the local stock 
market, so they will also have impeded any plans for investment in the network or  services . Tigo’s 
takeover of Zantel has increased its market share so that it is closer to the leader, Vodacom, and 
this may result in increased competition between two close contenders for market leader.

10 Conclusions  
10.1 The product  
The Wazazi Nipendeni  service offers a s trong value proposition  to users. In te rms of the value 
attributed to the service by users, over 80% of households read all the mNutrition content they 
received, and over 90% of users either always or very often found the messages useful. Users also 
expressed high levels of satisfaction with th e service, as over 90% of users would recommend the 
service (likely or highly likely to recommend it to others ). There is evidence that users translated 
information from  the messages int o action. Over 80% self -reported implementing at least one tip , 
most commonly on  complementary feeding . Evidence of behaviour change was confirmed by the 
quantitative study , which found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni  service had improved a range 
of nutritional outcome s, most notably multiple indicators associated with d iets among young 
children . 
The success of the early nationwide awareness campaigns was still evident in the high levels of 
awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni  (53%) found by the DHS surveys conducted in early 2016. Most 
respondents to the DHS su rvey had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni  through the radio (87%). The 
quantitative study found that 13% of respondents from the control sample had received messages 
from Wazazi Nipendeni . Awareness levels among the public as a whole would be much higher, 
sugg esting that awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni  remains high. Initial users were encouraged 
through media campaigns to self -register but , more recently, users have been assisted with 
registration by partners and health workers. The relatively limited data on opt -outs from the service 
indicate that users who self -registered were much more likely to opt  out (42% , compared with 0.3% 
of users registered by a partner using the API). This confirms the value of face -to-face contact in 
the registration process, and appea rs to confirm the hypothesis that adherence is likely to be 
higher among users who have been assisted with registration.  
SMS remains an appropriate channel for delivering information to women. Notwithstanding 
limitations associated with literacy and local  languages, the service was highly valued by users and 
messages were commonly read. Having said that, it is noted that SMS may be particularly well 
suited to the Tanzanian context, given that literacy levels are relatively high (for sub -Saharan 
Africa), an d the country is united by the language of Swahili.  
It is important to target men with awareness raising so that they are more likely to permit partners 
to access phones. However, it is less important to enrol men on the system as women’s access to 
Wazazi Nipendeni  messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages, as men often 
did not share the phone with their partners. Men would also not share information with their 
partners if they disagreed with the content, e.g. information on family planni ng. Men were 
registered on the system as supporters (among others), and made up only a small proportion of 
Wazazi Nipendeni users (less than 1%).  
Telecoms markets across Africa are shifting from voice to data, as broadband coverage increases 
and data accou nts for a greater share of operator revenues. Smartphones are becoming more 
common as handset prices continue to fall , and social media , such as Facebook, WhatsApp , and 
Twitter , are becoming popular among the young. Although SMS currently remains the most 
appropriate channel for reaching the majority of the population at present, users tastes are 
changing, and the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP will need to adopt the most effective channel for 
reaching the next generation of users.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

10.2 Partnerships  
The Wazazi Nipendeni  service (and the mHealth Tanzania -PPP) can trace its roots back to one of 
the earliest ICT for development pilot projects (Voxiva). This illustrates the importance of a long 
history of investment , partnerships,  and political commitment in nurturing a facil ity to the point 
where it can successfully implement an information dissemination service (and other services ) at 
national scale. This does not necessarily mean that a start -up could not achieve something similar 
but brokering  the complexity and diversity of the partnerships involved is not a trivial achievement.  
The ability to broker a complex set of partnerships has been crucial in the success of the Wazazi 
Nipendeni  service. Partnerships have been forged with a diverse range of stakeholder groups , 
including Government ministries, multiple programme funders (e.g. CDC, JHCCP), content 
providers (e.g. GAIN, field partners), technology providers, and partner MNOs. These partnerships 
have been successful due, at least partly, to the personal skills of t he mHealth  Tanzania -PPP 
team.  
10.3 Business model s 
MNOs have an opportunity to capitalise on the positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni  by using it in 
promotional materials. To date, it appears that operators’ promotion of Wazazi Nipendeni  has been 
weak : Airtel re leased a press statement following the publication of the GS MA case study that 
acknowledged the contribution of MNOs; Tigo mention s Wazazi Nipendeni  as part of its CSR 
activities under the Tanzania page of its website; and Vodacom Tanzania Foundation has a  web 
page that describes Wazazi Nipendeni . There are additional possibilities for further engagement 
with Wazazi Nipendeni , such as training freelancers on registering users, and increasing or 
abolishing any caps on the number of messages sent. Further eng agement can be justified based 
on the increases in ARPU found in the quantitative study.  
The quantitative study has shown that the Wazazi Nipendeni  service yields substantial indirect 
benefits to mobile operators in terms of increased ARPU. The effect size in the quantitative study 
area was at least a 10% increase in ARPU  (TZS 510/month) , and is likely to be higher still  
nationally . This is as a resu lt of women becoming more confident in their use of phones. They 
make and receive more calls and SMS messages. This represents a real financial benefit to MNOs 
as a result of their contribution to Wazazi Nipendeni . As the real cost to an operator of sendin g 
SMS messages is low (tending to zero), there is no cost of sale associated with this increase in 
revenue.  The study found no evidence that Wazazi Nipendeni  users held on to their SIM cards for 
longer (reduced churn). This may be at least in part due to t he rural nature of the Iringa district, 
given that churn tends to be lower in rural areas, making it difficult to achieve any differences in 
churn.  
Demonstrating that Wazazi Nipendeni  generates real revenue for operators opens up possibilities 
for alternat ive commercial business models. Analysis has focused on two hypothetical cases 
representing opportunities for replicating an mHealth agency delivering a service similar to Wazazi 
Nipendeni  in another country. An in -house mHealth service developed by an MNO  appears to be 
the most attractive proposition for two key reasons. Firstly, all of the increase in revenue is retained 
by the MNO and , secondly, the real cost to an operator of sending SMS messages is minimal. 
Based on an initial investment of £312,500 to cover the cost of product development (UX research, 
monitoring and evaluation, content localisation), a scenario based on positive assumptions on 
operating costs, ARPU , and the effect size (increase in ARPU) indicates that a service could 
provide an IRR o f approximately 70% over a four-year period.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 61  
Less attractive, although possibly still viable, is an independent content provider model, similar to 
GSMA’s original vision. In this case, the same investment costs have been assumed but the 
provider would nee d to pay a bulk SMS price for all messages sent ( TZS 25/SMS), and it would 
need to enter into some kind of revenue share agreement with each participating operator. A 
scenario based on positive assumptions on operating costs, ARPU , the effect size (increase in 
ARPU), and revenue share (50%) , indicates that a service could only provide a positive IRR over a 
six-year period.  
The business model continues to be a multi -sided platform business model that provides value to 
funders with a health mandate ( MoHCDGEC  and CDC) who pay for the service, thereby enabling 
users to access it free of charge. One of the principal funders was MoHCDGEC , but as it assume s 
responsibility for more of the activities conducted by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, inc luding the 
Wazazi Nipendeni  service, the business model will tend towards a hybrid of a government -to-
citizen  model  and the multi -sided platform, as the field partners will still support both Wazazi 
Nipendeni  and users, and the MNOs will still provide in -kind funding for messages. Although the 
original vision for mNutrition articulated the role of private sector investment in taking mobile 
services to scale, Wazazi Nipendeni shows that it is also possible for a donor funded business 
model to reach scale and  to attract further investment, albeit from donors rather than the private 
sector.  
10.4 Telecoms industry  
Rapid staff turnover within the MNOs  continues to pose a challenge for the work of  the mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP.  When support was given as part of CSR activit ies, it depended on personal 
relationships, so effort was constantly required to establish relationships with new staff. As support 
for Wazazi Nipendeni  becomes integrated as part of commercial operations, which is increasingly 
the case given developments in the political economy of the telecoms industry, the importance of 
personal relationships may diminish.  
Telecommunications companies have come under increasing pressure from the Government as it 
continues to exert pressure as part of its anti -corruption  campaign. Companies have been required 
to make shares available to the Tanzanian public, and several mobile companies have been 
charged with a range of charges, including Vodacom, which was convicted of tax evasion. Support 
for Wazazi Nipendeni  has politi cal capital in this context, and operators have now signed 
agreements directly with MoHCDGEC  rather than indirectly with the mHealth Tanzania -PPP.  
The principal vulnerabilities of the current business model are funding from CDC, and the free SMS 
messages provided by MNOs. Through not yet secure, policy documents propose further funding 
for the services provided by the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP (e.g. the 2018 PEPFAR country operation 
plan says it will expand the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, acknowledging its ability to leverage support 
from the MNOs; scaling up the Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response  system is 
part of the 2023 Digital Health Investment road map).  The mHealth Tanzania -PPP continues to 
enter into agreem ents with new public health programmes (e.g. PATH). Both the mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP and GSMA have petitioned partner MNOs to analyse user records to demonstrate 
indirect benefits (increased ARPU and reduced churn), but unsuccessfully to date. The quantitativ e 
study provides robust evidence of a substantial increase in ARPU (but no reduction in churn). It is 
hoped that this will be of value to the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP as it negotiate s continued and 
increased support from MNOs in the future.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

PO 6420: External evaluation of mobile phone technology based  nutrition and 
agriculture advisory services in Africa and South Asia  
 
Introduction  
 
DFID (Research and Evidence Division) wishes to commission an external impact evaluation of 
mNutrition, a mobile phone technology based nutrition and agricultural advisory  service for Africa 
and South Asia. mNutrition is a programme supported by DFID that, through business and science 
partnerships, aims to build sustainable business models for the delivery of mobile phone 
technology based advisory services that are effectiv e in improving nutrition and agricultural 
outcomes.  
mNutrition is primarily designed to use mobile phone based  technologies to increase the access of 
rural communities to nutrition and agriculture related information. The initiative aims to improve 
knowledge among rural farming communities especially women and support beneficial behaviour 
change as well as increas ing demand for nutrition and agriculture extension services. The 
mNutrition initiative launched in September 2013 will work in 10 countries in Africa (Cote d’Ivoire, 
Ghana, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia) and four 
coun tries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka). The desired impact of 
mNutrition will be improved nutrition, food security and livelihoods of the poor.  
Mobile phone based services have been endorsed by WHO as an effective strategy for beha viour 
change and for driving adherence to anti -retroviral treatment protocols (Horvath, Azman, Kennedy 
and Rutherford 2012). There is currently scant evidence on the impact and cost -effectiveness of 
mobile phone technology based services for nutrition and agriculture and on the sustainability of 
different business models for their provision. A rigorous evaluation of mobile phone technology 
based nutrition services would add significantly to the current evidence base. An external 
evaluation team managed by the Evaluator , independent of the programme delivery mechanism, 
will conduct an assessment of the impact, cost -effectiveness and sustainability of mobile phone 
technology based information and behaviour change messages for nutrition and agriculture.  
Backgro und to mNutrition  
 
Introduction  
Undernutrition is a major challenge to human and economic development globally. It is estimated 
that almost one billion people face hunger and are unable to get enough food to meet their dietary 
needs. Agriculture is a major source of livelihood in many poor countries and the sector has a 
potentially critical role in enhancing health, specifically maternal and child health and nutritional 
status. A well -developed agriculture sector will deliver increased  and diversified farm outputs 
(crops, livestock, non -food products) and this may enhance food and nutrition security directly 
through increased access to and consumption of diverse food, or indirectly through greater profits 
to farmers and national wealth.  Better nutrition and health of farmers fosters their agricultural and 
economic productivity. Current agricultural and health systems and policies are not meeting current 
and projected future global food, nutrition and health needs.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 65  
Despite major investmen t in agricultural and nutrition research and its uptake and application, there 
is significant social and geographic inequality in who benefits from these investments. 
Furthermore, in many developing countries, public extension systems for agriculture, heal th and 
nutrition are inefficient, have limited capacity and have a poor track record of delivery, especially in 
terms of supporting women and girls and the most marginalised populations ( Alston, Wyatt, 
Pardey, Marra and Chan -Kang  2000; Anderson 2007; IFPRI  2010; Van den Berg and Jiggins 
2007).  
Several research and mobile network operators (MNOs) are testing a range of information and 
communication technology (ICT) solutions for improving access to a wide range of information and 
advisory services. Mobile ph one based technologies are among the most promising ICT strategies, 
although current initiatives in nutrition are relatively small and fragmented.  
What is mNutrition?  
Enhancing access to the results of nutrition and agricultural research and development is  
potentially critical for improving the nutrition, health and livelihoods of smallholders and rural 
communities. mNutrition will harness the power of mobile phone based technologies and the 
private sector to improve access to information on nutrition, heal th and agricultural practices 
especially for women and farmers (both male and female). Specifically, mNutrition will initiate new 
partnerships with business and science to deliver a range of services including:  
• An open -access database of nutrition and agri culture messages for use in mobile phone based 
communication (for example, information and behaviour change messages on practices and 
interventions that are known to have a direct impact on nutrition or an indirect impact via for 
example agriculture);  
• A suite of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture information, extension and registration 
services designed to: improve knowledge and generate beneficial behaviour change in nutrition 
and agriculture; increase demand for nutrition, health and agriculture  goods and services; 
register and identify target populations for support; and, using real -time monitoring, support the 
conduct of nutrition risk assessments by community health workers.  
The impacts of mNutrition are expected to include improved nutrition,  food security and livelihoods 
of the poor, especially women in 10 countries in Africa (Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, 
Mozambique, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia) and 4 countries in South Asia 
(Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) . This impact will result from the increased scale and 
sustainability of mobile phone based nutrition and agricultural -based information services, 
delivered through robust public private partnerships in each country.  
mNutrition has two major outcomes. One  outcome will be cost -effective, sustainable business 
models for mobile phone enabled nutrition and agriculture services to 3 million households in 10 
countries in Africa and 4 countries in South Asia that can be replicated in other countries.  Linked to 
this outcome, the second outcome will expect these services to result in new knowledge, behaviour 
change and adoption of new practices in the area of agriculture and nutrition practices among the 
users of these mobile phone based services.   
These outcomes wi ll be achieved through four outputs:  
• Improved access to relevant mobile based health, nutrition and agricultural advisory services 
for 3 million poor people and community health workers across 10 SSA and 4 Asian countries;  
• Launch and scaling of mobile pho ne based health, nutrition and agricultural advisory services 
targeted to poor people and community health workers;  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 66  
• Generation and dissemination of high quality research and evidence on the impact, cost -
effectiveness and sustainability of mobile phone base d advisory services in nutrition and 
agriculture in South Asia and SSA; and  
• Development of locally relevant content for mobile phone technology based  agriculture and 
nutrition services meeting demands from users and community health workers.  
In terms of promoting behaviour change and/or adoption of new practices, mNutrition will seek to 
achieve changes in one or more of the following areas:  
• Adoption o f new agricultural practices that are nutrition sensitive, improve agricultural 
productivity and utilise post -harvest technologies  
• Changes in nutrition practices in either one or several knowledge domains including improved 
maternal nutrition practices dur ing pregnancies; infant and young child feeding practice; and 
micro -nutrient supplementation to children at risk (i.e. Vitamin A, Zinc and Oral Rehydration 
Solution (ORS)).  
mNutrition has started implementation from September 2013. For the 2 countries sele cted for the 
impact evaluation (Tanzania and Ghana), mobile network operators and content providers have 
been identified through a competitive process during the first half of 2014. The MNOs and content 
providers started developing and launching their serv ices during the 4th quarter of 2014 and early 
2015. The mobile phone based advisory services are expected to run at least till 3rd quarter of 
2018.  
mNutrition Project Coordination  
DFID support to mNutrition will be channelled to GSMA, as well as directly to this associated 
independent external impact evaluation. GSMA is a global body that represents the interests of 
over 800 mobile operators. GSMA already works with the major mobile operators across Africa, 
(including Airtel, MTN, SafariCom/VodaCom) with a  collective mobile footprint of more than 67 % 
of total African connections. GSMA has a number of existing development initiatives, including 
mHealth and mFarmer, that are part of GSMA’s Mobile for Development which brings together 
mobile operator members,  the wider mobile industry and the development community to drive 
commercial mobile services for underserved people in emerging markets. GSMA will provide 
technical assistance to mobile phone operators, and support new partnerships with content 
providers t o develop and scale up new nutrition and agriculture message services. GSMA will 
ensure sharing of best practices and promote wider replication and uptake of effective business 
models.  
Objective and Main Questions  
 
The objective of this work is to conduct an external evaluation of the impacts and cost -
effectiveness of the nutrition and agriculture advisory services provided by mNutrition compared to 
alternative advisory services available in the two selected countries (Ghana and Tanzania), with 
particular a ttention paid to gender and poverty issues. The impact assessment is required to 
answer the following questions that relate to impact, cost -effectiveness and commercial viability:  
• What are the impacts and cost -effectiveness of mobile phone based nutrition and agriculture 
services on nutrition, health and livelihood outcomes, especially among women, children and 
the extreme poor?  
• How effective are mobile phone based services in reaching, increasing the knowledge, and 
changing the behaviour, of the specific t arget groups?  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 67  
• Has the process of adapting globally agreed messages to local contexts led to content which is 
relevant to the needs of children, women and poor farmers in their specific context?  
• What factors make mobile phone based  services effective in promoting and achieving 
behaviour change (if observed) leading to improved nutrition and livelihood outcomes?  
• How commercially viable are the different business models being employed at country level?  
• What lessons can be learned abo ut best practices in the design and implementation of mobile 
phone based nutrition services to ensure a) behaviour change and b) continued private sector 
engagement in different countries?  
Further evaluation questions related to other aims of mNutrition wi ll be addressed in at least 1 
country (either Ghana and/or Tanzania):  
• Are mobile phone based services a cost -effective way to register and identify at risk 
populations to target with nutrition support?  
• Are mobile phone based services a cost -effective way f or community health workers to improve 
the quality and timeliness of data surveillance (a core set of nutrition -related indicators)?  
The content for the mobile phone based advisory services will be based on international best 
practices and widely endorsed protocols (i.e. by the World Health Organisation) and evidence -
based nutrition -sensitive agricultural practices identified by international experts. Through an 
iterative multi -stakeholder process, international and country experts will localise and adapt t he 
content to make it relevant to the specific target audience in the 14 countries. The adapted content 
and nature of messages is expected to vary across specific target audiences within and across 
countries. The main purpose of assessing the relevance of the content is not to evaluate the 
overall health and nutrition content but on how this content has been localised and adapted and to 
what extent the needs of the specific target groups within their particular context have been met.  
In assessing the comme rcial viability, it is recognised that evaluating the sustainability/long -term 
financial viability of the mobile phone based advisory services will be difficult as mobile network 
operators may not be willing to provide this potentially commercially sensiti ve information. 
Therefore, GSMA will provide support through its access to aggregated confidential financial 
results of the mobile network operators providing the service. GSMA will provide a financial 
summary report on the commercial viability of the busi ness models without compromising the 
commercial sensitivity of the data for the mobile network operators. The evaluator will assess and 
validate commercial sustainability through an analysis of the aggregated information provided by 
GSMA and additional qua litative business analysis approaches.  
The Evaluator has the option of proposing refinements of the existing evaluation questions during 
the inception phase as part of developing the research protocol. These suggestions will be 
considered by the Steering C ommittee and an independent peer review during the review of the 
research protocol as part of the inception phase.  
Output  
The output of this work will be new and robust evidence on the impact, cost -effectiveness and 
commercial viability of mobile phone based advisory services focusing on nutrition and agriculture 
delivered by public and private partners, and including the development of robust methodological 
approaches to impact assessment of phone based advisory services.

Recipient  
The primary r ecipient of this work will be DFID, with the beneficiaries being GSMA, governments, 
international agencies, foundations, MNOs and other private companies and civil society involved 
in policies and programmes in nutrition and agriculture that are aimed at i mproving nutritional, 
health and agricultural outcomes. The findings of this impact evaluation are intended as global 
public goods.  
Scope and timeline  
 The scope of this work is to:  
• Develop a research protocol for the external evaluation of mNutrition;  
• Design and undertake an external evaluation of mNutrition in two countries: Ghana and 
Tanzania;  
• Contribute to the communication of the learning agenda, evaluation strategy and evaluation 
results.  
The evaluation will be in two of the 14 mNutrition target coun tries; Ghana and Tanzania. These 
countries have been selected based on the phased start -up of mNutrition programme activities. 
The focus and approach in the two respective countries will be different allowing for a comparison 
of the effectiveness of approa ches applied. In Tanzania, mNutrition will focus on mobile phone 
technology based nutrition and health services and registration and identification of target 
population. In Ghana, the mobile phone technology will focus on nutrition and agriculture sensitiv e 
services .  
In terms of coverage in number of people being targeted for these services, in total 3 million people 
will be reached through mNutrition; including 2 million for nutrition sensitive agriculture advisory 
messages in 4 Asian and at least 2 Afric an countries and about 1 million beneficiaries for mobile 
phone based nutrition services in 10 countries in SSA.   
The evaluation contract period will be September 2014 to 31st December 2019. The development 
of the research protocol must be completed by mon th 4 for review and approval by DFID. Full 
details on tasks and deliverables are provided in sections below.  
Statement on the design of the mNutrition evaluation  
The evaluation design is expected to measure the impact, cost -effectiveness and commercial 
viability of mNutrition, using a mixed methods evaluation design and drawing on evidence from two 
case study countries and the M&E system of the programme.  Overall, the proposed design should 
ensure that the evidence from the two case study countries has high  internal validity and 
addresses the priority evidence gaps identified in the Business Case. Being able to judge the 
generalisability/replicability of lessons learned from the programme is of equal importance and so a 
credible approach to generalization an d external validity will be an important component of the 
overall evaluation design. The final evaluation design and methodology to generate robust 
evidence will be discussed in detail with DFID and GSMA before implementation.  
For assessing cost -effectiven ess, the Evaluator will further fine -tune their proposed evaluation 
approach and outline their expectations in terms of data they will require from implementers. A 
theory based evaluation design, using mixed methods for evaluating the impact has been 
propo sed. During the inception phase, the Evaluator will put forward a robust evaluation design for 
the quantitative work, either an experimental or a quasi -experimental method, with a clear outline Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 69  
of the strengths and limitations of the proposed method relati ve to alternatives. During the 
inception phase, the Evaluator is also expected to identify clearly what will be the implications of 
the design for implementers in terms of how the overall programme would be designed and 
implemented and for evidence to be c ollected in the programme’s monitoring system. The 
Evaluator will also assess the degree to which it is realistic to assess impacts by early 2019 for a 
programme where implementation started mid -2015 and, if there are challenges, how these would 
be managed . 
The Evaluator, in its 6 monthly reports, will be required to provide information to feed into the DFID 
Annual Review and Project Completion Report of mNutrition.  
Gender and inclusiveness  
 
The impact evaluation will pay particular attention to gender and other forms of social 
differentiation and poverty issues. From current experiences, it is clear that access to and use of 
mobile services is differentiated along a range of factors, includin g gender, poverty, geographic 
marginalisation, education and illiteracy levels. Therefore, the impact evaluation will look at and 
analyse differentiated access to and potential utilisation of mobile phone based services for 
improved nutrition and agricultu ral production. Based on the findings, it will identify opportunities 
and challenges in having an impact on women in general and more specifically the poor and the 
marginalised.   
Tasks  
 
The Evaluator  will perform the following tasks:  
A. Finalise a coherent  and robust evaluation approach and methodology based on their 
proposal (inception phase)  
• Conduct landscape analysis of existing experiences in mobile phone based services for 
nutrition and agriculture based on available publications and grey project docum ents to identify 
additional critical lessons and priorities for evidence gathering and programme design and 
implementation;  
• Ensure that gender issues and poverty issues are well integrated into the impact evaluation 
design;  
• Develop robust sampling framewo rks, core set of indicators and research protocols that allow 
the consistent measurement and comparison of impacts across study countries, taking into 
account differences in business models and programmes as needed;  
• Work closely with mNutrition programme t eam in GSMA to familiarise them with impact 
assessment methodology, discuss evaluation approaches, identify and agree on data provided 
by programme monitoring system and possible modifications to design;  
• Identify risks to the evaluation meeting its object ives and how these risks will be effectively 
managed;  
• Review existing evaluation questions and if deemed relevant propose refinement of existing 
questions and/or add other questions;  
• Prepare a research protocol, including an updated workplan, project mil estones and budget. 
The research protocol will be subject to an independent peer review organised by DFID; and  
• Develop a communication plan.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 70  
B. Implement and analyse evaluations of impact, cost -effectiveness and commercial 
viability in accordance with est ablished best practices  
• Based upon the agreed evaluation framework, develop and test appropriate evaluation 
instruments which are likely to include data collection forms for households, community health 
workers, service providers including health and agricultural services, conten t providers and 
private sector stakeholders including mobile network operators. Instruments will involve both 
quantitative and qualitative methods;  
• Register studies on appropriate open access study registries and publish protocols of studies 
where appropri ate;  
• Conduct baselines and end -lines, qualitative assessments and business model assessments in 
both of the two impact evaluation countries;  
• Conduct and analyse the evaluations and present findings in two well -structured reports 
addressing the evaluation questions. The reports should follow standard reporting guidelines 
as defined by, for example, the Equator Network. Primary findings should be clearly presented 
along with a detailed analysis of the underlying reasons why the desired outcomes were/were 
not achieved;  
• The Evaluating Organisation or Consortium may subcontract the administration of surveys and 
data entry, but not the supervision of those tasks, study design, or data analysis; and  
• The country -specific mixed methods evaluation reports, cost effe ctiveness and business 
models studies and final evaluation report will be subject to an independent peer review 
organised by DFID . 
C. Contribute to the communication of the learning agenda, impact evaluation strategy, and 
evaluation results.  
• Develop a comm unication plan outlining the main outputs and key audiences;  
• Conduct lessons learnt workshops in each of the 2 impact evaluation countries and key 
dissemination events; and  
• Assist in communicating the results of the evaluation and contribute to the develo pment and 
communication of lessons learnt about mobile phone based extension approaches in nutrition 
and agriculture.  
Deliverables  
 
The Evaluator  will deliver the following outputs39: 
During the design and study inception phase of maximum 4 months:  
• A publishable landscape analysis report highlighting lessons learnt from existing initiatives on 
mobile phone based advisory services related to nutrition and agriculture by month 4;

Research protocol and all final reports will be independently peer reviewed.  This will be organised 
by DFID. Outputs are expected to be of sufficiently quality so that a synthesis of findings can be 
published in a leading peer -reviewed journal.  
Coordination and reporting requirements  
 
A mNutrition Advisory Group (AG) will be esta blished for the programme which will a) provide 
technical oversight and b) maximise the effectiveness of the programme.  The Advisory Group will 
meet on a bi -annual basis and comprises of representatives of DFID, NORAD and GSMA 
representatives and independe nt technical experts. The Evaluator will be managed by DFID on 
behalf of the mNutrition Advisory Group. The Evaluator will work closely with the mNutrition 
programme team in GSMA and its specific country implementing partners. The Evaluator will:  
• Ensure c oherence and lesson learning across all pilot impact assessments on the key 
evaluation questions and indicators identified.  
• Incorporate a clear code of ethics; incorporate plans for open access publications and public 
access to data sets.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 72  
The Evaluator wi ll work closely with the mNutrition project management team, in particular in the 
design of the overall evaluation framework and the evaluation plan for the specific project 
components and the countries selected for the evaluation. Collaboration and regula r 
communication between Evaluator and mNutrition project management team and implementing 
partners in selected case study countries is crucial as the evaluation design may have implications 
for project implementation and vice versa. The mNutrition project management team will lend 
support in communication as requested by the Evaluator or the Advisory Group. The Evaluator will 
report directly to DFID who will manage the evaluation on behalf of the mNutrition Advisory Group.  
The main point of contact for tech nical matters is Louise Horner, Livelihoods Adviser and Hugh 
McGhie, Deputy Programme Manager for all other project related issues. The mNutrition Advisory 
Group will be the arbiter of any disputes between the evaluation function and the overall 
programme implementation.  
At the end of each 6 months, the Evaluator will submit a brief report outlining key achievements 
against the agreed deliverables. Pre -agreed funding will then be released provided that 
deliverables have been achieved.      
In addition to th e 6 monthly reports outlined above, the Evaluator will provide information to feed 
into the DFID Annual Review of mNutrition. The 6 monthly reports will be a key source of 
information used to undertake the Annual Review and Project Completion Report for th e 
programme. These reviews will be led by the Livelihoods Adviser and Deputy Programme 
Manager, in consultation with the mNutrition AG. All reviews will be made available publicly in line 
with HMG Transparency and Accountability Requirements.   
Mandatory fi nancial reports include an annual forecast of expenditure (the budget) disaggregated 
monthly in accordance with DFID’s financial year April to March.  This should be updated at least 
every quarter and any significant deviations from the forecast notified to  DFID immediately.  In 
addition the Evaluator will be required to provide annual audited statements for the duration of the 
contract.   
Contractual Arrangements  
 
The contract starts in September 2014 and will run till end of December 2019 subject to 
satisfactory performance as determined through DFID’s Annual Review process. Progression is 
subject to the outcome of this review, strong performance and agreement to any revised work 
plans or budgets (if revisions are deemed appropriate).   
A formal break clause in the contract is included at the end of the inception period. Progression to 
the implementation phase will be dependent on strong performance by the Evaluator during the 
inception period and delivery of all inception outputs, including a revised p roposal for 
implementation period.  Costs for implementation are expected to remain in line with what has been 
agreed upon for this contract, with costs such as fee rates fixed for contract duration.  DFID 
reserves the right to terminate the contract after t he inception phase if it cannot reach agreement 
on the activities, staffing, budget and timelines for the implementation phase.   
DFID reserves the right to scale back or discontinue this assignment at any point (in line with our 
Terms and Conditions) if it  is not achieving the results anticipated. The Evaluator will be 
remunerated on a milestone payment basis. DFID has agreed an output based payment plan for 
this contract, where payment will be explicitly linked to the Evaluator’s performance and effective 
delivery of programme outputs as set out in the ToR and approved workplan. The payment plan for 
the implementation phase will be finalised during the inception period.

e-Pact 73  
Open Access  
The Evaluator  will comply with DFID’s Enhanced and Open Access Policy . Where appropriate the 
costs of complying with out open access policy should be clearly identified within your co mmercial 
proposal.  
Branding  
The public has an expectation and right to know what is funded with public money.  It is expected 
that all research outputs will acknowledge DFID support in a way that is clear, explicit and which 
fully complies with DFID Branding Guidance.  This will include ensuring that all publications 
acknowledge DFID’s support.  If press releases on work which arises wholly or mainly from the 
project are planned this should be in collaboration with DFID’s Communications Department.    
Duty of Care  
The Evaluator is responsible for the safety and well -being of their Personnel (as defined in Section 
2 of the Contract) and Third Parties affected by their activities under this contract, including 
appropriate security arrangements. The Evaluato r is responsible for the provision of suitable 
security arrangements for their domestic and business property.  DFID will share available 
information with the Evaluator on security status and developments in -country where appropriate.  
The Evaluator is resp onsible for ensuring appropriate safety and security briefings for all of their 
Personnel working under this contract and ensuring that their Personnel register and receive 
briefing as outlined above. Travel advice is also available on the FCO website and the Evaluator 
must ensure they (and their Personnel) are up to date with the latest position.  
The Evaluator has confirmed that:  
• The Evaluator fully accepts responsibility for Security and Duty of Care.  
• The Evaluator understands the potential risks and h ave the knowledge and experience to 
develop an effective risk plan.  
• The Evaluator has the capability to manage their Duty of Care responsibilities throughout the 
life of the contract.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

Annex C  Review of the business model  
C.1 Introduction  
This section is structured around the Osterwalder and Pigneur canvas building blocks, 
summarising the key observations made in the baseline report and then supplementing the 
narrative with additional findings from the intervening period, as well as finding s from both the 
qualitative and quantitative studies.  
C.2 The Osterwalder and Pigneur framework  
The O&P framework is commonly used as a framework or canvas for describing a business model.   
Businesses rarely have a simple model of selling a product and gaini ng revenue from that product.  
A simple income vs expenditure model rarely describes the business.  Instead, a product might 
enhance the brand of a company, or enhance the overall experience of the consumer, causing 
them to buy other associated goods or se rvices.  This idea was at the very heart of the submission 
of GSMA to FCDO .  The logical framework of the GSMA grant application, described in the next 
section, discusses indirect benefits or imputed benefits.   
In order to map the various components of th e business model and to capture these indirect or 
imputed effects (beneficial or otherwise), we use the O&P canvas.  The nine elements  (or building 
blocks)  of the canvas form the basis of our analysis below  (see Figure 23). Note that we propose 
amending the framework slightly by splitting the Revenue building block into two components, 
considering cash generated and imputed benefits separately, and splitting Costs into t wo, 
considering operating costs and previous investments separately. This has been proposed 
because of the importance of indirect costs to VAS business models, and because some of the key 
resources brought to partnerships have benefited from prior investme nts. Table 5 presents a 
generic overview of the framework, i.e. the descriptions and example questions illustrate how the 
framework is applied to busi ness models in general, so not all are directly relevant or applicable to 
the Wazazi Nipendeni service.

C.3 Customer segments  
At registration, use rs are allocated to one of four categories:  
• pregnant women;  
• mothers with newborns;  
• supporters (of pregnant women or young mothers); and  
• general interest.  
The registration database provided by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP c overs users registered onto the 
system during a two -year period from November 2016 to November 2018. During this time, many 
women who were originally registered as pregnant women had given birth, and were then re -
categorised on the system as mothers with n ewborns. Figure 24 shows that these women make up 
the vast majority of active users.

Phone ownership and access are key to accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service. Having at least 
one household member that owned a phone was part of the screening criteria for the quantitative 
study,  so it cannot provide any insights into linkages between the service and phone ownership. 
The qualitative study found that many women did not own a mobile phone, but across Tanzania as 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 78  
a whole 77% of women own a phone, compared with 86% of men, giving only  an 11% gender gap 
(Rowntree, 2019), although this GSMA report shows that the gap is higher in rural communities.  
In terms of access, men were reluctant to let their wives have phones, fearing they would be used 
to facilitate affairs, and women themselves  recognised that phone ownership can cause problems 
in the family because of trust issues. Among young, married women, who are the primary customer 
segment, it tends to be husbands who control their access to phones, either through consent to 
ownership, by  buying a handset/ SIM for their wives, or by sharing their own phones with their 
wives.  
Given this understanding of household gender dynamics, men are recognised as a key customer 
segment and were targeted in the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign materials, which  focus on the role 
of couples in bringing up children. However, Figure 24 indicates that supporters, the category that 
includes husbands (among others, such as mothers -in-law), make up only a small proportion of 
Wazazi Nipendeni users.  
The quantitative research specifically addresses these gender issues and was designed to explore 
the impact of actively engaging men in health messaging on health outcomes. It included a s econd 
stage of randomisation in which households where both pregnant women and their partner own 
distinct mobile phones were split into two groups – in one group only the woman received the 
messages, and in the other group both men and women received messa ges. The study found that 
‘estimates for the households that received the content on both mobile phones (the T -F+M group) 
are, in general, not distinguishable from zero and occasionally suggest that these households 
perform worse than those assigned to jus t receive the content on the primary female’s mobile 
phone (the T -F group).’ (Gilligan et al., forthcoming, 2020). 
This is a particularly interesting finding as it appears counterintuitive. Notwithstanding the 
characteristics of the sub -sample used for thi s experiment (households in which both the mother 
and father owned a mobile phone tended to be better off), it suggests that women were not 
substantially constrained by their partners in their ability to take action based on messages. Note 
that this findin g does not contradict findings from the qualitative study on the importance of 
enlisting men’s support for (if not participation in) the Wazazi Nipendeni service as a means of 
facilitating women’s access to content. For example, the quantitative study foun d that women’s 
access to Wazazi Nipendeni messages was less reliable if husbands received the messages, as 
they often did not share them with their partners. They also found that men often disagreed with 
some content, particularly that on family planning, in which case they would withhold access to the 
messages and would not share information with their partners.  
As a national service that is available through multiple networks, Wazazi Nipendeni is available all 
across the country, wherever there is networ k coverage. It does not, therefore, have a particular 
poverty focus – it is not specifically targeted at poor or rural families. GSMA found that the service 
was reaching people with less education, primarily due to assisted registrations. Registrations wer e 
assisted by field partners, who were running programmes that tended to focus on more rural areas. 
These users, therefore, tended to have lower income and education levels. Interestingly, the 
quantitative study found some evidence that the effect on child  diets was larger among better off 
households (in the study sample). There are many characteristics of better off households that 
could account for this:  
• they are more likely to have access to other sources of nutrition information, such as 
government health workers, health facilities, or more knowledgeable peers;  
• individuals in wealthier households may have higher rates of literacy and education, making 
them better able to understand messages;  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 79  
• they have more cash to implement recommendations in messages, e.g. purchasing animal -
sourced foods.  
The fact that the service is text based (in Swahili) will mean that it is likely to be of limited value to 
illiterate  sections of the population. The qualitative study found examples of literate men sharing 
messages with their illiterate partners. Having at least one household member who was literate in 
Swahili was one of the screening criteria for the quantitative surve y, so it was not able to explore 
linkages with literacy.  
C.4 Value proposition  
The original Wazazi Nipendeni multimedia campaign directed women to health services, and to the 
text messaging service  provided by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP. The aim of the SMS cont ent was 
to encourage women to avail themselves of health services targeted at improved neonatal health 
outcomes.  This content covered a range of pregnancy and motherhood topics, and included a 
number of nutrition -related messages.  The GSMA mNutrition project strengthen ed the service by 
contributing substantial additional nutrition content . A first set of messages were added that 
coincided with the scope of the Wazazi Nipendeni existing messages (covering pregnancy and up 
to 16 weeks post -partum), and  a further 128 messages were added  later, covering life stages up to 
five years.  
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP brought to the GSMA mNutrition partnerships a pre -existing database 
of messages targeting pregnant women and new mothers, which had been dev eloped over a 
number of previous partnerships, each of which had a slightly different thematic focus. Messages 
cover ed several pregnancy and motherhood related topics, not just nutrition.  The list of topics 
includes:  
• prevention of mother -to-child transmiss ion of HIV/ Aids; 
• antenatal care ; 
• family planning ; 
• malaria prevention ; 
• nutrition (for mother and baby) ;  
• danger signs ; 
• having an individual birth plan ; and  
• post-partum care.  
A key feature of the GSMA mNutrition programme content generation process was its e mphasis on 
quality of information. The global content partnership41 was responsible for identifying relevant 
content and specifying content validation and quality control processes. After the original ‘one -stop 
shop’ concept was abandoned, Every1Mobile (UK -based)  and COUNSENUTH, a Tanzanian NGO 
working in nutrition, worked together to localise the content to make it relevant and accessible to 
Tanzanian users. TFNC was instrumental in ensuring that the content was accessible and 
consistent with national nutr ition strategies. TFNC shared its responsibilities with other members of 
the National Nutrition Social and Behaviour Change Communication Technical Working group 
(SBCC TWG).   
UX research was conducted early on in the project to ensure that messages were ap propriate. 
GeoPoll tested a small sub -sample of messages for comprehension and relevance. It sent SMS 
 
41 CABI, GAIN, Oxfam, the International Livestock Research Institute, and the British Medical Journal . Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 80  
messages to two groups of 25 women, followed by a series of evaluation questions, also sent by 
SMS. ThinkPlace  conducted user focused research using human -centred design principles.  The 
research was based on semi -structured individual interviews and user profiling. They then 
generated a set of four ‘personas’ intended to assist with the design of the messages. Frog later 
conducted further UX research based on in -depth inte rviews with 16 participants, which added an 
additional three personas. These research activities, funded through the mNutrition programme, 
helped with two aspects of product development: the Geo Poll and Think Place activities looked at  
the messages and how they might fit with different types of consumers (the archetypes ), while the 
Frog research considered how to improve the customers ’ experience of the service.  
Evidence from the quantitative study appears to confirm the quality of mess ages. Household 
members in treatment households were overwhelmingly likely to read the mNutrition content they 
received on their phone. Between 82.7% and 91.6% of households read all the mNutrition content 
they received. Not reading any of the received mNu trition messages was extremely uncommon 
(only between 0.1 and 1.3 % of households). This indicates that the messages are highly valued, 
and this is confirmed by the finding that over 90% of users either always or very often found the 
messages useful (see  Figure 25). Figure 26 shows that information on maternal nutrition was 
regarded as  most useful (but not by a large margin). The quantitative study also found that over 
90% of users (93.5% of females and 92.2% of males) would recommend the service (likely or 
highly likely). Conversely, only 1% of users would not recommend the service. Th ese data suggest 
a high level of satisfaction with the content in the mNutrition service.

Perhaps more importantly, most users reported having taken action  based on the messages 
received. 89% of females and 81% of males self -reported implementing at least one tip. The types 
of information that users were able to implement are presented in  Figure 27 . Interestingly, maternal 
nutrition, which was regarded as th e most useful area of information, was least likely to have been 
acted on. There may be additional barriers to adopting these behaviours that information alone is 
not able to overcome.  
Findings from the quantitative study appear to confirm that users did indeed change their 
behaviours, as it found that accessing the Wazazi Nipendeni service had improved a range of 
nutritional outcomes. Diets among young children in the treatment sample had improved, as 
follows:  
• Dietary diversity for children aged 6–35 mont hs – The number of food categories consumed 
increased by 0.107 (p -value 0.073).  
• The likelihood that children  aged  6–35 months met the minimum dietary diversity – Children in 
the treatment communities were 3.8 percentage points more likely to have consumed from four 
food groups (p -value 0.093).  
• Children aged 6–23 months in the treatment communities were 6.9 percentage points more 
likely to satisfy minimum acceptable diet.  
Note that households were included in the baseline sample if they had a pregnant woman or a 
child under the age of 12 months, so by the time of the endline survey children would have been 
aged between 18 to 36 months, so this is the age group for which it might be expected to find the 
strongest effects.  
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 82  
Diets among women of reproductive age  (primary females) had also improved:  
• The likelihood that the primary females satisfied minimum dietary diversity for women  had 
increased by 4.0 percentage points (p -value 0.062).  
Secondary outcomes relating to knowledge and behavioural practices had also improved:  
• There were improved knowledge of IYCF practices among men.  
• There was a statistically significant impact on the combined household -level measure of 
nutrition knowledge.

The text messages provide women with information that is consistent with advice given by health 
workers in the field.  Where women are in contact with heal th workers, the text messaging service 
then has the additional benefit of reinforcing  the advice that women receive from multiple sources.  
C.5 Channels  
The multimedia campaign targeted users through a comprehensive range of channels:  
• mass media: TV, radio, new spapers, and magazines;  
• print media: brochures, billboards, and vinyl banners;  
• other promotional items: stickers, tyre covers, t -shirts, bags, kanga;  
• electronic media: SMS service, blog; and

• social media: community events, Facebook.  
 
The 2015 Tanzania DHS survey asked respondents about the Wazazi Nipendeni campaign. Over 
half of respondents had heard of Wazazi Nipendeni ( Table 6 ). Radio was clearly the single channel 
that achieved greatest reach : 87% of people had heard about Wazazi Nipendeni from the radio  
(Table 7). About a quarter of respondents had heard about the campaign on the television, with 
another quarter doing so through printed media (poster/ magazine/ newspa per/ billboard).

During the initial campaign as part of the Tanzania Capacity and Communication Project (TCCP) , 
printed materials were distributed to a range of health facilities where women come into contact 
with health professionals, e.g. hospitals, health centres, dispe nsaries. The mHealth Tanzania -PPP 
worked in partnership with the health sector, providing training for health professionals, who were 
then able to help women register on the system. There are three  ways of registering for the Wazazi 
Nipendeni text messagin g service:  
• Assisted by health facility worker – women can be signed up when they come for antenatal 
care visits etc.  
• Assisted by community health workers – community workers can sign women up when they 
visit them in their homes, or other local venue s.  
 
42 Multiple response – respondents may have heard of Wazazi Nipendeni through multiple channels, i.e. adds up to more 
than 100%.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 84  
• Self-registration – instructions were given in the multimedia campaign.  People dial the short  
code and then are guided through a small number of profiling questions (category of user, and 
stage of pregnancy/ age of child).  
Registration data show that 57% of users were registered by partners. In addition, a proportion of 
other users will also have been helped to register by government health workers. Partners 
generally register users through the USSD service or the API. It is not possible to determine 
exactly how many of the 43% of ‘other’ users actually registered by themselves, but 59% were 
registered using USSD, suggesting that they were in fact registered, or at least assisted with their 
registration, by a partner. This means that up to  83% of users were re gistered by partners. This 
highlights the importance of partners in getting users onto the system.  
Although mass media channels can be effective in raising awareness of the Wazazi Nipendeni 
campaign, it is partners that are instrumental in converting peop le into users. People may lack a 
sufficiently detailed understanding of the product to convince them to register for themselves, 
whereas some personal contact can help get them signed up. TFNC also believes that people who 
register with a health profession al will have a positive bias to comply with messaging, have a better 
understanding of how the service works, and be more likely to appreciate how they can benefit 
from the service. It is likely to be known and trusted individuals who are most influential i n assisting 
with registrations, e.g. community health workers, and community and religious leaders.  
Wazazi Nipendeni was one of five programmes supported by the Tanzania Capacity and 
Communication Project (TCCP)  (see Section 4.3). This was a multi -media behaviour change 
communications programme aimed at improving a range of health issues, with a focus on HIV 
prevention. The five year programme started in 2010 and fini shed in 2016, so it will have achieved 
nearly maximum reach towards the end of 2015, when the DHS survey referred to in  Table 6  was 
conducted.  
A USAID evaluation gives a total budget for the programme of 56 million USD (Field -Nguer et al., 
2014) . The budge t is not disaggregated by project, but by health issue. At the time, Wazazi 
Nipendeni was addressing maternal and child health, malaria, PMTCT and family planning. The 
total budget allocated to these issues was 19 million USD, so the amount allocated to Wa zazi 
Nipendeni would be some fraction of this. In principle, the user numbers achieved by Wazazi 
Nipendeni could be at least partly a result of this investment. Although awareness of Wazazi 
Nipendeni was high in 2015, this was not evident during the qualit ative studies carried out as part 
of the evaluation. The issues were not raised during focus group discussion, and only in the 
midline survey, which specifically explored implementation issues, was any reference made to the 
legacy of TCCP:  
“Both women live d in towns in other regions during that time and had signed up themselves 
after seeing a poster in the health clinic.”  (Barnett et al., 2018).  
It has been shown above that the majority of users were registered by partners. These figures 
suggest that regist ration is driven by face -to-face interactions with health workers. Further research 
would be needed to specifically investigate the extent to which registrations continue to be 
influenced by any residual awareness of Wazazi Nipendeni  from the TCCP activities . 
Figure 28 confirms that health workers are the most highly trusted sources of information on health 
matters (government more so than NGO facil ities). It is interesting to note that even among control 
communities, people have high levels of trust in information from automated text messages. They 
are more likely to trust an SMS than family members, confirming that text messages are regarded 
as bei ng reliable and of high quality. Patterns of who people actually get information from ( Figure Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 85  
29) broadly reflect levels of trust, although they emphasise the importance  of government health 
workers.

At baseline, the qualitative research found evidence that communities were already familiar with 
the use of SMS text messages as a means of disseminating information on health and nutrition 
topics.  Viamo’s 321 service was contracted to provide access to IV R recordings in order to cater 
 
43 Percent  who agree they woul d trust information from each source . 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 86  
for those customers that struggle with written messages. The qualitative research identified a 
number of features of SMS messaging that fits well with women’s lifestyles:  
• text messages can be read repeatedly – audio messages may be heard incorrectly ; 
• as messages remain on the phone, they can be shared with friends and colleagues at any 
time; and  
• text messages are private – they remain on the phone, which tends to be regarded as a 
personal device; audio messages can be overheard by others.  
The quantitative study showed that household members in treatment households were 
overwhelmingly likely to rea d the mNutrition content they received on their phone, indicating that 
sending messages by SMS in Swahili is an effective channel. It should be noted that the SMS 
channel may be particularly well suited to the Tanzanian context, given that literacy levels are 
relatively high (for sub -Saharan Africa)44, and the country is united by the language of Swahili.  
In addition to these features, the quantitative study also found that users had a low attachment to 
their mobile phones (or their SIM, at least). Among p eople who were able to explain why they had 
not received messages (in the previous month), the largest single reason was that they had lost 
their SIM (see  Figure 30 ).

C.6 Customer relationships  
The aims of the customer relationships that Wazazi Nipendeni creates with users can be 
considered to be threefold:  
• Acquisition. Those who were assisted with registrat ion have quite a different relationship with 
the service to those who self -registered. Their ongoing experience of the service depends not 
only on the content of messages, but also on whatever ongoing support and interaction they 
may continue to enjoy from  the field agency. Registration data confirm the importance of field 
partners and the face -to-face interaction they provide in encouraging users to register for the 
service; up to 83% of users were signed up by partners (see Section 5.4).  
• Retention. Several features of the system minimise pain points that might prompt users to 
leave a system. The service is free of charge so there is no need for any billing or paymen t 
processes, both of which can be tricky and cause customers to drop out of the service. Once a 
user’s pregnancy or maternal status has been captured by the registration process, there is no 
need for the system to gather further information from users. Per haps the most important factor 
is the perceived relevance and value of the content itself. Retention levels are high. 
Registration data indicate that the number of people opting out of the service is equivalent to 
roughly 7% of new users in a month. As the  total number of active users grows, the attrition 
rate becomes increasing ly small when expressed as a percentage of the number active users 
e.g. 0.5% at the end of a four-year period.  
• Compliance. The service will achieve greatest impact if it can successf ully persuade people to 
constructively change their behaviours. This depends on the perceived relevance and value of 
the content, and on the motivation of customers to comply with the messages they receive, 
which depends on the perceived trustworthiness of  the content. High levels of satisfaction and 
perceived quality support high retention levels. Nearly 90% of those who self -reported having 
ever received the content  read all messages received, and over 80% self -reported 
implementing at least one tip.  
The study has not been able to generate any insights into the nature of the ongoing support 
provided by partners because locations for both quantitative and qualitative studies were selected 
on the basis of low registration levels (and no partner presence) .  
Wazazi Nipendeni has a strong brand, which is quite distinct from the MNOs that support the 
service, and users tend to view it  as a MoHCDGEC  service , as the Government pushed it through 
the media . Originally , Wazazi Nipendeni was branded a CDC action, b ut it is increasingly 
MoHCDGEC -branded as MoHCDGEC  adopt s more of the service.  Users do not necessarily 
appreciate that the MNOs are paying for the messages . 
Given that most of the funding for the mHealth Tanzania -PPP comes from CDC, it can be argued 
that the most important relationship is that with CDC. Providing evidence that the service is 
delivering improved health outcomes is important. Although commercial viability was a priority for 
FCDO  in their original concept for the mNutrition programme , it is not clear that this is a similar 
priority for other donors and organisations that have supported the service over the years.  
C.7 Revenue streams and indirect benefits  
Wazazi Nipendeni is free of charge to users, so there is no direct revenue stream. The original 
mNut rition  project design was based on the assumption that users would pay for information (e.g. 
via subscriptions)  and that this would provide opportunities for participating organisations to 
develop commercially sustainable business models , even though nutrition information was to be Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 88  
made available using a freemium model . However, late in 2016 the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and 
TFNC held intense negotiations over whether or not Wazazi Nipendeni would be permitted to 
charge for these information services.  In the end, the Government insisted that health information 
should be made available to citizens free of charge.  
The w illingness of users to pay for health and nutrition information has yet to be tested. However, it 
is political pressure that is the main determinant of business models. G overnments across many 
African countries have insisted that health -related information  should be made available for free , as 
national policies state that health services should be made available for free  at the point of 
delivery . 
A key feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service is that it has also been made available free of 
charge to field pa rtner institutions running behaviour change interventions within Tanzania, so no 
direct revenue is generated from partner organisations.  
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP is currently funded by CDC, although the successful functioning of the 
service depends on con tributions by various partner organisations. The service is, therefore, 
vulnerable to any withdrawal of funding from CDC. Current funding is planned to 2020. The service 
also depends on the zero -rating of text messages by partner MNOs.  
Phone numbers are u sed as the unique user identifier on the Rasello platform, so users can only 
register one number (although in principle they could self -register as many numbers as they like). 
Tanzania recently introduced mobile number portability (Tanzania Communications Regulatory 
Authority (TCRA), 2019) but it is unlikely that this is common practice. For example, even 10 years 
after number portability was introduced in South Africa, only 2.5% of the subscriber base port their 
number in a year45 (Independent Comm unicatio ns Authority of South Africa , 2017). Registration 
data from Rasello indicate that drop -out rates are low, which also suggests that use rs are not 
readily changing their mobile numbers. The qualitative research found that most people use 
multiple SIMs, swapp ing them into their phone depending on which network has a signal and which 
offers the cheapest tariff, e.g. time of day, off -net tariffs, and bundle features. In the baseline 
report, it was proposed that the Wazazi Nipendeni VAS could offer MNOs indirect benefits 
associate with reduced churn. However, this has proven not to be the case. The quantitative study 
found no difference in the length of time that respondents reported having had their main SIM card 
(both groups had owned their primary SIM for just under three years, and their second SIM for just 
over two years), there was no difference in the likelihood that they had the same primary phone 
number as they had at baseline (a two -year duration), and there was no difference in the 
proportion who subscri bed to the same operator as at baseline.  
The baseline report also proposed that, as a VAS, Wazazi Nipendeni could lead to an increase in 
ARPU among users, and the quantitative study found that this has indeed been the case. Control 
households spent an aver age of TZS 5,300 per month (£1.90/month) on mobile phone airtime 
(including any data bundles), but spending was 10% higher (TZS 510, £0.18/month) in treatment 
communities. The qualitative study found that women using the Wazazi Nipendeni service became 
more confident in using their phones, which explains the increase in ARPU. They were more likely 
to make and receive calls, more likely to have sent and received text messages, more likely to 
have used mobile money services, and more likely to have used their  phone intensively .46 
The latest DHS data indicate that 53% of people (across the country) had heard of Wazazi 
Nipendeni (see  Table 6 ). TCRA data for October 201847 give the total number of subscribers on 
 
45 Annualised porting rate is taken as the total cumulative ports, divided by the number of years since the service was 
launched.

e-Pact 89  
the four partner networks as 41.0 million. Therefor e, 550,000 Wazazi Nipendeni users represent 
1.3% of the entire subscriber base. Given the reach and positive brand of Wazazi Nipendeni, it is 
surprising that the MNOs supporting Wazazi Nipendeni do not make greater use of their 
contribution and the Wazazi Nipendeni brand in their promotional materials.  
It does appear that MNOs are beginning to recognise the political value attached to their support 
for Wazazi Nipendeni. In an unpredictable political environment in which the Government can 
potentially impose  regulatory constraints (such as taxes), there is political capital to be gained by 
supporting a public good that plays a part in implementing the Government’s health policy. By 
signing agreements to support Wazazi Nipendeni directly with the Government ra ther than with the 
mHealth  Tanzania -PPP, MNOs are gaining recognition of the value of their contribution.  
C.8 Key resources  
Key resources are defined as those assets required to create and offer the value proposition. The 
primary assets employed by the mHealth  Tanzania -PPP in delivering the text messaging service 
are the content database and the applications platform that sends scheduled messages.  
The current content comprises the pre -existing database brought by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP, 
and additional content  generated through the mNutrition programme. This nutrition content is 
regarded as a public good, having been paid for by FCDO . In March 2019, CABI made this content 
publicly available under open access through its Knowledge Bank resource .48.  
The text mes saging service originally ran on the Vusion  platform developed by TTCM in 
partnership with the Praekelt foundation. In October 2016 Wazazi Nipendeni migrated to a new 
platform, created for MoHCDGEC  by a loc al software developer (Rasello).  The new platform offers 
improved reliability as well as improved monitoring and reporting facilities . For example, the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP has been able to equip MNOs with their own dashboard so they can track 
the number of users and messages being sent.   
The text messaging service is designed to serve as part of multimedia campaign s, so the  field 
partner programmes and  interventions are a key resource required to deliver the full potential of 
the value proposition. To date, 24 partners have assisted with  registering users in the field (see 
Section 5.9).  
The key ‘resource’ in convening these partn erships has been, and will continue to be, the 
partnership with TFNC a nd its linkages to  both national nutrition policymakers  and health and 
nutrition interventions launching in the country . TFNC also acts as the moderator of health and 
nutrition content, bringing to the partnership its technical expertise in this area. The content 
localisation and approval process was acknowledged by stakeholders as going particularly 
smoothly as a result of having TFNC on board.  
Early in 2019, the country manager at the mHealth Tanzania -PPP handed over to a new team 
leader. The country mana ger had been intimately involved in the development of the mHealth 
Tanzania -PPP for nearly 10 years. The interesting feature of the new appointment was that while 
the previous country manager came from a mobile technology background, the new team leader is  
a medical professional. This reflects the changing complexion of the PPP, as it continues to 
encourage Government agencies to take ownership of the platform itself, along with associated 
technical responsibilities. Strengthened health resources in the mHe alth Tanzania -PPP leave it 
better able to engage with health policy issues and to broker partnerships with health sector actors.

e-Pact 90  
 
C.9 Key activities  
In order to make the business model work, perhaps the most fundamental activity that needs to be 
undertaken is  networking. Both TFNC and the mHealth Tanzania -PPP clearly have good personal 
contacts in order to broker partnerships with field NGOs, and to enlist the support of MNOs. The 
strength of personalities is likely to become less important as MoHCDGEC assumes  greater 
ownership of the technical platform and is able to integrate participation in the Wazazi Nipendeni 
system into processes required for health interventions to be implemented in country.  
Under the original vision for the mHealth projects under the mNutrition programme, it was expected 
that content delivered by the Global Content Partnership would simply be made available to all 
partners participating in the mHealth service, and that each participating organisation would use 
their own resources to ad apt the key messages to specifically match their target audience and to 
suit their own objectives. This was subject to an obligation (or expectation) that nutrition content 
would then be made available by participating organisations free of charge to users . The Global 
Content Partnership was, therefore, mandated to create higher -level, generic content, and little 
provision was made for creating specific, locally relevant messages. However, when the original 
‘clearing house’ vision was abandoned, there was t hen a need for a new stream of work to create 
specific, locally relevant messages, in the local language, ready to be integrated into the existing 
Wazazi Nipendeni database of content. This was done by the partnership of Every1Mobile and 
COUNSENUTH. Detail ed testing of mHealth content was never part of the original concept, as it 
was expected that local partners would do this for themselves, so additional funding was made 
available to cover end -user testing as part of the localisation process.  
TFNC was the government agency responsible for signing off content at the end of the content 
generation process. However, TFNC adopted a much more proactive role, and its involvement has 
continued to deepen throughout the project. When the content generation process wa s changed to 
facilitate the production of more detailed, localised content, TFNC got more involved. TFNC’s 
engagement with and awareness of the programme played an important role in ensuring that 
signing -off procedures went smoothly.  
Monitoring and evalua tion is a key activity, as evidence of the contribution that Wazazi Nipendeni 
makes towards positive health outcomes will be instrumental in negotiating partnerships with 
forthcoming health interventions. It is expected that the positive outcomes highlight ed by this 
evaluation study will be of value to the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and to TFNC in this regard.  
Providing a face -to-face presence when working with women is important, not only for assisting 
with registration onto the Wazazi Nipendeni system, but also  for achieving positive behaviour 
change. The qualitative study confirmed that messages may play an important role in reinforcing 
and supporting the efforts of health workers. The study found that messages acted as reminders to 
reinforce information provid ed by health workers, and to reinforce mothers’ existing knowledge. 
Note that even though people may trust information given by text messages ( Figure 28), they are 
still most likely to get information from health workers ( Figure 29).  
The core business of delivering content to beneficiaries depends on the technical infrastructure 
that d eals with registration, scheduling, and the dispatch of messages to users. This is sub -
contracted to Rasello, as the platform provider, and management is being gradually transferred 
from the mHealth Tanzania -PPP to MoHCDGEC.  
Content will need to be regularly updated to keep it relevant , e.g. new drugs and products will be 
introduced, and recommended practice will be modified. People will quickly lose trust in information Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report

that is not immediately useful, or , even worse, wrong. Quality assurance processes for any 
revisions ought to be as rigorous as those adhered to during the mNutrition programme . It is not 
clear that any of the partners has the mandate or the funding to undertake  this type of ongoing 
maintenance . 
C.10  Key partnership s 
The complex set of partnerships brokered by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and TFNC is a defining 
feature of the Wazazi Nipendeni service. Partnerships have been crucial to accessing all the 
resources needed to make the service succeed:  
• Research and design. Wa zazi Nipendeni was o riginally conceived as a prevention of malaria in 
pregnancy campaign,  following an analysis by JHCCP  of the 2010 Tanzania DHS data. The 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP delivered the text messaging service as part of the campaign put 
together by JH CCP and MOHSW.  
• Content. Content development for the SMS component of Wazazi Nipendeni was led by 
MOHSW, to ensure messages were developed in line with Government recommendations and 
delivered in line with timing guidelines provided by the World Health Org anization (WHO). 
Further content was leveraged from the Mobile Alliance for Maternal Action .49 Content on family 
planning was leveraged from Mobiles for Reproductive Health (m4RH) .50 Content for 
Prevention of Mother -to-Child Transmission was designed by EG PAF. TFNC was instrumental 
in securing the support of the SBCC TWG for nutrition in approving content.  
• Technology platform. The service was originally run on the Vusion open source platform 
developed by TTCM. The system architecture led to problems with re liability, latency, and cost. 
The service was migrated to a new platform in October 2016. It was hosted locally by Rasello 
and was commissioned and paid for by  MoHCDGEC (with CDC funding).  
• Telecoms operators. The mHealth Tanzania -PPP had identified MNOs a s key partners at the 
start. However, MNOs  needed to be convinced of the viability of the concept before committing.  
The Wazazi Nipendeni campaign was launched without explicit support from MNOs , but after 
the service achieved 100,000 users  within 11 weeks  the MNOs entered into agreements . 
• Field partners. The programme launched in November 2012 with a two -month nationwide 
media campaign (radio and TV). A follow -up campaign ran from July 2013 to February 2014 , 
during which field partners promoted the service  and assisted with registrations. In addition to 
the 24 field partners (see Table 9) that have formal agreements with the mHealth Tanzania -
PPP (and have a source code allocated on the system), other agencies have simply 
incorporated registering women onto Wazazi Nipendeni into their field processes. Analysis of 
registration data suggests  that field partners may have assisted up to 83% of users to register.  
• Government agencies. The Government of Tanzania is committed to a number of relevant 
health policies on nutrition, sexual and reproductive health, and maternal mortality, and to a 
numbe r of information and ICT policies, including open and accountable government, and 
electronic access to health services.  
The network of key institutions is presented in Figure 2. The nature of the relationships covered by 
each category of partners is summarised  in Table 8.

C.11  Costs and investment  
The baseline report presented set -up and ongoing costs covering a two -year period, mainly 
derived from costs reported by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP and GSMA. Now that more detail has 
been provided, these costs have been superseded by a more comprehensive and rigorous 
analysis , which is  presented in Section  7. 
In addition to those costs directly associated with the mHealth Tanzania -PPP (both operating and 
capital), FCDO  and GSMA have invested in wider programmatic costs that stimulated and 
supported this action.  It is worth noting that the mHealth Tanzania -PPP has a history of donations  
and in -kind contributions made over the years by the CDC and programme partners .

Annex D  Analysis of users  
D.1 Overview  
The mHealth Tanzania -PPP submitted Wazazi Nipendeni registration data from the Rasello 
platform to the authors. The query was performed on 27 March 2019. The dataset contains the 
following fields:  
• unique ID (anonymised);  
• source (me ans of registration, e.g. short code, API);  
• partner (who registered the user);  
• category of user (e.g. pregnant woman, mother with child);  
• stage at registration (months or weeks, representing the stage of pregnancy or age of child);  
• registration date;  
• statu s (active or inactive); and  
• opt-out date (for inactive  accounts ). 
The data required considerable manipulation, primarily because when pregnant women reach term 
(and are assumed to give birth), the original record is flagged as inactive and a new record is 
created with a new category of mother with child. Given that most users are women who have 
given birth while registered as users, there were a large number of ‘paired’ records that needed to 
be reconciled and collated. The working dataset includes addition al categories to reflect these 
hybrid classifications, e.g. PW=>MC represents a woman who registered when pregnant but has 
since given birth and has continued using the service as a mother with a child.  
Registration via USSD and API was introduced to make  the registration process faster and easier. 
Registration by API was initially introduced by NHIF in July 2016, then use of API as a registration 
source was adopted by other partners from 10 November 2016 onwards. Registration by USSD 
appears to have been introduced on 10 November 201651 and registrations were submitted by 
multiple partners. However, there is a spike in registrations on this date. 6,833 records were 
submitted on this date: 78% by USSD and 21% by API.  
There appears to be a further anomaly i n registrations completed by USSD in November 2018. 
There is a spike in the number of registrations completed by USSD during the three -week period 
form 4 November 2018 to 24 November 2018. Most of these have no associated partner. There 
are no further regi strations by USSD after this date, which seems unlikely.  
A ‘working’ dataset has been restricted to all records covering a two -year period between 11 
November 2016 and 3 November 2018. The following numbers of records have been omitted:  
• up to and includin g 10 November 2016 – 40,951; and  
• 4 November 2018 onwards – 50,664.  
The following steps were taken in the preparation of the dataset used in the analysis (and 
summarised in  Table 10 ): 
1. Data were submitted in four files, containing a total of 1,179,500 record s.  
 
51 With the exception of 157 records submitted in  the period  August to S eptember 2016 . Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 95  
2. Paired duplicates were collated , and ID errors were omitted from each file, leaving a total of 
853,000 records.  
3. Files were then merged and paired duplicates across years were collated, leaving a total of 
744,000 records.  
4. Records with various unresolvable data were omitted, leaving a total of 739,100 records. 
Omitted records included those with ‘#VALUE’ in the Registration date field, ‘NULL’ in the 
Source field, outliers in the Stage field, and records with an opt -out date as well as an ‘Active’ 
Status.  
5. Migrated accounts (from the Vusion system) were omitted. Staff at the mHealth Tanzania -PPP 
reported that porting data from the old to the new system was fraught with difficulties, resulting 
in inconsistencies in the data on the new platform. For example, 62% of migrated data records 
contained a single registration date (16 November 2016, which corresponds roughly to the date 
the migration took place). All 88,100 migrated records have been omitted.  
6. Anomalies in November 2016 and November 2018 cast doubt over the integrity of data before 
and after these dates, so only data from the intervening two -year period has been used.

D.2 Growth in user numbers  
New registrations fluctuate monthly, as shown in  Figure 31 , and opt -outs fluctuate, as shown in 
Figure 33 . In the period May 2017 – October 2018 new registrat ions were running at an average of 
around 20,000/month, whereas people were leaving the service at a much lower rate of less than 
1,400/month, i.e. 7% of new users. Combining new users with people leaving the service gives the 
cumulative profile of active users presented in  Figure 34. Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 96  
Figure 31:  Monthly registrations  
 
Source: Authors  
As with registration dates, there were anomalies with the opt-out dates (see  Figure 32 ). There was 
a spike in opt -outs on a single day: over 9,000 records were marked as having opted out on 3 April 
2017. The majority of these had been registered using the short code (86%). Secondly, there was 
a one -month gap in w hich no opt -outs were recorded (mid -February – mid-March 2017). Therefore, 
only opt -out data from May 2017 onwards have been considered reliable and are presented in  
Figure 33 . 
Note that the rate at which users opted out of the system was an order of magni tude lower than the 
rate at which they were being registered, so missing opt -out data has minimal effect on the trend of 
calculated active users presented in  Figure 34.

Figure 34:  Growth in active users

In the absence of relia ble data, it is not possible to track patterns of growth in users from the 
introduction of the service. The total number of users may be up to 130,000 higher than these 
figures indicate, because many of the original users that were migrated onto the new sy stem have 
not been included in these numbers (step 4 to step 5 in  Table 10 ). Nevertheless, the patterns of 
growth and opt -outs remain accurate.  
In November 2017, the mHealth Tanzania -PPP estimated the number of active users to be 
350,000. This is consisten t with the active user numbers in  Figure 34, as adding 130,000 to the 
November 2017 estimate of 200,000 from the chart gives a total of 330,000, which is close to the 
mHealth Tanzania -PPP estimate. Making an assumption of straight -line growth in active user 
numbers, and assuming a starting base of 100,000 active users (rounded down), the number of 
active users after a two -year period (December 2016 to November 2018) is estimated at 550,000. 
This figure was validated by the mHealth Tanzania -PPP.  
In their study of all eight health services in the mNut rition programme (GSMA, 2018), GSMA 
presents a chart of the total number of users reached from October 2015 to December 2017. In 
this chart, Wazazi Nipendeni users start from a base of zero in January 2016, rising to 770,000 in 
December 2017. However, thes e figures cannot be compared with the figures above because they 
represent the cumulative number of users reached.  
D.3 Understanding users  
The NHIF has brought the largest number of users onto the system ( Figure 35). This figure also 
shows that, to date, other partners have assisted few users to register relative to the number who 
appear to have self -registered (no partner).  
Among the 11 partners that registered more than 1 ,000 users, all apart from UNICEF used either 
API or USSD exclusively (almost) – see Table 11 . None used the short code. When the USSD 
system was introduced, SMS remained the channel the general public could use to register, but 
healthcare partners moved t o using USSD. The USSD facility makes the registration process 
smoother because it can validate healthcare registration numbers in real time, so it can check if 
people enter incorrect registration data. When looking at users registered with no partner, 62%  
were registered using an API or USSD ( Figure 36 ), suggesting that many could well have been 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 99  
registered with the assistance of a field partner. It was reported that many women would have 
been signed up with the assistance of health workers when they visite d clinics. It is not, therefore, 
possible to determine how many users truly self -registered, i.e. without any assistance. It is 
possible that up to 83% of all users could have been registered with the assistance of some kind of 
partner (official partner, o r health workers), if API and USSD registrations were included.  
An inherent difficulty with USSD sessions was that in areas with poor network coverage, the 
connection would be dropped before the registration process could be completed. It was reported 
that some partners resorted to using short codes, although this is not evident in the data from the 
period represented in  Table 11 . The USSD protocol was subsequently changed so that it was able 
to resume the session automatically. This was a concern as most o f the marketing materials for 
Wazazi Nipendeni were based on the USSD functionality.

The majority of  users (75%) were signed up as pregnant women (sum of ‘PW’ and ‘PW=>MC’ 
categories in  Figure 37 ). 12% were general information -seekers, and 3% were supporters of one 
type or another. However, data in  Table 12  indicate  that by the end of the two -year period , all of 
the general information -seekers and most of the supporters had opted out of the system.

D.4 Partner programmes  
Registration data provide some insights into the ways in which different programmes work. For 
example, the NHIF brings the largest number of people onto the system (see  Figure 35), and  
Figure 38  shows that since numbers picked up i n May 2017, the rate of registrations has been 
roughly constant. This is in contrast with self -registrations, the second largest source of 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 101  
registrations, which fluctuate widely as people respond to local and national campaigns  (see Figure 
39). Although Toto Health is a partner that continues to bring small numbers of users onto the 
system, Figure 40 shows the impact on registrations of what appears to be a nine -month 
programme in the field.  
NHIF ran a pilot project in 5 regions  of the country . They went from facility to facility to sign up 
women for a free health insurance scheme. NHIF normally charge premiums, but this was a 
special programme subsidised by a donor, so i nsurance was made free to consumers in the pilot. 
The pilot was completed at the end of 2018. It was regarded as a success, so a follow up phase 
was planned 4 months ago, which is currently waiting for the government to sign.

D.5 Stage at registration  
As part of the registration process, users were asked what stage of the pregnancy a women was at 
(in months or weeks). For mothers (and supporters), they were asked for the age of the child. 
Figure 41 shows that there  was a peak in registrations of pregnant women at the three -month 
mark, which coincides with the first trimester of pregnancy. Note the small number of women 
registering in the 10th month of their pregnancy: this mostly likely represents women who were 
registered at or around the time they gave birth. Users who were supporting pregnant women also 
tended to sign up at the end of the first trimester (see  Figure 42 ).  
Users have been separated out into those who were registered by one of the partners listed in  
Table 9 , and those who apparently self -registered. Section 6.3 analyses those users with no 
partner and suggests that, in fact, it is likely that most of them were a ssisted by some kind of health 
worker. The spike in registrations at the three -month point is most acute among these users (see  
Figure 43 ). This figure also shows that partners tend ed to register women later, from three to six 
months into their pregnancies .

D.6 Duration of use of service  
Given the relatively low level of people opting out of the service, the sub -set of data that represents 
users who have registered and then left the service is relatively small (n = 25,300) . Remember that 
the addition of nutrition messages means that users remain registered until the child reaches the 
age of five years, so even children registered early in 2016 have not yet reached the age at which 
they will be automatically removed from the system. In principle, users can opt out of the service by 
Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 105  
sending t he word ‘Simama’ to the same number used for self -registrations. In practice, many users 
may not be aware of this.  
Figure 45 shows that most users leaving the system were registered as pregnant women, and that 
they left before giving birth. The relatively low number of women in the ‘PW=>MC’ category 
suggests that women who used the system throughout their pregnancy liked it, and then continued 
to use it in motherhood. Note that this analysis omits a large number of users (61,000) who 
registered as general i nformation -seekers (GIS), but for whom there are no valid opt -out dates.  
Figure 45:  Categories of users leaving the system (with valid opt -out dates)  
 
Source: Authors  
TFNC hypothesised that women who were assisted with registrat ion might have a stronger 
commitment to the service, stay on the service for longer, be more likely to read the messages, 
and be more likely to adopt improved behaviours. Although it has not been possible to explore links 
between categories of users and ou tcomes, Table 13 sheds some light on the number of users 
leaving the service. This shows that of the 290,000 users who were registered by a partner, 80% 
were registered using an API and 18% using the USSD number. While 12% of those registered by 
USSD subsequently dropped out, only 0.3% of API registrations opted out. Among those users 
with no partner, 59% were registered by USSD, and may have been genuinely self -registere d, or 
they may have been assisted by a health worker. However, only the general public continued to 
register using the short code, so 38% of those with no partner can be classified as self -registered 
with some confidence. 42% of these users opted out, whic h provides some evidence to support the 
TFNC hypothesis.

The majority of users drop out of the system within a month of registering  (Figure 46). It is likely 
that this represents people who try the system and, for whatever reason, decide they do not like it 
and opt out straightaway. The second peak occurs after around eight months’ use of the se rvice. 
Given that most users register around three to six months into their pregnancy ( Figure 41 ), this 
peak corresponds to when their child is aged around two to five months old. The reason for this 
peak is less obvious, but may represent mothers who found the service useful during their 
pregnancy, but not useful for helping with their newborn, so a fter persisting with it for a few months 
of motherhood they then decided to opt out.

For all categories of users, the peak period for leaving the system i s within one month. If this period 
is omitted, and the number of users opting out in a given period is expressed as a proportion of the 
total number of users opting out for each category, then different patterns can be seen for different 
categories of user  (Figure 47 ). The second peak for pregnant women and supporters of pregnant 
women occurs after seven months. The distribution of duration of use of the system among women 
who gave birth while using the system is much smoother. Mothers, supporters, and gene ral 
information -seekers leaving the system had all done so within four months.

N.B. the price of SMS messages sent is the subject of debate in Section 7.3. The analysis of 
business models starts using retail prices (as claimed by MNOs) in Sectio n 7.3 (Public Good 
model). After discussing the SMS price issue, it then shifts to using a more realistic bulk purchase 
price in Section 7.4. Then in Section 7.5 the price is dropped to zero, on the basis that this is closer 
to the real cos t to an MNO.  
 
The mHealth  Tanzania -PPP provides a range of mobile health services in addition to Wazazi 
Nipendeni :  
• TAMBUA TB  apps for NTLP ; 
• Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response ; 
• National Blood Transfusion Text Messaging Service ; 
• Nationa l Feedback Mechanism for health services ; 
• Early Infant Diagnosis System  (HIV) ; and  
• NACP FASTA . 
Therefore, the total costs for running the mHealth Tanzania -PPP need to be apportioned. In terms 
of expenditure, Wazazi Nipendeni  accounts for over half of the money as it has higher recurring 
costs (it sends the highest number of messages). However, in terms of employee time, given that 
Wazazi Nipendeni is set up and established, staff effort is currently split roughly 40% on Wazaz i 
Nipendeni  and 60% on other programmes that they are getting off the ground, especially TB 
Tambua and FASTA  TZ, and this has been the case for the last 2 years. T he mHealth Tanzania -
PPP has validated allocating an estimate d 50% of costs to Wazazi Nipenden i as reasonable .

Annex F  Technology and mobile business models  
The majority of mobile internet connections are 2G, and Tanzania’s broadband coverage lags 
behind its neighbours (see  Figure 48). This can be interpreted as meaning that m obile data use is 
set to grow.   
Figure 48:  3G and 4G coverage as % of population (2018)  
 
Source:  Okeleke, (2019)  
GSMA predict s that mobile data consumption across sub -Saharan Africa will multiply sevenfold by 
2024 (from 1.1 to 8.5 GB/subscriber/month)  (GSMA, 2019).  Although 4G is growing and there is a 
good deal of excitement about 5G, 3G internet connections are likely to remain  the dominant 
technology for the medium -term future ( Figure 49 ). Indeed, Figure 50 shows the rapid increase 
over recent years in 3G coverage in Tanzania.

Figure 50:  Connected and unconnected populations in Tanzania  
 
Source:  Okeleke, (2019) . 
The influence of over the top (OTT) services continues to grow. In 2017, 20% of adults in Tanzania 
used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter  (Pew Research Center , 2018) . Use has 
grown by one -third over the three years from 2014 to 2017.  
Esselaar and Stork (201 8) argue t hat with data -driven business models, increased revenue from 
data services can more than make up for any decline in voice revenue from OTT services. They 
present financial data from MTN Ghana as an example of a data -centric business model. Figure 51 
shows how data ha ve generated an increasing share of total revenue, to the point where they are  
likely to generate more revenue than traditional voice and SMS.  
Entertainment services drive a good deal of growth in data use. As TVs become more widespread 
(e.g. d emand for solar home systems is often driven by affordable Light Emitting Diode 
televisions), the affluent are spending more time watching TV and video on mobile devices .53 This 
trend in increased TV and video access is an important feature of the changing  media landscape in 
sub-Saharan Africa countries, and may well have implications for public health communication 
strategies.

Smartphone ownership is a key barrier to extending access to mobile internet services. In 
Tanzania , smartphone ownership stood  at around 13% of adults in 2017, well below the median for 
sub-Saharan Africa (33%)  (Pew Research Center, 2018) . Smartphone sales are on the rise, and 
GSMA estimate s that  the number of handsets will more than double from 2018 to 2025. Adoption 
of smartphones in remote rural areas is likely to be relatively slow, not only because of poor dat a 
network coverage, but also because of the relatively poor battery life offered by cheap 
smartphones. Pew research shows that although only 13% of adults had smartphones, 25% were 
using the internet (note that TCRA data suggest the proportion of internet users may be higher, 
although it does not attempt to identify unique users). This indicates that people find alternative 
means of accessing the internet, e.g. free Wi -Fi hotspots, and some feature phones can support 
internet -enabled services. Nevertheless,  the falling price of smartphones will continue to 
strengthen access to data services : for example, MTN ha s ambitious plans to sell a $20 ‘smart 
feature’ phone that uses the KaiOS operating system to create a smartphone user experience 
providing access to Google and social media apps .54  
Data services will be instrumental in overcoming literacy barriers, as well as providing a richer 
information dissemination experience  (e.g. audio and video ). It is likely, therefore, that the reach 
and efficacy of mobile h ealth services targeting the poorest will improve once they can be delivered 
via smartphones. However, p oor network coverage means that this is unlikely to be the case within 
the medium -term future and , in the meantime, voice -based features (e.g. IVR, outbound dialling , 
call centre) are likely to be the most effective media for engaging with remote and low income 
communities .  
In a mature market, in which almost all potential subscribers are signed up with one MNO or 
another, the strategy of VAS is to encourage subscribers on other networks to transfer (churn), and 
to encourage network subscriber s to stay with the MNO that provides a valuable service, rather 
than switch to competing networks.  This applies to most VAS, but not necessarily to Wazaz i 
Nipendeni, as it is available on all of the major networks in Tanzania.  The Wazazi Nipendeni 
service would not, therefore, provide any incentive for a customer to switch network, but it might 
well encourage them to stay with their current provider.

Perha ps the most transformational technology that has blossomed since the baseline report is 
mobile money. In 2017, 60% of the population had a mobile money account  (Okeleke, 2019) , and 
TCRA figures show a 40% increase in accounts over a three -year period from 2016 to 2019. M-
Pesa (Vodacom) is the market leader in Tanzania , at 40%  market share , and Tigo Pesa is second , 
at 32%.  Okeleke (2019) estimates that the value of transactions processed through mobile money 
services in 2017 was $22 billion, equivalent to al most half of the country’s GDP.

Annex G  Technology mHealth innovations  
The Health Data Collaborative55 has done some interesting work on classifying digital health 
interventions, led by the Digital Health and Interoperability Working Group. It proposes that tools 
can be divided into the following high -level categories56: 
• interventions for clients (e.g. cli ent communication, health tracking, information services, 
financial transactions);  
• interventions for healthcare providers (e.g. client registration, health records, decision support, 
telemedicine, information management, medication management);  
• interventio ns for resource/ health system managers  (e.g. human resources, supply chains, civil 
registrations, health financing, asset and facility management); and  
• interventions for data services  (e.g. data collection, coding, mapping, and exchange).  
Wazazi Nipendeni  assists pregnant women and mothers by providing them with information on 
how to look after themselves and their infant, so it falls into the broad category of client -facing 
tools.  
This section presents examples of health services falling into sub -categor ies in the health data 
collaboration classification: - 
Targeted client communication  
• Transmit  health event alerts to specific population group(s) : 
 U-Report Ebola Response in Uganda: ‘The following SMS alerts were carefully drafted and

Bundibugyo, Kabarole Kyenjojo, Kyegegwa, Kyankwanzi, and  Ibanda. SMS Alert 1: There 
is an Ebola outbreak in Kibaale. Today and tomorrow I am going to send u some SMSs to 
give u more info about how t o recognise Ebola & how to prevent it... ’  
• Transmit targeted health information to client(s) based on health status or demographics :

Personal health tracking  
• Access by client to  own medical records:  
 Digital Weighing Card: ‘This project is therefore seeking to provide a digital copy of every 
child weighing card, such that, it can be accessed via mobile phone whenever needed and 
updated by Community health Workers at any point in t ime.’

 Interactive alerts/Zindagi Mehfooz: ‘A vaccine registry system that uses SMS reminders to 
caregivers and conditional cash transfers to caregiv ers ... The amount of cash the caregiver 
is eligible to win increases with each subsequent vaccine their child completes. ’  
 
The classification makes a clear distinction between services providing unidirectional information 
dissemination to clients (target ed and untargeted) and client -initiated services (peer group, citizen 
reporting, and health information -seeking). Wazazi Nipendeni is an example of the first of these 
and is a ‘push’ service. The Viamo 3 -2-1 service offered by Vodacom, on the other hand, i s an 
example of a client -initiated service and is a ‘pull’ service, as it relies on the user to dial a short 
code to access information. In principle, a service could combine both aspects of communication 
as each has its advantages and drawbacks.  Mobile phones, nutrition, and health  in Tanzania: Business modelling endline report  
e-Pact 118  
It is in teresting to note that most of these examples are based on the SMS functionality of mobile 
phones. This is true even of the tools that deal with financial transactions, as they tend to use a 
platform that manages payments between healthcare providers, but the interaction with the client is 
done by SMS. This reliance on SMS tells us two things. Firstly, SMS is a good enough means of 
communicating with clients (i.e. constraints such as poor network coverage and illiteracy have not 
rendered the services unfeas ible). Secondly, SMS is regarded as the most cost -effective medium 
for communicating with clients. This is closely linked to the first point, as voice -based services 
(such as outbound dialling and call centres) can overcome literacy and language constraint s, but 
come at a much higher cost.  
The classification was drafted in 2017, so more recent examples of mobile health projects exist. 
Many of these are beginning to exploit the potential of the internet, and smartphones in particular, 
of data acquisition an d analysis, and of mobile money services. Some examples are summarised 
below:  
• Babyl (Rwanda)  is a diagnostic service that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning 
with live doctors and nurses to provide medical consultations to anyone with a mobil e device. It 
has over 2,000,000 registered users and has performed over 650,000 consultations. Users pay 
by mobile money. They phone the service  and book an appointment with a triage nurse . The 
nurse  then tells them if their condition  is treatable digitally . If it is, they get a follow -up 
appointment  with a GP or senior nurse. Clinicians  can arrange lab tests, issue prescription s, 
and make referrals to health facilit ies. 
• OMOMi (Nigeria)  is an app that provides pregnant women and mother s with maternal and 
child health information while connecting them to medical personnel. Its reach is around 40,000 
users. OMOMi (meaning ‘My Child’)  is free to install and generates revenue through a premium 
service on the app called OMOMi Chat -A-Doc. This enables users to pay for 24/7 access to 
online chats with doctors. Payment options include a weekly subscription of 600 Nigerian N aira 
(£1.30) or a monthly subscription of 1,200 Naira (£2.60) . OMOMi is also developing an online 
marketplace where mothers can purchase baby or mother care products from retailers.  
• M-TIBA (Kenya)  is a mobile service that enables users to send, save, and spend funds 
specifically for medical treatment. Users can make contributions on behalf of family, friends, or 
staff, so they can get treatment if needed. Money stored in M -TIBA can only be used to pay for 
treatment and medication at partner clinics and hospitals. Payments are facilitated through M -
Pesa, and funds are managed by UAP Insurance. M -Tiba was set up by a partnership o f a 
health foundation, a mobile operator (Safaricom), and a health finance platform provider. The 
service currently has 4.6 million users and has paid out 844 million Kenyan shillings (£6.5 
million) on 472,000 clinic visits.  
• Docta Ghana (Ghana)  is an app t hat connects people with doctors in Accra. Users can 
request a consultation by entering their health concern, and selecting a doctor and preferred 
time. Users can talk to a doctor or use a video call. The system can also issue prescriptions. 
The consultati on fee is high at around 100 Ghanaian cedi (£15) and can be paid using mobile 
money, or credit, debit or ATM cards.

Introduction  
Nowadays, one of the most important tasks 
for the further development of Uzbekistan is to 
achieve economic digitalization in the country. 
This further development, in turn, requires both 
economic and social measures to carry out within 
the country. That is to say, economic developm ent 
is not only physical changes of nations 
environment but also changes in the way people 
think and behave. Thus during the process of 
digital transformation of market institutions the 
literacy level of the population, to be more 
precisely, increasing the  level of financial literacy 
will be the objective character due to wide range 
of online transactions in the digitalized world.  
In his address, the President of the Republic 
of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev for the first 
time put forward the concept of poverty in 
Uzbekistan [1].  President also said “the greatest 
poverty is the lack of knowledge” . It can also be 
assumed that he  emphasizes the level of financial 
literacy. Previously, the concept of poverty level 
in the country was almost never used.  At o ne of 
the meetings, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev noted 
that 12 -15% of the population of Uzbekistan, or 4 -
5 million people, live in poverty. This means that 
their daily income does not exceed 10 -13 
thousand soums (about 0,95 -1.25 US dollars).  On August 17, 2018, the Board of the 
Central Bank of Uzbekistan decided to join the 
Alliance for Financial Inclusion. The alliance was 
established in 2008 to help member countries 
develop and implement fiscal policy, establish and 
train working groups on topical issues of banking 
services, create a platform for exchange of 
experience, protect consumer rights and finance 
small business.  
In Uzbekistan, only  two methods are used 
to measure poverty. The results of the nutrition -
based method show that the poverty rate is 11. 4%. 
Based on the results of the second approach, the 
poverty rate is 36.6% at $ 5.5 per day and 9.6% at 
$ 3.6. According to the World Bank, by regions of 
Uzbeksitan  high levels of poverty are observed in 
Samarkand, Surkhandarya, Syrdarya, Andijan 
regions an d the Republic of Karakalpakstan [2]. 
In recent years, significant progress has been 
made in creating a publicly accessible database 
that can be used to study poverty levels. They 
allow us to describe poverty, its factors, as well as 
test many hypotheses about the impact of specific 
programs and political reforms on poverty. For 
example, by comparing the characteristics of poor 
and non -poor people or households, it is possible 
to identify the cause of poverty and set clear 
parameters to combat it. In this case, the

Materials and methods  
These results confirm the importance of 
quality of education, employment rate, housing 
opportunities and living conditions in most regions of the country in addressing the problem 
of poverty.  The quality of education can also be 
attributed to financial literacy. The lower the level 
of financial literacy of the population, especially 
the youth, the higher the level of poverty in the 
count ry.
 
Table 1. Indirect factors influencing the measurement of poverty.  
 
Low level of financial literacy is not only 
associated with developing countries but also with 
developed countries so that both of them always 
take actions  to make their population financially 
literate because of unprecedented benefits to both 
individuals and the economy as a whole.  Most 
countries such as USA, Canada, and The United 
Kingdom, along with international organi zations 
like the OECD ( The Organizat ion for Economic 
Co-operation and Development)  are concerned 
with particular measures to improve financial 
literacy level in the countries and have launched 
various programs aimed at tackling problems the 
governments face. For instance, the OECD started 
the International Gateway for Financial Education 
which  focuses to perform as a clearinghouse for 
financial education programs, information and 
research worldwide  [1].There is a national non -
profit organization on financial literacy  - 
the JumpS tart Coalition  for Personal Financial 
Literacy  in the U.S., consists  of corporate, 
academic, non -profit, and government organizations . The mission of this organization is 
to help young people develop lifelong financial 
decision -making skills.  The UK also has a special 
body – the Money Advice Service which develops 
and coordinates national strategies to develop the 
financial capability of the population. The process 
of raising financial literacy in Singapore is slightly 
different from other countries. The country has the 
inaugural Financial Literacy Hub for Teachers 
established by the National Institute of Education 
Singapore and government -funded the Institute for 
Financial Literacy  [2]. The aim of these 
organizations is to provide free and effective 
education -oriented fin ancial programs to the 
population in order to build financial capability in 
the country . 
Improving the level of financial literacy of 
the population is usually carried out by special 
government departments or organizations funded 
by the state. For example,  in the United States, 
this responsibility is vested in the Financial 
Literacy and Education Commission (FLEC). •age,

(FIS), Canada has a Financial Consumer 
Protection Service (FCAC), and the UK has a 
Financial Servi ces Authority (FSA).  
As for the experience of the United States  
in this regard , then they, being a state with the 
largest financial center in the world - New York, 
have a wealth of experience in improving the 
financial literacy of the population.  The Financial 
Literacy and Eduction Commission (FLEC) was 
formed in collaboration with the US Congress. In 
2006, the National Financial Literacy Strategy 
was developed. But do not forget that since 1995 
the ""JumpStart"" Coalition for Individual Financial 
Literacy has been operating in the United States, 
which provides assistance to young people under 
the age of 19 [3].  
In general, in the United States, there is 
almost the same vector of measures to ensure 
financial literacy as in other developed countries:  
- emphasis on an individual approach;  
- creation of telephone lines for financial 
matters;  
- instilling financial skills in children in 
schools.  
But the United States has achieved more 
significant results: financial literacy in the country 
is at a high lev el. Here, children can receive a 
bank card at the age of 10, in most states the 
turnover of cash is minimized, there is a greater 
integration of the population into the financial 
sphere of society. A 2010 study by the 
“Jump Start” Coalition found that only 21 states 
need specific financial education. This is a big 
breakthrough, since in 2008 a significant part of 
the country's young population needed additional 
financial education. In the United States, it is also 
customary to set up so -called financial cent ers at 
universities, where students can obtain the 
information they need for financial transactions 
both during their studies and after graduation.  
China recognizes the leading role of the 
state in raising the level of the financial culture of 
the populati on. However, the PRC currently lacks 
a unified state program aimed at improving 
financial literacy. We can only note the efforts of individual authorities in this area. These include 
the development of the Student Financial Literacy 
Program (CIEFR) [4]. 
This program was developed jointly by the 
Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance 
of China. Its purpose is to disseminate information 
among schoolchildren and students about the 
possibility of obtaining educational loans, as well 
as help those stude nts who have difficulties in 
paying off educational loans. In addition, the 
Ministry of Finance, together with the Ministry of 
Education, established an educational institution 
based at Peking University, which combines the 
functions of a national research  center in the field 
of economics and finance, as well as an 
educational center that develops programs to 
improve financial literacy of the population. This 
allows this educational institution to conduct its 
courses on improving the financial culture of th e 
population in accordance with global trends in this 
area, as well as the main socio -economic goals of 
the country.  
In Brazil , the National Strategy for 
Improving the Quality of Financial Education 
(ENEF) is currently in place at the state level. It 
was developed by the committee for the regulation 
of financial markets, the ministries of education, 
finance, justice, social protection, as well as 
largest banks and credit organizations in the 
country[5].  
When developing the ENEF program, the 
authors took in to account that about 82% of 
citizens of the country did not know the exact 
percentage of their loans, and 87% had no savings 
or had little or no savings. Therefore, the goals 
were to increase the involvement of the population 
in the activities of financia l markets, as well as to 
increase the financial literacy of all segments of 
the population.  
A feature of this program is the coverage of 
a large part of society, and not a specific category 
of citizens. For example, ENEF includes measures 
to improve the fi nancial literacy of students. These 
include: teacher training based on materials and 
curricula developed by the Central Bank of Brazil; 
development of textbooks and multimedia PSYCHOLOGY AND EDUCATION (2021) 58( 1): 86-91             ISSN:00333077

www.psychologyandeducation.net  programs on this topic for different age categories 
of students. The pilot proje ct, launched in 2010, 
reached 30,000 students across the country. This 
project was recognized as successful at the 
government level.     
 As for the possibility of applying these 
measures in Uzbekistan, some of them have rather 
good prospects, which is expl ained by the 
similarity of China and Brazil in terms of the level 
of financial literacy of the population.  
   The importance of financial 
literacy comes from its numerous benefits to the 
population of the country [6].  
When we say about basic financial 
know ledge, it means being aware of the 
followings:  
- Insurance;  
- Credit;  
- Budgeting;  
- Saving;  
- Debt;  
- Interest;  
- Risk and etc.  
Having basic financial knowledge is so 
important for a person to achieve financial 
stability. The individual is able to manage his  or 
her current budget properly, use his /her income 
wisely to meet his current and future needs, and 
make effective financial decisions in the socio -
economic processes throughout life , that is  to say , 
he or she  develops the ability to manage mo ney 
and become accu stomed to control it wisely . In 
short, under the scarce resources in the economy, 
people will learn to use their income to maximize 
their needs by increasing their financial 
knowledge . Unfortunately, in many cases, 
individuals face problems in managing the ir 
available money income (incorrect spending) due 
to lack of sufficient financial skills and 
knowledge [7]. Inefficient decisions in spending 
affects people’s mood, causes a stress andmaybe  
the reason for other help problem s occur.  
Alessandro Antoniette, B orsette Adrea 
describe financial literacy as ""the process by 
which people improve their understanding of 
financial products and concepts and, through information, instruction and advice, develop the 
skills and confidence to become more aware of 
financial r isks and opportunities, to make 
informed choices, to know where to go for help, 
and take other effective actions to improve their 
financial well -being”  [8]. 
Thomas Retzmann and Gunther Seeber 
consider financial literacy as the application of 
skills in dealing with routine money and financial 
matters, such as making a withdrawal or filling 
out a transfer order  [9].  
According to the research results of 
Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia Mitchell, financial 
literacy determines how well people make and 
execute f inancial decisions, including saving, 
investing, borrowing from one's retirement 
account, and planning for retirement [10]. 
Norman King, in his article, defines that 
financial literacy is the  ability to understand 
finance, m ore specifically, it refers to the set of 
skills and knowledge that allow an individual to 
make informed and effective decisions through 
their understanding of finances [11]. 
 
Result and discussion  
Based on world experience, significant 
experience in the development of financial 
educatio n in four regions of Uzbekistan with high 
poverty rates is proposed as following table. It is 
aimed at acquiring the skills of financial literacy 
of more than 1 million people until 2024.  To do 
this, authors proposed to  create a special website 
for financial literacy, on which materials on 
budgeting, savings, the use of bank cards, banking 
services, and debt management are posted; The 
web site also offers a variety of financial games. A 
study of the activities foreseen by this financial 
literacy programs in individual regions will make  
it possible to summarize the main aspects of their 
implementation [table 2] .

So, it can be argued that almost all of the 
above measures are advisable to apply in 
Uzbekistan. At the same time, taking into account 
the peculiarities of activities in this area in 
Uzbekistan, the focus and distribution of priorities 
in each of the areas considered should be slightly 
changed. It is also necessary to know the specifics 
of our economy and financial sphere when writing 
programs, while not forgetting that the ter ritorial, 
cultural and historical traditions of Uzbekistan are 
quite unique.  
 
Conclusion  
Model of proposed financial literacy 
programs in separate regions of Uzbekistan (table 
2) above is the such kind of model which can be 
used in the formation of state p rograms, road 
maps and other concepts aimed at increasing the 
financial literacy of the population.  
Financial literacy of the population is a 
qualitative indicator that ensures that everyone in 
society has sufficient economic knowledge, skills 
and abilitie s, values and the right approach to 
making economic decisions based on them, which 
allows them to ensure their own well -being.  
The level of development of the country's 
economy has a positive impact on the level of 
financial literacy of the population. How ever, this 
does not mean that there are no problems in this 
area in developed countries. Accordingly, 
regardless of the level of development, it is 
important that each country develops regular and 
systematic measures to increase the level of 
financial lite racy of the population, based on the 
characteristics of their economy and population 
mentality.  
The higher the level of financial literacy of 
the population, the higher the level of stability and 
prosperity, first of all, the person, the region in 
which he  lives, and the whole national economy.

Widespread belief in misinformation circulating online is a crit-
ical challenge for modern societies. While research to date has
focused on psychological and political antecedents to this phe-
nomenon, few studies have explored the role of digital media
literacy shortfalls. Using data from preregistered survey exper-
iments conducted around recent elections in the United States
and India, we assess the effectiveness of an intervention modeled
closely on the world’s largest media literacy campaign, which pro-
vided “tips” on how to spot false news to people in 14 countries.
Our results indicate that exposure to this intervention reduced
the perceived accuracy of both mainstream and false news head-
lines, but effects on the latter were signiﬁcantly larger. As a result,
the intervention improved discernment between mainstream and
false news headlines among both a nationally representative sam-
ple in the United States (by 26.5%) and a highly educated online
sample in India (by 17.5%). This increase in discernment remained
measurable several weeks later in the United States (but not in
India). However, we ﬁnd no effects among a representative sam-
ple of respondents in a largely rural area of northern India, where
rates of social media use are far lower.
digital literacyjsocial mediajmisinformation
Social media platforms have proved to be fertile ground for
inﬂammatory political misinformation. People around the
world increasingly worry that so-called “fake news” and other
forms of dubious or false information are misleading voters—a
fear that has inspired government actions to address the problem
in a number of countries (1, 2).
Research into online misinformation has thus far focused on
political, economic, and psychological factors (3–5). In this arti-
cle, we focus on another human vulnerability to online political
misinformation: shortfalls in digital media literacy.
While largely overlooked in the emerging empirical litera-
ture on digital disinformation and fake news, the concept of
digital media literacy usefully captures the skills and competen-
cies needed to successfully navigate a fragmented and complex
information ecosystem (6). Even under ideal conditions, most
people struggle to reliably evaluate the quality of information
they encounter online because they lack the skills and contex-
tual knowledge required to effectively distinguish between high-
and low-quality news content.
The connection between digital media literacy and misinfor-
mation was identiﬁed early by theorists. “Misinformation—and
disinformation—breeds as easily as creativity in the fever-swamp
of personal publishing,” according to an inﬂuential 1997 intro-
duction to the subject. “It will take all of the critical skills users
can muster to separate truth from ﬁction” (ref. 7, p. xii).
More than 20 y later, these warnings seem prescient. Sur-
vey research shows that few people are prepared to effectivelynavigate the digital world. For example, the Pew Research Cen-
ter found as recently as 2017 that only 17% of US adults have
the skills and conﬁdence to learn new information effectively
online (8). Nonetheless, people worldwide increasingly obtain
news and information from social media platforms that lack tra-
ditional editorial controls (9, 10), allowing politicians and other
actors to widely disseminate misinformation via algorithmic news
feeds. Without the necessary digital media literacy skills, people
frequently fall victim to dubious claims they encounter in this
context.
These concerns have become especially salient in the United
States and India in recent years. In the United States, low-
quality online articles were distributed widely on social media in
the months before the 2016 US presidential election (11). This
phenomenon created widespread fears that fake news was mis-
leading people at a massive scale (12). Smartphone use has also
made India, the world’s largest democracy, a fertile environment
for online rumors and misinformation. Viral misinformation
Signiﬁcance
Few people are prepared to effectively navigate the online
information environment. This global deﬁcit in digital media
literacy has been identiﬁed as a critical factor explain-
ing widespread belief in online misinformation, leading to
changes in education policy and the design of technology plat-
forms. However, little rigorous evidence exists documenting
the relationship between digital media literacy and people’s
ability to distinguish between low- and high-quality news
online. This large-scale study evaluates the effectiveness of
a real-world digital media literacy intervention in both the
United States and India. Our largely encouraging results indi-
cate that relatively short, scalable interventions could be
effective in ﬁghting misinformation around the world.

and ethnic violence (13). Moreover, online political misinforma-
tion became a signiﬁcant concern during the 2019 Indian general
election as political parties engaged in aggressive digital cam-
paign efforts via short message service (SMS) and messaging
applications like WhatsApp (14, 15). For instance, one analy-
sis found that over 25% of the news shared on Facebook during
the election by the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came
from dubious outlets (16).
Many nonproﬁts and governments are seeking to counter
these trends (and the related threat of foreign manipulation
campaigns) by improving the digital media literacy of news con-
sumers (17–20). For instance, American universities increasingly
teach media literacy to undergraduate students (21) and similar
efforts are also being proposed at the kindergarten to grade 12
(22). Similarly, WhatsApp and the National Association of Soft-
ware and Service Companies announced plans to train nearly
100,000 people in India through in-person events and posts on
social media to spot misinformation (23).
Despite the attention and resources these initiatives have
received, however, little large-scale evidence exists on the effec-
tiveness of promoting digital media literacy as a response to
online misinformation. Existing scholarly work related to digital
and media literacy is frequently qualitative in nature or focused
on speciﬁc subpopulations and/or issues. Observational ﬁnd-
ings are mixed (24, 25) and randomized controlled trials remain
rare (26).
Two related but more speciﬁc approaches have been shown
to be somewhat effective in countering misinformation and
are important to note, however. First, inoculation interventions
have been employed to protect audiences against misleading
content by warning of misinformation and either correcting spe-
ciﬁc false claims or identifying tactics used to promote it. This
approach has been shown to reduce the persuasiveness of misin-
formation in speciﬁc domains (27–32). In addition, other studies
evaluate the effectiveness of providing warnings about speciﬁc
misinformation (33, 34).
We therefore seek to determine whether efforts to promote
digital media literacy can improve respondents’ ability to cor-
rectly evaluate the accuracy of online content across issues. Such
a ﬁnding would suggest that digital media literacy shortfalls are
a key factor in why people fall victim to misinformation. In par-
ticular, we consider the effects of exposure to Facebook’s “Tips
to Spot False News,” which were developed in collaboration with
the nonproﬁt First Draft and subsequently promoted at the top
of users’ news feeds in 14 countries in April 2017 and printed
in full-page newspaper advertisements in the United States, the
United Kingdom, France, Germany, Mexico, and India (35–40).
A variant of these tips was later distributed by WhatsApp (a
Facebook subsidiary) in advertisements published in Indian and
Pakistani newspapers in 2018 (41, 42). These tips are therefore
almost surely the most widely disseminated digital media lit-
eracy intervention conducted to date. (The full treatments are
provided in SI Appendix, section A.) The US treatment, which
was adapted verbatim from Facebook’s campaign, consists of 10
strategies that readers can use to identify false or misleading
stories that appear on their news feeds, whereas the India treat-
ment, which uses adapted versions of messages shown in India by
Facebook and WhatsApp, presents 6.
These interventions provide simple rules that can help individ-
uals to evaluate the credibility of sources and identify indicators
of problematic content without expending signiﬁcant time or
attention. For instance, one sample tip recommends that respon-
dents “[b]e skeptical of headlines,” warning that “If shocking
claims in the headline sound unbelievable, they probably are.”
Such an approach should reduce reliance on low-effort processes
that frequently lead people astray (e.g., perceptions of cognitive
ﬂuency) by teaching people more effective heuristics (e.g., skep-ticism toward catchy headlines). Importantly, the success of this
approach does not require readers to take burdensome steps like
conducting research or thinking deeply about each piece of news
they encounter (which is typically impossible in practice given
the volume of stories that social media users encounter). Instead,
this intervention aims to provide simple decision rules that help
people distinguish between mainstream and false news, which we
call “discernment” following ref. 4.
There are important reasons to be skeptical about the effec-
tiveness of this approach. Prior research has found that media
literacy interventions like this can help people think critically
about the media content they receive (43). However, prior stud-
ies focus mostly on ofﬂine health behavior; the extent to which
these interventions are effective for controversial political claims
or online (mis)information is largely unknown. Moreover, such
interventions may struggle to overcome people’s reliance on
heuristics such as familiarity and congeniality that news con-
sumers use to evaluate the credibility of online stories (44, 45).
Finally, attempting to identify false news through close scrutiny
of a headline differs from the typical approach of professional
fact checkers, who usually use “lateral reading” of alternative
sources to corroborate claims (46).
We therefore conducted preregistered survey experiments in
both the United States and India examining the effectiveness
of presenting people with “tips” to help spot false news sto-
ries. [The US and India studies were each preregistered with
Evidence in Governance and Politics; see Materials and Meth-
ods. All preregistered analyses are reported in this article or in
the replication archive for the study (47).] Strikingly, our results
indicate that exposure to variants of the Facebook media liter-
acy intervention reduces people’s belief in false headlines. These
effects are not only an artifact of greater skepticism toward all
information—although the perceived accuracy of mainstream
news headlines slightly decreased, exposure to the intervention
widened the gap in perceived accuracy between mainstream and
false news headlines overall. In the United States, the effects
of the treatment were particularly strong and remained statis-
tically measurable after a delay of approximately 3 wk. These
ﬁndings suggest that efforts to promote digital media literacy can
improve people’s ability to distinguish between false and main-
stream news content, a result with important implications for
both scientiﬁc research into why people believe misinformation
online and policies designed to address the problem.
Our main research hypotheses evaluate whether the media
literacy intervention reduces belief in false news stories (hypoth-
esis 1 [H1]), increases belief in mainstream news content (H2),
and improves respondents’ ability to distinguish between them
(H3). We also consider three research questions (RQs) for which
our a priori expectations were less clear. First, past research
shows that the effects of many experimental treatments (e.g., in
persuasion and framing studies) decay quickly over time (48),
although providing participants with novel information may have
more long-lasting effects (49). We therefore test the durability
of our treatment effect by leveraging a two-wave panel design
to tests its effects several weeks after the initial intervention
(RQ1). Second, it is also possible that interventions may work
only to make individuals more skeptical of noncongenial content
they are already inclined to dismiss, leaving their vulnerability
to ideologically consistent misinformation unchanged. We there-
fore test for the heterogeneity of the treatment effects based
on the partisan congeniality of the content (RQ2). Finally, we
test whether the intervention changed self-reported intentions
to share false stories or subsequent online news consumption
behavior in the US sample where these measures were available
(RQ3). Additional analyses exploring heterogenous treatment
effects and alternate outcomes are discussed below, but full mod-
els appear in SI Appendix, section C. These analyses include
whether intuitive cognitive style or prior headline exposure

SCIENCESmoderates the treatment effect, as well as whether the treatment
affects the perceived credibility of “hyperpartisan” headlines.
Results
US Survey Experiment. Consistent with our ﬁrst hypothesis (H1),
randomized exposure to the media literacy intervention causes a
decrease in the perceived accuracy of false news articles. Results
from wave 1 of the US study in Table 1 show a decrease of nearly
0.2 points on a 4-point scale (intent to treat [ITT]: = 0:196,
SE= 0:020; P<0:005). We observe similar effects of the media
literacy intervention on the perceived accuracy of hyperpar-
tisan headlines (ITT: = 0:176, SE = 0:020; P<0:005) (SI
Appendix, section C, Table C2).
One concern is that the intent-to-treat effects described above
understate the true effect of the intervention, which may have
been neglected by some respondents. While we can offer the
opportunity to read the digital literacy “fake news tips” interven-
tion to a random subset of respondents, we cannot force every
respondent to read these tips carefully.
We therefore also estimate the effect of the treatment on those
who actually received it, which is known as the average treatment
effect on the treated (ATT), using an instrumental variables
approach. In this model, our indicator for receipt of treatment
is the ability to correctly answer a series of follow-up questions
about the content of the news tips (approximately two-thirds of
respondents in the treatment condition [66%] were successfully
treated) and our instrument is the original random assignment.
Table 1 reports the ATT, which we compute using two-stage
least-squares regression. With this approach, we estimate that
the perceived accuracy of false headlines decreased by nearly
0.3 points on a 4-point scale (ATT: = 0:299, SE = 0:030;
P<0:005).y
We compare the characteristics of respondents who would suc-
cessfully take the treatment only if assigned to it (“compliers”)
to those who would not even if assigned to treatment (“never tak-
ers”) (SI Appendix, section B) (50). Compliers were more likely
to be older, college graduates, interested in politics, politically
knowledgeable, Republican identiﬁers, and more polarized in
their feelings toward the two political parties than never tak-
ers. Compliers also scored lower in conspiracy predispositions
and their feelings toward Donald Trump. However, the sub-
stantive magnitudes of most of these differences are modest (SI
Appendix, section B, Fig. B1). Crucially, we ﬁnd no statistically
signiﬁcant evidence that respondents who take the treatment dif-
fer in their baseline propensity to visit untrustworthy websites
compared to those who do not (analysis conducted among par-
ticipants for whom presurvey behavioral data are available; see
SI Appendix , section A for details). The average number of prior
visits to false news websites is actually greater among compliers
than among never takers but this difference does not reach con-
ventional thresholds of statistical signiﬁcance (0.35 compared to
0.18; P= 0:08).
Our next hypotheses predicted that the media literacy inter-
vention would increase the perceived accuracy of mainstream
news (H2) and increase people’s ability to successfully distin-
guish between mainstream and false news articles (H3). These
results are shown in the second and third columns in Table 1.
We ﬁnd that exposure to the media literacy intervention had
a small negative effect on belief in mainstream news in wave
1 (ITT,= 0:046 [SE= 0:017], P<0:01; ATT, = 0:071
[SE= 0:026], P<0:01). However, the negative effects of the
†These results were not preregistered but were estimated to match the preregistered
compliance analyses reported in the India study. We also provide additional exploratory
results that instead deﬁne compliance as answering each comprehension question cor-
rectly by the third try in SI Appendix, section C, Table C7. Our ATT effect estimates are
necessarily smaller using this less stringent deﬁnition of treatment uptake.Table 1. Effect of US media literacy intervention on perceived

intervention on the perceived accuracy of false news described
above are larger. As a result, the media literacy intervention
increased discernment between mainstream and false stories
(ITT,= 0:146 [SE= 0:024], P<0:005; ATT, = 0:223 [SE=
0:035], P<0:005), demonstrating that it helped respondents to
better distinguish between these two types of content. In relative
terms, this effect represents a 26.5% improvement in respon-
dents’ ability to distinguish between mainstream and false news
stories compared to the control condition.
In addition, we test the durability of these treatment effects
in wave 2 per RQ1. After a delay between waves that aver-
aged several weeks, the effect of the media literacy inter-
vention on the perceived accuracy of false headlines remains
statistically distinguishable from zero (SI Appendix, section C,
Table C1). The median interval between waves was 20 d; the
5th to95th percentile range was 16 to 29 d. While the effect
is still present weeks later, its magnitude attenuates by more
than half relative to wave 1 (ITT, = 0:080 [SE= 0:019],
P<0:005; ATT, = 0:121 [SE= 0:028], P<0:005). In addi-
tion, the negative effect of the media literacy treatment on
the perceived accuracy of mainstream news content was no
longer statistically measurable by wave 2. As a result, the
perceived accuracy difference between mainstream and false
headlines remained statistically distinguishable from zero in the
second wave, although its magnitude decayed ( = 0:050; SE =
0:020; P<0:05).
Fig. 1 illustrates the substantive magnitude of the intent to
treat effects of the media literacy intervention in the United
States using a binary indicator of perceived headline accuracy.
The proportion of respondents rating a false headline as “very
accurate” or “somewhat accurate” decreased from 32% in the
control condition to 24% among respondents who were assigned
to the media literacy intervention in wave 1, a decrease of 7
percentage points. This effect represents a relative decrease of

approximately one-fourth in the percentage of people wrongly
endorsing misinformation. Treatment effects continue to persist
with this alternate measure—in wave 2, the intervention reduced
the proportion of people endorsing false headlines as accurate
from 33 to 29%, a 4-percentage-point effect. By contrast, the pro-
portion of respondents who classiﬁed mainstream news as not
very accurate or not at all accurate rather than somewhat or very
accurate decreased only from 57 to 55% in wave 1 and 59 to 57%
in wave 2.
Finally, RQ2 explores whether the effects of the media literacy
intervention are moderated by the partisan congeniality of the
headlines people rated. We ﬁnd no consistent evidence that the
effects of media literacy intervention are moderated by conge-
niality (SI Appendix, section C). In other words, the effects of the
intervention were not differentially concentrated among head-
lines that were uncongenial to respondents—an encouraging null
result that echoes ﬁndings in recent studies (34, 51, 52).
Additional results reported in SI Appendix, section C indi-
cate that we have insufﬁcient evidence to conclude that the
intervention had an effect on self-reported intention to share
false news or behavioral measures of news consumption (SI
Appendix, section C, Table C13). However, the intervention did
signiﬁcantly increase sharing intentions for mainstream news and
decrease sharing intentions for hyperpartisan news. This is con-
sistent with previous studies that have reported mixed effects of
warning labels on sharing intent (33, 34). The mixed results we
observe for sharing intent may be attributable to the fact that
belief accuracy questions appeared immediately before the shar-
ing intent questions in the survey, which may prime accuracy
concerns among respondents and thereby alter both real and
self-reported sharing behavior. In addition, we ﬁnd no measur-
able effect of the intervention on posttreatment visits to false
news, mainstream news, or fact-checking sites, although these
effects can be estimated only among the subset of respondents
for whom we have behavioral data (SI Appendix, section C,
Tables C14–15).
India Survey Experiments. As detailed in Materials and Methods,
we conducted separate online and face-to-face surveys in India of
different populations. For the online sample, we again ﬁnd sup-
port for H1. The media literacy treatment signiﬁcantly reduced
beliefs in false news stories (ITT: = 0:126, SE = 0.026;
P<0:005) in the ﬁrst wave of a two-wave survey (Table 2).
As with the US analysis, the ATT estimate was substantiallylarger (Table 2), although the difference between the ITT and
the ATT is larger for the Indian analysis because fewer respon-
dents answered all comprehension checks correctly in the Indian
sample (28% in the online sample versus 66% in the United
States).zRespondents to the online survey who received the
treatment were nearly half of a response category more skeptical
of false news stories (ATT: = 0:470, SE = 0.097; P<0:005).
As in the United States, we also ﬁnd no support for H2,
which predicted that exposure to the treatment would increase
the perceived accuracy of mainstream news. Instead, the per-
ceived accuracy of mainstream news decreased, although by less
than the effect observed for false news (ITT, = 0:071[SE =
0.025], P<0:01; ATT, = 0:259 [SE = 0.095], P<0:01).
Results again mirror the US study for H3—respondents bet-
ter distinguished between mainstream and false articles (ITT,
= 0:063 [SE = 0.025], P<0:05; ATT,= 0:221 [SE = 0.088],
P<0:05).§While the magnitude of this effect is lower than for
the US sample, it translates to a 17.3% improvement in dis-
cernment between mainstream and false news relative to the
difference observed in the control condition. As we discuss in
more detail below, treatment effects cannot be distinguished
from zero in the second wave (RQ1).
While the analyses of the online samples from the United
States and India show substantially similar results, results from
the face-to-face survey in India differ in important ways. As
shown in Table 2, we ﬁnd no evidence that the treatment
increased the perceived accuracy of mainstream news articles
as predicted by H2. However, it did not reduce the perceived
accuracy of these headlines either as we found in the United
States and online studies. In addition, unlike the other studies,
we ﬁnd no evidence that the media literacy treatment system-
atically affected beliefs in false news stories (H1) or discrimi-
nation between false and mainstream news (H3) among India
face-to-face respondents.
‡The analysis of compliers is presented in SI Appendix, section B. As SI Appendix, Fig. B2
shows, compliers in the India online sample (those who would take the treatment if
assigned) were more likely to be young, male, Hindu, and high caste; to have graduated
from college; to use WhatsApp; and to have more political knowledge and interest than
never takers (respondents who would not take the treatment if assigned to receive it).
We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences between these groups in the face-to-face sample (SI
Appendix, section B, Fig. B3).
§In an exploratory analysis, we show that the result is robust to using an indicator for
false news headlines instead of headline ﬁxed effects (SI Appendix, section D, Table D3).

We directly assess the difference between the two samples
using a pooled model. These results, presented in SI Appendix,
section D, Table D13, indicate that we can reject the null of
no difference in media literacy intervention effects between
the face-to-face and online samples for ratings of false news

(ITT,= 0:057 [SE = 0.039], P>0:05; ATT,= 0:194 [SE
= 0.163], P>0:05). Potentially, the differences in our results
between studies may reﬂect the different survey modes or demo-
graphic compositions of the samples (we consider this issue
further in Discussion).
Fig. 2 illustrates the substantive magnitudes of the ITT effect
for respondents to the two India surveys. For the online survey,
exposure to the media literacy intervention reduced the percent-
age of respondents rating false headlines as somewhat accurate
or very accurate from 49% in the control group to 44% in the
treatment group, a decrease of approximately 10% in relative
terms. As noted above, the effect of the intervention was much
greater for those who received the treatment successfully—the
ATT estimate indicates a decline of approximately 19 percent-
age points in endorsement of false headlines among this group
(SI Appendix, section D, Table D7). By contrast, although main-
stream stories were also viewed more skeptically by online survey
respondents who received the media literacy intervention (from
63% for controls to 60% in the treatment group), the rela-
tive decrease in perceived accuracy was only half of what was
observed for false headlines. Finally, as noted above, there was
no signiﬁcant difference on average between face-to-face survey
respondents who received the media literacy treatment and those
who did not for either false or mainstream headlines (belief lev-
els were higher overall among face-to-face respondents—62%
for false headlines and 72% for mainstream headlines).
A key research question was whether any treatment effects
would persist over time (RQ1). We found no statistically reliableevidence that the treatment affected headline accuracy ratings
among wave 2 respondents in either India sample (SI Appendix,
section D, Table D2).¶Finally, we did not ﬁnd statistically reli-
able evidence in either India survey that the media literacy
intervention’s effects were moderated by partisan congeniality
(RQ2; SI Appendix, section D, Table D9). We cannot conclude
that the effects we observe depend on whether the headlines
were congenial to respondent partisanship.
Discussion
Comparing our results across studies reveals a relatively con-
sistent pattern. As Fig. 3 indicates, both the US study and the
India online study ﬁnd negative effects on the perceived accu-
racy of false headlines that are diminished for mainstream news
headlines. As a result, respondents’ ability to discern between
mainstream and false news increased. Although these ﬁndings
are not observed in the India face-to-face study, a combined
estimate pooling data from all three studies replicates the over-
all pattern of reduced false news accuracy perceptions and
increased discernment between mainstream and false news. The
treatment effect estimates for each study as well as the pooled
results are shown in Fig. 3 (see SI Appendix, section F for full
model results).
These effects are also substantively meaningful. Although our
study does not instruct respondents to apply the lessons from
the intervention to the headline ratings task, the effect sizes are
comparable to the estimated effect of exposure to the labels
Facebook initially used to indicate that articles were disputed
by fact checkers (ITT estimate: = 0:236, SE = 0:036; P<
0:005) (34) and greatly exceed the effects of a general warning
about false news in the same study (ITT estimate: = 0:079,
SE= 0:034; P<0:05). A comparison of effect sizes with other
¶The median intervals between waves were 20 d for the face-to-face survey and 19 d
in the online survey; the 5th to 95th percentile ranges were 14 to 29 d and 15 to 26 d,
respectively. The wave 2 results are substantively unchanged if we include the four addi-
tional false headlines from the fact-check message experiment described in SI Appendix,
section A (SI Appendix, section D, Table D10).

randomized media literacy interventions in SI Appendix, section
E, Table E1 shows that our US study has the largest measured
effect size to date on ratings of false headlines (d = 0:20) and
that the India online study (d = 0:11) falls in the upper middle of
the distribution. Moreover, effect sizes are substantially larger
for respondents who were successfully treated with the media
literacy intervention.
Despite the strength of the combined estimates, the effec-
tiveness of the intervention varied across samples. First, the
intervention may have been more unfamiliar or difﬁcult to
understand for Indian respondents, who successfully received
the treatment at a much lower rate than those in the United
States. Additional evidence suggests that respondents may have
applied the intervention differently. Speciﬁcally, the US data
show that the negative effects of the media literacy interven-
tion on perceived headline accuracy were greater for headlines
from untrustworthy, hyperpartisan, and unfamiliar mainstream
sources that respondents in the control group found less plausi-
ble to begin with (r = 0:79;SI Appendix, section C, Table C11
and Fig. C2). This ﬁnding helps explain the observed nega-
tive effect of the media literacy intervention on the perceived
accuracy of mainstream news overall.#By contrast, no such
relationship between baseline headline accuracy and media lit-
eracy intervention effects is observed in the Indian online data
(r= 0:09; SI Appendix, section D8), suggesting respondents
became more skeptical across the board.
Problems applying the intervention may have been particularly
acute for respondents in the face-to-face sample. This group is
quite dissimilar from both the highly educated online sample
in India and the US sample on a number of important indi-
cators (SI Appendix, section B). In particular, participants in
the face-to-face study had much less experience with the task
of evaluating news headlines online—only 11% reported using
WhatsApp compared with 90% for the online sample in India.
Correspondingly, an exploratory analysis shows the effects of the
intervention were similar among WhatsApp users across sam-
ples; however, these effects are imprecisely estimated among
#An exploratory analysis of whether source prominence moderates the effects of
the media literacy intervention shows that the negative effects we observe for the
perceived accuracy of mainstream news headlines were concentrated among stories
from low-prominence sources. By contrast, we ﬁnd that the intervention appeared to
increase the perceived accuracy of stories from high-prominence sources (SI Appendix,
section C9).face-to-face participants because WhatsApp use was so rare (SI
Appendix, section D9).
Finally, we consider the potential trade-off between increased
skepticism toward false news headlines and decreased belief
in mainstream news headlines. Our results do indicate that
increased skepticism of false news headlines may come at the
expense of decreased belief in mainstream news headlines—the
media literacy intervention reduced the perceived accuracy of
these headlines in both the US and India online surveys. How-
ever, the magnitude of the decrease in the perceived accuracy
of mainstream news headlines ranges from under 25% (United
States) to just over half (India online sample) of the estimated
size of the decrease in the perceived accuracy of untrustworthy
news headlines in wave 1 of our surveys. As a result, respondents’
overall ability to distinguish between mainstream and untrust-
worthy news increases by more than 26% in the US sample and
17% in the highly educated online Indian sample. Moreover, we
observe no measurable decrease in the perceived accuracy of
mainstream news headlines in wave 2 of any of our surveys.
A related concern is that the intervention could reduce the
overall accuracy of people’s beliefs given that they typically con-
sume much more information from mainstream sources than
from untrustworthy ones (53). To address this concern, we use
US Pulse web metering data to estimate the overall change that
the intervention would hypothetically induce in people’s ability
to accurately discern credible news given exposure rates for US
participants to different types of news sources (see SI Appendix,
section G for details). Because Americans’ news consumption
is concentrated among the high-prominence mainstream out-
lets for which the intervention may have had a small positive
effect#, these calculations indicate that individuals would reach
valid accuracy beliefs for 64.6% of stories in the treatment group
compared to 62.9% in the control group. Moreover, the percent-
age of “false positives”—stories they encounter from dubious
sources and believe to be true—would decrease from 6.1%
of all stories consumed in the control group to 4.9% in the
treatment group.
Conclusion
The ﬁndings we present provide important evidence that short-
falls in digital media literacy are an important factor in why
people believe misinformation that they encounter online. We
ﬁnd that a simple, scalable media literacy intervention can
decrease the perceived accuracy of false news content and help

people to better distinguish it from factual mainstream news in
both the United States and India. Moreover, the improvement
in headline accuracy rating performance we observe does not
depend on whether the claims in question align with respondents’
political predispositions.
Our results further suggest that media literacy campaigns
could be an effective strategy to help counter false or mislead-
ing news, a ﬁnding with important real-world implications. Some
explanations for belief in misinformation identify factors that
resist intervention (4), while others propose policy approaches
that are effective in practice but difﬁcult to scale (34, 44). Inoc-
ulation, while effective in preemptively refuting misinformation
in speciﬁc domains (27–30), may not improve discernment when
evaluating a diverse array of real-world news content. By con-
trast, these results show that a brief intervention which could be
inexpensively disseminated at scale can be effective at reducing
the perceived accuracy of false news stories, helping users more
accurately gauge the credibility of news content they encounter
on different topics or issues.
Although these results suggest that digital literacy interven-
tions could be a valuable tool in the ﬁght against misinformation,
several caveats should be offered. First, the effect sizes weremodest; this simple intervention did not eliminate belief in false
news headlines. Second, the effects decayed over time (diminish-
ing in magnitude in the United States and no longer remaining
statistically measurable in the India online study), suggesting the
need for social media companies, journalists, and educators to
reinforce these lessons on a recurring basis. Third, although the
intervention improved overall discernment between mainstream
and false news headlines, it did have a small but measurable
negative effect on the perceived accuracy of mainstream news
stories. Fourth, all treated participants were exposed to the
intervention; many real-world Facebook users are likely to have
ignored the Tips to Spot False News link when the company
offered it in their feeds. (The difference between our ITT and
ATT estimates illustrates how lack of attention to the treat-
ment reduces its effectiveness.) Finally, we have insufﬁcient
evidence to conclude that the intervention changed real-world
consumption of false news, perhaps because information habits
are ingrained and difﬁcult to alter. However, we do ﬁnd evidence
that the treatment increased respondents’ intent to share main-
stream news and decreased intent to share hyperpartisan news,
suggesting the possibility of changes to social media behavior.
Our ﬁndings also suggest a number of directions for future
research. One advantage of the study is that we used an actual
intervention deployed globally by a technology company that
has served as an important access point to false news (53).
However, scholars should conduct comparative evaluations of
the effects of different interventions rather than relying on this
model as a default and test the effectiveness of these approaches
in different samples, countries, and electoral contexts. These
evaluations should include tests of more intensive digital literacy
training models (such as the “lateral reading” approach used by
professional fact checkers), which could potentially have larger
and/or more durable effects. In addition, scholars should seek to
better understand the mechanism through which such interven-
tions operate, identifying whether the effects they observe are
due to increased accuracy concerns versus helping people learn
more effective heuristics for evaluating news content. Finally,
researchers should further examine whether and how media lit-
eracy interventions can increase the frequency or effectiveness
of accuracy-promoting behavior in social contexts. Even if these
interventions do not reach everyone, improving the media lit-
eracy of a subset of the population could yield wider positive
effects if, for instance, those who are treated help to correct the
misinformation they see on social media (54).
To our knowledge, though, these ﬁndings are the most com-
pelling demonstration to date that a real-world digital literacy
intervention can have signiﬁcant and potentially lasting effects.
While efforts to improve online digital literacy are not a panacea,
they may prove to be a vital and cost-effective way to reduce
people’s vulnerability to false news and thereby improve the
information health of democracies.
Materials and Methods
Data Collection. We conducted two-wave panel surveys of respondents that
included an embedded media literacy intervention. One survey took place
in the United States and two were conducted in India. All took place dur-
ing periods of high political interest during and immediately after national
electoral campaigns.
In the United States, we conducted a two-wave online panel sur-
vey ﬁelded by the survey company YouGov shortly after the 2018 US
midterm elections (wave 1, November 20 to December 27, 2018, N=4, 907;
wave 2, December 14, 2018 to January 3, 2019, N=4, 283).kRespondents
were selected by YouGov’s matching and weighting algorithm to approxi-
mate the demographic and political attributes of the US population (32%
kRespondents took the surveys in order with a delay between them averaging approx-
imately 3 wk. The dates above reﬂect the ranges in which all wave 1 and wave 2
responses were collected.
Guess et al. PNAS Latest Articles j7 of 10Downloaded by guest on June 25, 2020 college graduates, 45% male, median age 50 y; 46% identify as Democrats
and 36% as Republicans). A subset of these respondents were members of
the YouGov Pulse panel and voluntarily provided behavioral data on their
online information consumption as well (see SI Appendix, section A for more
details).
US data collection was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)
at the University of Michigan (HUM00153414), Washington University in St.
Louis (201806142), and Princeton University (10875). University of Exeter
accepted the University of Michigan IRB approval. All subjects gave con-
sent to participate in our study. The US study preanalysis plan is available at
https://osf.io/u3sgc.
For India, we conducted two separate two-wave panel studies, one online
and the other face to face. Both surveys were conducted in Hindi. Respon-
dents were excluded if indicated they mostly or always give humorous
or insincere answers to survey questions (which amounted to 7–8% of
responses in the online survey by wave compared to less than 1% in the
face-to-face survey; this exclusion represents a deviation from our preregis-
tration, but the results in Table 2 are robust to including these respondents).
In the online survey, we collected survey data from a national convenience
sample of Hindi-speaking Indians recruited via Mechanical Turk and the
Internet Research Bureau’s Online Bureau survey panels (wave 1, April 17 to
May 1, 2019, N=3, 273; wave 2, May 13 to 19, 2019, N=1, 369). The India
face-to-face survey was conducted by the polling ﬁrm Morsel in Barabanki,
Bahraich, Domariyaganj, and Shrawasti, four parliamentary constituencies
in the state of Uttar Pradesh where Hindi is the dominant language (wave
1, April 13 to May 2, 2019, N=3, 744; wave 2, May 7 to 19, 2019, N=2,695).
These locations were chosen, in part, due to their higher levels of religious
polarization, which we anticipated might increase demand for and belief in
online misinformation and rumors. The representative random sample for
the India face-to-face survey was drawn from the public voter registration
list for these constituencies and was administered orally by trained enumer-
ators to account for low literacy rates. Relative to the face-to-face survey,
online respondents were more likely to be male (72% versus 64%), younger
(median age 30 y versus 37 y), more educated (76% college graduates ver-
sus 6%), higher caste (42% low caste versus 74% in the face-to-face sample),
more active on social media (90% use WhatsApp versus 11%), more inter-
ested in politics (3.7 versus 2.9 on a 4-point scale), more knowledgeable
about politics (providing correct responses to an average of 2.8 vs. 2.1 of
four true–false questions about Indian politics), and slightly less likely to
support the BJP (42% versus 46%) (SI Appendix, section D, Table D1).
India data collection was approved by the IRBs at the University of
Michigan (HUM00160358), Ashoka University, and Morsel Research and
Development (HIRB000007598). University of Exeter accepted the Univer-
sity of Michigan IRB approval. All subjects gave consent to participate in our
study. The India study preanalysis plan is available at https://osf.io/97rnz.
Our study contexts can be viewed as a most-different case comparison
among democracies (55). India and the United States are broadly consid-
ered the poorest and richest countries, respectively, in terms of income per
capita among longstanding large democracies (ref. 56, p. 42). As a result,
India is likely to have lower levels of education and media literacy than
the United States, which raises questions about the efﬁcacy of any media
intervention. The two studies we conduct within India further reﬁne this
comparison, allowing us to evaluate the effects of the media literacy inter-
vention among both an online sample that has demographics that are more
similar to the United States and a face-to-face sample in one of the poorest
regions in India. Our study can thus provide evidence about the efﬁcacy of
a media literacy intervention across democratic contexts that differ in levels
of income, education, and digital media use.
News Headline Rating Task. The main outcome of interest in all three sur-
veys was the perceived accuracy of mainstream and false news headlines. To
construct this measure, we asked respondents to evaluate the accuracy of
a number of headlines on a 4-point scale ranging from very accurate (4) to
not at all accurate (1). All of the headlines were published by actual news
sources or circulated on Facebook or WhatsApp within 6 mo of the respec-
tive survey, and a portion of the headlines were rated as false by at least
one third-party fact-checking organization. The order of the headlines was
randomized within wave for each respondent. All headlines are shown in SI
Appendix, section H1.
In the US survey, respondents evaluated 16 different headlines that
varied across multiple dimensions: news type (mainstream versus hyper-
partisan versus false), valence (pro-Democrat versus pro-Republican), and
prominence among mainstream sources (high versus low). We deﬁne high-
prominence mainstream sources as those that more than 4 in 10 Americans
recognize in Pew polling (57). Hyperpartisan stories are those that are tech-nically factual but present slanted facts in a deceptive manner. We selected
these stories from hyperpartisan sources identiﬁed in prior work (58) (SI
Appendix, section H). This process resulted in 8 mainstream, 4 false, and
4 hyperpartisan headlines. In wave 1, respondents were shown 8 headlines
(a randomly selected headline from the two available for each possible com-
bination of news type, valence, and source prominence), while respondents
in wave 2 were shown all 16 headlines. Headlines were presented as they
would appear on the Facebook news feed to replicate a typical decision
environment. Speciﬁcally, respondents were shown the article previews that
are automatically generated by Facebook when a link is entered into the
news feed that featured a headline, a photo, the news source’s web domain,
and in certain cases a byline or story text snippet. Respondents were asked
to rate the accuracy of each headline.
In the India surveys, we adopted the same approach in asking respon-
dents to evaluate the accuracy of headlines that varied across several
dimensions: valence (congenial to BJP supporters versus congenial to BJP
opponents) and accuracy (true articles from mainstream sources††versus
false articles as identiﬁed by fact checkers). Nationalism is also commonly
linked to misinformation in India (59). The issue was particularly salient
when the India surveys were conducted (a time of escalating tensions
between India and Pakistan), so we also asked respondents to rate the
accuracy of true and false headlines relevant to nationalist concerns in
the country (either India–Pakistan or Hindu–Muslim relations). Unlike the
US study (where the same headlines were used in both waves 1 and 2
to test for prior exposure effects), we used different sets of headlines in
each wave. Finally, 4 additional false headlines were included in the second
wave based on fact checks conducted between the two waves.zzIn total,
respondents rated 12 headlines in wave 1 (6 false and 6 true) and 16 in
wave 2 (10 false and 6 true). Respondents were presented with the headline
in text format in the online survey, while enumerators read the headlines
to respondents in the face-to-face survey. In both cases, participants were
asked to evaluate the accuracy of all headlines they were presented in
each wave.
Analysis. Our primary analyses are pooled OLS models predicting percep-
tions of headline accuracy on a four-point scale that ranges from not at
all accurate to very accurate. These models were estimated at the headline
level with ﬁxed effects for each headline. Although we attempted to choose
stories that were balanced in their face validity, the headlines differed in
plausibility because the actual stories were not constructed by researchers.
We therefore use the ﬁxed effects to account for baseline differences in
perceived accuracy between headlines. Because respondents rated multi-
ple headlines, we also compute cluster-robust standard errors. In addition
to the pooled OLS models, we also examine the difference in accuracy
beliefs between mainstream and false headlines at the respondent level
by calculating a respondent-level measure of the difference in mean lev-
els of perceived accuracy between mainstream and false headlines. Higher
scores on this scale indicate better ability to discern between stories of
different types.
Congeniality is a binary variable that is coded at the headline level for
partisans to indicate whether a story is consistent with a respondent’s par-
tisan leanings (e.g., a Democrat evaluating a story that is favorable to a
Democrat would take the value of 1). Uncongenial is coded as the opposite.
The baseline category is reserved for headline ratings by pure nonparti-
sans. To determine the partisanship of respondents in the US survey, we
used the standard two-question party identiﬁcation battery (which includes
leaners) to classify respondents as Democrats or Republicans. Because India
has a multiparty system, we classiﬁed respondents there as BJP supporters if
they reported liking the BJP more than any other party (on a four-point
scale) and as a BJP opponent if they liked any other party more than
the BJP.
The key explanatory variable of interest is exposure to the media lit-
eracy intervention, which was adapted from an intervention deployed by
Facebook and WhatsApp around the world, including in Hindi-language
newspapers in India (see SI Appendix, section A for details and the exact
text). We randomly assigned respondents in wave 1 of the US and India
studies with probability 0.5 to be exposed to a set of tips for distinguishing
false news stories from mainstream stories. In the US survey experiment, 10
††Mainstream news sources included ZeeNews, Washington Post, National Herald India,
IndiaToday, Nikkei Asian Review, Reuters, and Bloomberg.
‡‡These additional headlines were part of a parallel study; further details are provided
inSI Appendix, section A).

SCIENCEStips published by Facebook were presented verbatim in 2 groups of 3 and
one group of 4. In the India surveys, 6 tips from those published by Face-
book and WhatsApp were presented in 2 groups of 3 after being adapted
for the face-to-face format (omitting cues such as URLs that would not
be present and reducing their length when possible). The treatment was
administered before the headline rating task and respondents were asked
comprehension questions after each group of tips to determine receipt of
treatment. We calculate both ITT estimates using the full sample and the
ATT below.
For calculating the ATT, receipt of treatment is deﬁned as answering all
comprehension questions correctly on the ﬁrst try (online participants had
up to three chances to answer correctly; face-to-face respondents had one
chance). Receipt of treatment was substantially higher in the United States
(66% in the US online survey and 24% and 28%, respectively, in the India
face-to-face and online surveys). Our ATT estimates likely understate effects
for two reasons. A small fraction of respondents may be misclassiﬁed as com-
pliers because they guessed correctly on all of the comprehension checks,
which will diminish our ATT estimates relative to the true effect (although
the likelihood of such an outcome under random guessing is low relative to
the estimated compliance rates). Additionally, some respondents we classify
as receiving treatment are effectively “always takers”—people who either
saw the tips in real life or have already internalized them through frequentexperience. The intervention should have no effect on them. As such, our
ATT estimates will understate the true effect.

Although South Africa possesses a progressive legislative framework for service delivery, when it 
comes to implementation at the local level, the reality is different (Tissington et al. 2008). Especially 
disconcerting is the lack of services in predominantly poor communities, rural areas and informal 
settlements of South Africa (Algotsson et al. 2009). Service distribution inequalities emanated 
from the past; apartheid legacy have left high levels of imbalance in access to resources, 
infrastructure and social services (Nnadozie 2013; Tissington et al. 2008). A lack of service delivery 
in these areas infringes on the rights of vulnerable citizens to basic services, such as clean water, 
sanitation, electricity and housing . Particularly pertinent to service delivery in South Africa is the 
need to institute effective and efficient channels of communication between multi-stakeholder 
groups involved and affected by service provision processes. It is essential that local government 
engages in two-way interaction, giving citizens a stake in decision-making with the objective of 
improving service delivery outcomes, especially in marginalised contexts. Engagement is vital in 
policy-making as it informs people of public issues, drives citizens towards a common ground 
that can break legislative deadlocks and increases the accountability of elected officials. Citizens 
in vulnerable contexts are often unaware of their rights, nor do they have the capacity to effectively 
engage with government.
Citizen engagement is widely promoted as a ‘game changer’ for development (Gaventa & Barrett 
2012), as the voiceless become empowered to evoke change in society. Building citizen engagement 
should be examined by identifying ways to increase participation, such as showing results from 
engagement, designing multiple channels of participation, providing multitiered levels of 
engagement, reinforcing a sense of civic duty and collectiveness and getting precommitment from 
citizens (Spada et al. 2015). The concept of citizen engagement and citizen participation is universal 
and fundamental to supporting accountability and transparency of government service delivery; 
however, each global context differs in terms of the effectiveness to deliver and voice the needs of 
citizens and vulnerable groups. Citizen engagement is not a straightforward process, especially in 
resource-constrained contexts where citizens have not had the capacity and knowledge of their Basic service delivery is a fundamental right for all South Africans, especially vulnerable 
groups. Effective and efficient channels of communication between multi-stakeholder groups 
involved and affected by service delivery are essential. Digital citizen engagement has recently 
emerged as a key approach for supporting two-way communication between citizens and the 
government. It is essential for building evidence-based data to engage with government and 
apply social accountability measures to lobby for the provision of basic services. Key to 
building capacities and learning, is developing the abilities of both local government and 
citizens to become digitally literate (including civic and responsiveness literacy), in order to 
realise and action the true benefits of digital citizen engagement. This research set out to 
identify the roles of digital literacy in digital citizen engagement, and how it may be embedded 
in knowledge transfer processes for implementing digital citizen engagement initiatives. A 
pragmatist philosophical approach was applied: studying, observing and reflecting on actions 
in the MobiSAM case study. Using Szulanski’s four-stage model of knowledge transfer, key 
focus areas for developing digital literacy were identified, contributing to a Quadruple-E 
process of: (1) explore, (2) enable, (3) engage and (4) embed. Practices identified in the 
MobiSAM case study are provided as suggestions for each phase, with an indication of possible 
constraints that may be experienced in the knowledge transfer and digital literacy development 
process – a potential guideline for developing digital literacy in digital citizen engagement 
initiatives. The process for knowledge transfer and developing digital literacy that was 
identified in this article provides a guideline for future implementation of digital citizen 
engagement initiatives in resource-constrained contexts.Embedding knowledge transfer in digital citizen

rights to hold government accountable. Coupled with this, 
local government in resource-constrained contexts often do 
not have the capacity and rightly shaped institutional cultural 
to engage in such initiatives – resulting in a lack of government 
responsiveness. Digital citizen engagement (DCE) has 
emerged over the recent years as a key tool to enable this 
much needed two-way communication and engagement 
between citizens and government (Peixoto & Fox 2016). 
Digital citizen engagement is defined as (Haikin et al. 
2016): ‘The use of new media/digital information and 
communication technologies to create or enhance the 
communication channels which facilitate the interaction 
between citizens and governments or the private sector’ . 
Information and communication technology (ICT) is not 
necessarily a panacea for many challenges being faced in the 
service delivery sector in developing countries; however, an 
ICT-enabled environment could be one of many significant 
means to support service delivery. Examples of key initiatives 
include Ushahidi, FixMyStreet, Maji Voice and MobiSAM. 
Residents use these platforms to report on service delivery 
issues, and track the progress in getting them addressed. 
Digital citizen engagement initiatives can play the role of 
bringing together the voices of individual reports, and 
collective action by activists and civil society organisations 
(CSOs) (illustrated in Figure 1 by Peixoto and Fox [2016]). 
Typically, a citizen would report a service issue directly to a 
municipality that remains as an undisclosed individual 
report, which the general public is unaware of. On the 
contrary, civil society attempts to lobby for more collective 
actions on certain issues reported to collective groups, which 
can at times be isolated and insufficiently reflect the true 
nature of the service delivery issue in the population. The role 
of ICTs is to bring together individual and collective action 
with real-time access to mechanisms to report issues to all 
stakeholders.
Despite the opportunities that exist with ICT and citizen 
engagement, the implementation and beneficial realisation 
of these initiatives by both citizens and government is not 
easy. Digital citizen engagement projects have not yielded the expected benefits to all key stakeholders, resulting in 
much scepticism around supporting such projects. This is 
also quite typical of many ICT for development (ICT4D) 
projects in developing countries. Nevertheless, this does 
not imply that such projects do not have successful outcomes 
– these outcomes can only be fully realised when an effort is 
made to apply endogenous practices to understand 
institutional forces that support or hinder implementation 
and sustainability (Mansell 2011). The failures and 
challenges should be seen by researchers and practitioners 
as opportunities to learn from them, unlearn wrong 
practices and apply incremental changes or develop 
possible mechanisms and theories to address these specific 
failures (Dodson, Sterling & Bennett 2012; Pade-Khene & 
Lannon 2017).
The process of learning from failures, and unlearning 
existing practices that hinder progress, requires a process of 
continuous engagement with key stakeholders in a DCE 
initiative, that is, government and citizens. Toyama (2011) 
points out three fundamental institutional forces that 
influence engagement with ICTs in different contexts: 
differential access, differential capacity and differential 
motivation. These aspects are often embedded in local 
practice and context (endogenous practice); therefore, 
practitioners and researchers need to learn in the local 
context to obtain insight into the factors that influence DCE. 
Furthermore, they need to engage in participatory approaches 
with key beneficiaries, allowing multiple perspectives to 
emerge in an open dialogue of knowledge transfer and 
incremental learning through a consultative process of 
decision-making (Ika & Hodgson 2014; Mansell 2011; Toyama 
2015). Key to building capacities and learning is developing 
the abilities of both local government and citizens to become 
digitally literate, in order to realise and action the true 
benefits of DCE. The aim of this article is to present a case for 
digital literacy development in DCE initiatives in South 
Africa. The two research questions addressed in this article 
include the following: (1) What is the role of digital literacy in 
DCE projects in South Africa? (2) How can digital literacy be 
embedded in knowledge transfer processes for implementing 
DCE initiatives?
To set the background for the article, the case for digital 
literacy and how it is positioned as an outcome of knowledge 
transfer is discussed in a literature review. Subsequently, a 
case study of a DCE project called MobiSAM is presented as 
a reflective case, where a pragmatist approach was applied to 
investigate the development of digital literacy for DCE. 
Szulanski’s (1996) four-stage model is applied as a foundation 
to build an iterative process for developing digital literacy in 
DCE projects at local government level in the South African 
context. The conclusion summarises the findings and 
concludes that the process for knowledge transfer and 
developing digital literacy that is identified in this article can 
provide a guideline for future implementation of DCE in 
resource-constrained contexts.Civic ac/g415onCi/g415zen eng agement

The role of digital literacy in digital 
citizen engagement
Digital literacy emerged from the concept of the digital divide, 
which has traditionally been used to describe the inequalities 
that exist between those who can engage in the digital society 
and those who cannot (Evans & Gomes 2017). This is quite 
pertinent in developing countries, where deducing the digital 
divide was mainly based on aspects of access to technology 
to participate in society – the first-order effect of the digital 
divide. Toyama (2015) argues against this limited view of 
unequal access in the information society, as ‘access’ not only 
goes beyond access to technology or infrastructure, but also 
considers issues of capacity and motivation to effectively and 
strategically use technology for its intended purpose – in the 
case of this article, to use technology to participate in citizen 
engagement. This resulted in what authors call, the second-
order  effect of the digital divide – which moves beyond access 
to also consider social access or the lack of skill to take 
advantage of ICTs (Evans & Gomes 2017; Henninger 2017; 
Huerta & Sandoval-Almazan 2007). The second-order effect 
relates to digital literacy, which has now become the focus 
towards addressing inequalities in the information society. 
The definition of digital literacy seems to vary in the literature, 
with authors providing general definitions that can apply to 
different domains of use. This was studied by Leahy and 
Dolan (2009), who provide a historical account of the defined 
meaning of digital literacy, before they settled on the definition 
provided by the European Union:
Digital Literacy involves the confident and critical use of 
Information Society Technology for work, leisure and 
communication. It is underpinned by Basic skills in ICT: the use 
of computers to retrieve, assess, store, produce, present and 
exchange information, and to communicate and participate in 
collaborative networks via the internet. (p. 152)
The definition by the European Union seems to be more 
specific towards the technical skill needed to use technology. 
Eshet-Alkalai (2004), on the contrary, speaks to more complex 
skills associated with digital literacy, such as cognitive, 
motoric, sociological and emotional – all needed to use digital 
environments effectively. He differentiates between five types 
of digital literacy, which can gradually develop over time 
through different exercises or knowledge transfer processes 
between project implementers, and project beneficiaries 
(government and citizens) (Leahy & Dolan 2009). These 
include photo-visual literacy, reproduction literacy, branching 
literacy, information literacy and socio-emotional literacy 
(Eshet-Alkalai 2004). All these types possibly contribute to 
developing the digital citizen (Coldwell-Neilson 2017) – one 
who is able to purposefully and confidently communicate and 
find information to engage in processes to address some of 
their challenges.
When we interrogate the meaning of digital literacy in the 
field of DCE, there are key skills and knowledge that both 
citizens and government need to possess in order to 
effectively engage in the process. In this case, government and citizens do not only need to be digitally literate but also 
need to be civically literate (Henninger 2017). For digital 
literacy, what is paramount is that citizens have the capacity 
to find, retrieve, interpret and critically evaluate information 
provided on digital platforms. Civic literacy supports digital 
literacy in DCE, as citizens also possess the domain 
knowledge, ability and capacity to make sense of their 
political world and hence effectively act individually or 
collectively to hold government accountable and demand 
key services (Henninger 2017). Digital literacy applies to both 
government and citizens; however, civic literacy is more 
specific to citizens. Literature does not clearly articulate the 
domain literacy that governments should possess to 
effectively participate in DCE. This is quite typical in the field 
of citizen engagement, as the focus has mainly been on 
citizens, where initiatives have taken on an adversarial 
approach to implementation. However, recent literature has 
motivated for focusing on building the capacity for 
government responsiveness, to respond to citizen requests 
and engagement on digital platforms (Daskal 2018; Gigler & 
Bailur 2014; Pade-Khene, Thinyane & Machiri 2017; Peixoto 
& Fox 2016). This is not a forthright process, and at times 
requires process re-engineering and an understanding of the 
valuable contribution of DCE, for government – any citizen 
engagement initiative is often looked at by government with 
suspicion to expose their ineffectiveness, rather than support 
their processes. That said, this research article proposes the 
consideration of responsiveness literacy specific to 
government. When we look at digital literacy in DCE, it 
does not exist as a general entity for technology use, but 
incorporates domain knowledge (Baykurt 2011) in relation 
to civic literacy (citizen) and responsiveness literacy 
(government) (see Figure 2).
Given the above conceptual framework of digital literacy, some 
of the challenges and failures of DCE projects relate to a lack of 
appropriate literacy in the above aspects. As a result, how can 
an individual or group become digitally literate if the means to 
do so are inaccessible and unusable (Leahy & Dolan 2009) – is 
civic literacy and responsiveness literacy effectively embedded 
in the implementation process? Organisations that implement 
DCE initiatives need to embed informed processes of

knowledge transfer between implementers and project 
beneficiaries to build digital literacy. However, each context is 
different, and hence, project implementers need to ensure that 
they are open to learning the endogenous practices of the 
context in order to understand digital literacy deficiencies and 
opportunities (Mansell 2011). These practices need to be applied 
iteratively and incrementally to address barriers and build 
digital literacy. The next sections reflect on this process using 
Szulanski’s four-stage model in the MobiSAM case study.
Research methodology
The philosophical approach adopted for this research is 
pragmatism. This philosophy assists in disclosing the current 
practices associated with DCE initiatives in a local municipality 
and how these practices generate observations to understand 
the phenomenon (Creswell 2014). The pragmatist approach 
allows the researcher to focus their attention on the research 
problem, using various methods to gather information to 
address the problem. Observations and explanations of the 
actors in the research problem context allow for the 
development of knowledge around the aspect of DCE in a 
local municipality of South Africa. Goldkuhl (2012) discusses 
three types of pragmatism: referential, functional and 
methodological. The context of this research study focuses on 
the methodological pragmatism, where the researcher has 
actively participated in the context to provide suggestions and 
implement practices for improvement – in this case, building 
digital literacy. Pragmatism provides researchers with the 
ability to observe, understand, reflect and provide guidelines 
to mediate within a social context (Goldkuhl 2012; Saunders 
et al. 2009). The pragmatist philosophy has not been used 
significantly in research; however, it is instrumental in 
developing change and action, and how knowledge can relate 
to that action (Feilzer 2010; Morgan 2014). This is quite 
fundamental to developing theories within the African context 
(indigenous theory), as information systems theory is quite 
dominated by world views developed in different contexts – 
western and business contexts (Mansell 2011). The premise of 
pragmatism is abductive reasoning, where the researcher 
engages in a process of developing a logical connection 
between theory and empirical data in an iterative fashion. 
Morgan (2014:1049) describes this as ‘… an active process of 
inquiry that creates a continual back-and-forth movement 
between beliefs and actions’ . Therefore, the data collection and 
analysis process in pragmatist research differs from typical 
positivist or interpretive research approaches. In this case, 
moving back and forth between induction and deduction, in 
an enquiry process of problem-solving, does not limit the 
researcher to a ‘forced choice dichotomy between post 
positivism and constructivism’ (Crewell & Plano Clark 2007:27 
in Feilzer 2010:8), restricted to a particular methodology or 
thought approach. Instead, in the context of uncertainty, 
particularly pertinent in DCE in South Africa, the knowledge 
character in pragmatism is constructive in the form of 
prescriptive knowledge (providing guidelines), normative 
knowledge (exhibiting values) and prospective knowledge 
(suggesting possibilities), which are built from descriptions 
and explanations in the enquiry process (Goldkuhl 2012). This is quite an emancipatory process, not only for the researcher 
but also for the research participants engaged in the process of 
problem-solving.
The research strategy applied is a case study to understand how 
digital literacy is developed in the knowledge process of a DCE 
initiative and why it was the suited approach (Yin 2009). The 
case study is MobiSAM, which is an initiative located in the 
Eastern Cape province of South Africa. MobiSAM provides a 
platform for two-way communication between local 
government and citizens on public service delivery issues. It is 
built on an operational model of iterative and incremental 
development, stakeholder engagement, strategy formulation 
and capacity building, comprehensive evaluation and citizen 
education (Pade-Khene et al. 2017). The MobiSAM technology 
incorporates both a reporting interface for citizens (via a mobile 
application [feature phone or smartphone], website and short 
message service [SMS]) and also a ticketing function (mainly 
used by the municipality to address internal communication 
challenges). MobiSAM presents a useful case study to 
demonstrate how knowledge was transferred between various 
stakeholders in the project (including the project 
implementation team), to build digital literacy among key 
beneficiaries – unit of analysis. This is still an ongoing process, 
as digital literacy development is gradual and uncertain, 
considering the factors that hinder DCE implementation, such 
as information poverty, lack of political commitment, digital 
exclusion, internet access and lack of incentive and motivation 
(Gigler, Bailur & Anand 2014). Data were collected using a 
qualitative approach with the following tools:
•	Interviews: Both semi-structured and unstructured 
interviews were applied, to allow understanding from 
the uncertain context to unfold, based on the experience 
of project participants. Government officials, citizens and 
project implementers were interviewed. Government 
officials interviewed included three service department 
managers, three communication and two customer care 
staff, three technicians, and two IT staff. Citizens 
interviewed included civil society representatives and 
community activists.
•	Participant observation: The researcher participated in 
workshops and forums organised by the MobiSAM 
project, civil society and the local municipality. Examples 
of local government meetings included service 
management meetings, special council meetings and 
public forums on service delivery. Civil society forums 
and rights workshops were also organised to bring 
together various stakeholders in the municipality. Lastly, 
MobiSAM held public awareness meetings, needs 
assessment workshop, civil rights workshops, training a 
workshops and strategy formulation workshops.
•	Document analysis: Documentation from the MobiSAM 
project was also analysed to supplement the field data. A 
baseline study report was reviewed to identify key 
communication ecologies and challenges in the 
municipality.
The case study is described in relation to the knowledge 
transfer process by Szulanski (1996), building explanations on Page 5 of 9 Original Research
http://www.rw.org.za Open Access
the experiences of project stakeholders and the researcher as a 
key participant in the project. The analysis of data mainly 
relied on abductive reasoning, using Yin’s (2009) analysis 
approach of explanation building. This approach builds an 
explanation about the case, developing causal links in an 
iterative manner. The iterative process was applied as follows:
•	Re-examine the components of the knowledge transfer 
process proposed by Szulanski (1996).
•	Compare the qualitative findings of the observation of 
the project implementation processes that incorporate 
knowledge transfer (consciously and unconsciously – 
given uncertainty), against Szulanski’s knowledge 
transfer model.
•	Contextualise Szulanski’s knowledge transfer process in 
the MobiSAM case – allowing for the emergence of an 
organic process of knowledge transfer in digital literacy 
development.
The above process was repeated at different phases of the 
project from early 2016 to mid-2017. To provide contextual 
background to the study and to build the analysis, the 
stakeholders of the project and their contribution to the 
knowledge transfer process are first identified and discussed 
in the case study description.
Stakeholders of the MobiSAM 
project
Stakeholders in the knowledge transfer process mainly 
consist of the project implementation team and key 
beneficiaries, that is, local government, citizens and civil 
society. Media also plays a key role in the DCE; however, at 
the current stage of the project, this article will not dwell on 
this particular stakeholder. All these stakeholders interact in 
a web of complexity and uncertainty in an environment that 
is politically influenced, as well as marginalised (Pade-Khene & Lannon 2017). Conflicting perspectives exist between 
stakeholders as well as within stakeholder groups – in this 
case, each group has a specific objective that they expect to 
achieve with MobiSAM. Building digital literacy requires 
that all stakeholders engage in a shared understanding of 
how a DCE can be effectively used and embedded in active 
citizenship practices and government responsiveness 
practices. The project manager of a DCE initiative needs to 
devise strategies to engage all key stakeholders (either 
separately or together), in an effort to learn how best the DCE 
initiative can function within its context. Table 1 provides a 
summary of conflicting aspects that emerge in different 
stakeholder groups in the MobiSAM project. It is important 
to know these to highlight the challenges that need to be 
overcome within the iterative process of knowledge transfer 
and digital literacy development. Table 1 also shows the 
literacy focus areas embedded in digital literacy for each 
group, with the exception of the project team that plays the 
role of source or facilitator (where knowledge exists within 
the beneficiary groups) of knowledge transfer.
Knowledge transfer and digital 
literacy development in MobiSAM
Knowledge transfer is a fundamental process for 
organisational learning in the business context. It emerges 
from the need to apply knowledge management as a key 
practice for maintaining and sharing key strategic knowledge 
on business operations. In the context of DCE, this mainly 
relates to managing knowledge that can be used by the 
community or key beneficiaries. Conger (2015) is known to 
be one of the few authors who contextualise knowledge 
management for ICT4D. In the context of ICT4D, knowledge 
managed is defined as a ‘systematic process of acquisition, 
organisation, and communication of organisational member 
knowledge for reuse by others in the community’ (Conger 
TABLE 1:  Conflicting aspects of each stakeholder group.
Stakeholder Conflicting aspects Digital literacy focus areas
Project Team • Diverse mindsets and disciplines: The MobiSAM team has an advantage of being 
diverse in terms of discipline and experience, as a citizen engagement project 
requires diverse perspectives to be more holistic and relevant to the target 
beneficiaries.
• However, project team members’ views can clash, based on their backgrounds – 
for example, some being task-orientated verses people-orientated, more technical 
versus more social. • Mainly the source of building digital literacy.
• However, the role does oscillate between a source  and facilitator of 
knowledge transfer for developing digital literacy for digital citizen 
engagement.
• Diversity of skill is paramount in this groups – hence, working towards a 
shared understanding to implement digital citizen engagement is 
important.
• Context literacy later emerges as a focus area, but not necessarily as part 
of digital literacy.
Citizens • Divided social and economic aspects: This is such a loaded aspect; however, 
perspectives between different groups such as the youth, women, men and 
elderly can conflict.
• In the case of South Africa, income inequalities are still real, and the history of 
apartheid has different groups in very dire living circumstances.
• What is paramount to one citizen may be different for another. Coupled with this 
is a complete lack of trust in government, because of a lack of government 
responsiveness that has plagued local municipalities in marginalised contexts.• Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy.
Civil Society • Conflicting goals and representations:  Civil Society in Makana Municipality is 
quite divided and not enough collaboration exists; yet, they typically share many 
goals. Furthermore, it is typically observed that they have an agenda to hold 
government to account, rather than collaborate, being sensitive to the 
constraints of government.
• A shared goal needs to be nurtured and facilitate among CSOs.• Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Civic Literacy.
Government • Political influence and resource constraints:  Part of the local municipality is 
politically controlled and the other is administratively managed.
• As a result, some decisions are based on political agendas. Furthermore, local 
municipalities are resource-constrained because of ineffective planning – some 
staff who try to work effectively are constrained by this and feel that citizens do 
not understand the challenges experienced. • Focus area embedded in digital literacy is Responsiveness Literacy.

2015:114). Organisational learning is closely linked to the 
process of developing digital literacy for citizens and 
government. Here, organisational learning refers to ‘internal 
adaptation processes triggered by some kind of disjunction 
or unease in the relationship between the organisation and 
what lies external and challenging to it in its environment’ 
(Spender 2008:160). Digital literacy aims to build the capacity 
of citizens and government to effectively participate in DCE – 
this can be performed through a process of learning, training 
and engagement. For digital literacy to develop in the 
MobiSAM project, it had to undergo a process of learning, 
unlearning and knowledge transfer. This process is not 
necessarily linear, but iterative to adapt to changes in the 
complex and uncertain context. Szulanski’s (1996) four-stage 
model presents a process that is used to describe the process 
of knowledge transfer in the MobiSAM case – in describing 
this process, key features and practices of digital literacy 
development at each stage are identified. Knowledge transfer 
occurs through the dyadic exchange of knowledge between a 
source and recipient. For each stakeholder identified in Table 
1, the role of ‘source’ and ‘recipient’ is interchangeable, 
depending on the knowledge shared. The four stages include 
initiation, implementation, ramp-up and integration:
•	Initiation – As the first step in the process, this consists of 
events that lead to a decision to transfer knowledge. In this 
case, the need for knowledge transfer to support DCE is 
identified, as well as the feasibility of such an initiative. 
The constraints of the possible implementation of a DCE 
initiative are also explored in the context. In the MobiSAM 
case study, the project team needed to explore the status of 
digital literacy, including civic literacy and responsiveness 
literacy in the context. This is based on the understanding 
of the communication ecologies of citizens and government 
in relation to civic participation and responsiveness to 
service delivery reporting. A baseline study was conducted, 
which consisted mainly of two surveys: the first survey 
was distributed to citizens and the second survey was 
distributed to local government staff. This survey explored 
the existing approaches for communication and citizen 
participation, identifying traditional ways of engagement 
and the use of technology for engagement between 
government and citizens. In addition to the survey, the 
project team engaged in workshops, informal interviews 
and government public forums to understand the status of 
digital literacy, civic literacy and responsiveness literacy. 
After the baseline study, a needs assessment was conducted 
to explore the key needs related to the use of technology 
for citizen engagement and possible constraints. This was 
a more focused exercise, in relation to the purpose of 
MobiSAM, to provide a platform for social accountability 
monitoring. The purpose of this stage was to therefore 
explore the needs for digital literacy development and the 
feasibility of building digital literacy in the project 
implementation process. This stage is not static and once 
off, as demand-driven needs can emerge as the MobiSAM 
project is adopted in the context. In this case, a needs 
assessment can be reintroduced in project activities to re-
evaluate existing digital literacy needs in the project.•	Implementation – This is the stage where the transfer of 
knowledge begins, and resources flow between the source 
and recipient. The project team acts as a source of 
knowledge for developing digital literacy; however, they 
also become a recipient of new knowledge from citizen 
and governments that shapes their activities to develop 
digital literacy for the context. As a recipient of knowledge, 
they begin to understand protocol, legislation, 
accountability processes, transparency requirements, 
local culture and so on that govern the process of local 
citizen engagement. An understanding of these aspects 
shapes their programme for guiding the development of 
digital literacy to effectively use MobiSAM platforms. In 
this case, government, citizens and civil society become 
the source of knowledge transfer, playing an interactive 
game of learning and informing. The MobiSAM project 
team also played the role of facilitator, in enabling an 
understanding of how to effectively integrate and use the 
MobiSAM platform. This was applied through strategy 
formulation workshops with citizens and government 
(separately and then jointly to manage conflicting views), 
meetings with municipal management staff and CSO 
leadership, engaging in the revision of the municipal 
communication strategy, civic education and adaptive 
ICT training on how to use MobiSAM platforms. An 
important aspect is that social ties begin to develop 
between source and recipient, and stakeholders work 
towards a mutual understanding of how MobiSAM can 
best work in Makana Municipality. Szulanski (1996) 
articulates this as follows:
The transferred practice is often adapted to suit the anticipated 
needs of the recipient, to pre-empt problems experienced in a 
previous transfer of the same practice, or to help make the 
introduction of new knowledge less threatening to the recipient. 
(p. 29)
Initial understanding and development of digital literacy 
is enabled  during this stage of knowledge transfer. 
Furthermore, the project team begins to understand 
contextual dynamics of both government and citizens, 
hence context literacy (endogenous practice) – the 
competence or knowledge to interact and engage in these 
spheres (Mansell 2011). The implementation stage stops, 
when project beneficiaries begin to use the gained 
knowledge on digital literacy.
•	Ramp-up: This is the stage when the recipients of 
knowledge begin to use the new knowledge in the 
context. This was the stage that citizens began to see the 
value of the MobiSAM platforms and engage via the 
Facebook page, email, SMS and the MobiSAM website. In 
relation to the citizen, additional civic education 
workshops had to be held with civil society, media, local 
schools and development centres in Makana Municipality. 
Furthermore, the project had hired ward liaisons in the 
community to impart awareness and knowledge of 
MobiSAM, and based on the train-the-trainer model, 
train local community members in their wards to use the 
various platforms effectively. The value of a new initiative  Page 7 of 9 Original Research
http://www.rw.org.za Open Access
can sometimes only be seen and understood from the 
perspective of common members of a networked system, 
whether it is the youth, woman support networks or 
schools. Therefore, MobiSAM activities attempt to 
incorporate key actors involved in these networks in 
order to maximise on participation. This has been a very 
challenging process, as the process of building digital 
literacy for DCE is often met with resistance and lack of 
resources to support development. This is clearly evident 
from Figure 3, which is a map of reported issues – the 
reported issues are centred on a particular location in 
Makana Municipality (more affluent areas), which is 
closer to the centre of town and the local university.
•	It is important that unexpected problems or barriers are 
identified that hinder the alignment of transferred 
knowledge and expected performance of the adapted 
practices (Szulanski 1996). This is no different for local government. Local government staff strategised for the 
integration of MobiSAM in Makana Municipality and 
participated in workshop sessions to re-engineer their 
existing processes to adapt better communication practice 
with MobiSAM. This was successful among some 
municipal staff, who confessed that they now saw the 
value of feedback in communicating with citizens, based 
on the development of their digital literacy around 
government responsiveness. Their original system, 
identified in the initiation stage, showed how broken 
their communication ecology was, with a lack of feedback 
culture and engagement with citizens. Nonetheless, 
MobiSAM was met with much resistance from some 
municipal staff – requiring the MobiSAM project team to 
rethink their implementation approach to address the 
existing constraints. Some social and organisational 
culture constraints may be beyond the scope of MobiSAM

practices; nonetheless, formulating key partnerships with 
other government officials and CSOs may push for the 
transformation of current practice in the municipality. In 
relation to building digital literacy, this stage relates to 
engaged literacy development.
•	Integration: This stage is reached when digital literacy is 
developed and institutionalised in government and civil 
society practice, as well as becoming an embedded skill of 
active citizens. Satisfactory results of the existence of 
digital literacy should begin to emerge. Certain practices 
related to interaction with evidence-based data for citizen 
engagement and government responsiveness become 
associated with various actors, departments and 
individuals. As digital literacy showed initial progress in 
becoming embedded, MobiSAM became formerly 
integrated into the municipality communication strategy. 
The project team is always invited to participate in key 
strategic forums of the municipality, as digitally literate 
government staff engage in discussions and practices 
around using MobiSAM, and the data generated from it. 
Citizens have also began to use MobiSAM as a point of 
call for reporting issues, perusing the digital platform for 
similarly reported issues to engage in discussion about 
them with an understanding of the severity of the issue. 
Civil societies such as the Grahamstown Residents 
Association (GRA), Public Accountability Monitor 
(PSAM) and Black Sash (BS) now invite MobiSAM as a 
strategic partner into their civic workshops. The evidence 
gathered from the technology platforms is often used by 
the GRA to follow up on unaddressed issues or to lobby 
for key services. Despite the many benefits of having 
reached a level of digital literacy with some stakeholders, 
there are still issues of ‘stickiness’ that hinder the 
effectiveness of the process and call for a continuous 
iterative approach, building on the lessons learned 
from each of the stages of knowledge transfer. Therefore, 
this process should not be linear, but lessons learned 
should feed into another staged iteration of initiation 
to explore emerged aspects of digital literacy and citizen 
engagement.
Table 2 provides a summary of the knowledge transfer 
process of digital literacy development in the MobiSAM DCE 
project. Various practices emerged that can guide each stage 
of literacy development – practices indicated in Table 2 are 
suggestions, but not limited to these, as practitioners or 
researchers may apply different approaches within the 
constraints of the project and context. Nonetheless, this provides a starting point from which to build on. What was 
also identified in the knowledge transfer process was the 
digital literacy development focus at each stage of the transfer 
process. In this case, digital literacy developed through a 
Quadruple-E process of: (1) explore, (2) enable, (3) engage 
and (4) embed.
The transfer of knowledge is likely to experience what 
Szulanski (1996) refers to as internal ‘stickiness’, which is 
based on the characteristics of knowledge transferred, the 
source of the knowledge, recipients of the knowledge (Ajmal 
& Koskinen 2008) and the context (Ajmal & Koskinen 2008; 
Yeh, Lai & Ho 2006). Pade-Khene and Lannon (2017) relate 
this to the issue of power and political influence in DCE – 
diverse stakeholder perspectives and conflicting views result 
in the need for ad hoc solutions as problems emerge in the 
transfer process. Nonetheless, Orlikowski (2002:271) argues 
that it is a gradual process of developing ‘know-how’ in the 
transfer process, so as to understand the origins of stickiness 
in order to work around them and maximise on digital 
literacy development. The issues of stickiness are not foreign 
to the ICT4D field and hence relate a lot to Toyama’s three 
differentials that influence digital implementation in 
developing countries (see Table 3). Project stakeholders need 
to be aware of these and mitigate their influence in the 
knowledge transfer process.
Conclusion
The research study presents a case for developing digital 
literacy in DCE initiatives. This is pertinent as DCE has 
emerged as a key tool in supporting two-way communication 
between citizens and government. It also contributes to 
building evidence-based data that can be used to support 
social accountability and transparency practices. The article 
identifies that DCE is not a straightforward process, where 
some factors that hinder progress relate to a lack of 
effectively building digital literacy among citizens and TABLE 3:  A comparison of information and communication technology for 
development differentials and aspects of stickiness.

government as project beneficiaries. In the case of DCE, 
digital literacy does not only relate to the technical ability to 
use ICTs but also relate to embedded competence in civic 
literacy and responsiveness literacy. Using Szulanski’s 
(1996) four-stage process of knowledge transfer, the 
MobiSAM project is reflected on in terms of the practices 
applied to transfer knowledge and develop digital literacy 
of its stakeholders. The process was identified as iterative 
and incremental in nature, with key focus areas for digital 
literacy at the different stages, that is, the Quadruple-E 
process of (1) explore, (2) enable, (3) engage and (4) embed. 
Despite the benefits of knowledge transfer, this process is 
affected by factors that hinder progress, referred to as 
‘stickiness’. The aspects identified relate closely to 
differentials of ICT4D proposed by Toyama (2011) – this 
highlights the significance of addressing digital access, 
motivation and capacity in developing digital literacy; and 
having DCE classified within the field of ICT4D. The 
process for knowledge transfer and developing digital 
literacy that was identified in this article can provide a 
guideline for future implementation of DCE initiatives in 
resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract
Purpose –The purpose of this paper is to present findings of a study conducted to determine eReadiness
status of public university libraries in Malawi to use mobile phones in the provision of library and
information services.
Design/methodology/approach –The researcher carried out in-depth semi-structured interviews with
university/college librarians and information and communications technology (ICT) directors using interview
guides. Students were also administered with a survey questionnaire that contained closed- and someopen-ended questions. Proceedings of the interviews were recorded using a tape recorder whilst backup notes
were recorded in a notebook. Qualitative data were transcribed and analysed using NVivo software whilst
quantitative data were analysed using SPPS.
Findings –The study findings revealed that institutions studied had the ICT infrastructure necessary for
offering library and information services on the mobile phone platform. Moreover, students had mobile
phones which were connected to internet to facilit ate their access to services offered. However, the
institutions covered by this study did not have operat ional ICT policies to govern the operations of library
and information services offered through mobile phones although draft ICT policies were available. The
study further concluded that though the human resources required to manage the provision of library and
information services through mobile phones in the in stitutions studied were available, they did not have
the necessary skills and numbers to provide quality services. Other findings revealed that attitudes oflibrary staff and students to the offering and access to services through mobile phones were positive. The
study also revealed that there are some factors that cou ld impact the offering of library services through
mobile phones.
Research limitations/implications –Although Malawi has four public universities, this study only
focused on three of them. Moreover, academic staff is another important user group of academic libraries.
In this case, findings reported in this paper only focus on students. This implies that library ’s readiness to
offer services through mobile phones to this group remains unknown hence may have to be covered by
future studies. Much as the study incorporated a quantitative strand in addition to the qualitative one,
it neither involved theory testing nor confirmation as is the case with other related studies. This impliesthat the two theories used in this study (the uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use of technology and the
technology-organisation-environment) were not used in the strict sense, which is empirical at the core,
but rather to put the problem studied in the context of other related studies.
Practical implications –The findings have practical implications in that they can be used for planning the
implementation of library and information services through mobile phones in public university libraries in
Malawi. Other related institutions can also use the findings as a reference point in planning theimplementation of similar services.
Originality/value –Studies relating to the use of mobile phones in the delivery of library and information
services have not been conducted in public universities in Malawi. Findings of this study will, therefore,inform researchers intending to conduct similar or related studies not only in public universities in Malawi
but other related institutions as well.

Introduction
Lou (2010) defines eReadiness as the ability of a country, enterprise or organisational unit
to be prepared, willing to adopt, use and benefit from e-innovations such as e-business,
e-procurement, e-learning, etc. In other word s, eReadiness refers to the extent to which a
society, country or an organisation is prepare d to partake competitively in the digital age.
Such an e-ready society, cou ntry or organisation will have in place an enabling
information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure (mobile, Wi-Fi and
broadband internet connectivity), human capacity, relevant policy and regulatory
framework and a conducive business envi ronment (Mutula and van Brakel, 2006).
The proliferation of mobile phones the world over has particularly made these tools
important determinants of eReadiness of societi es, countries or organisations in the digital
dispensation. A country, society or organis ation that is e-ready is bound to register
greater usage of ICTs. On the contrary, uptake of ICTs would diminish in an environment
in which these indicators are lacking.
University libraries are increasingly offe ring their services thro ugh a number of mobile
phone applications (Luo, 2014) and also creating webpages that are accessed through
mobile phones (Bridges et al., 2010; Wilson and McCarthy, 2010) . In the context of Malawi,
no studies on the use of mobile phone to prov ide library and information services are
available. From the broader African perspect ive, a few university libraries have adopted
the use of mobile phones in libraries, whic h use them mainly for SMS text messaging
(Anbu and Mavuso, 2012; Sekyere, 2011). A st udy conducted by Sekyere (2011) involving
79 academic libraries in ten West African co untries found that none of the libraries
surveyed used mobile phones i n service delivery. However , a recent study conducted by
Baro et al. (2014) covering 36 Nigerian University lib raries found that less than half of the
libraries used mobile phone SMS for referen ce services. A pilot SMS project conducted by
Anbu and Mavuso (2012) at the University o f Swaziland revealed that SMS was used
successfully to market library services.
Public university libraries in Malawi are under-resourced especially with regard to ICT
infrastructure such as computers (Chaputula, 2012; Bates et al., 2011). In addition, most of
the days, libraries are open for limited hours because of limited human capacity. Moreover,
most students stay off-campus (official student enrolment statistics, February 2015) and
have limited access to the library most of the time. This is exacerbated by the fact that the
library collections are in limited supply (Mapulanga, 2011).
The use of mobile phones to provide library and information services in Malawi has the
potential to enhance access to library resources beyond the normal opening hours hence can
assist to overcome the obstacles of time and space (Malik and Mahmood, 2013), and bring
convenience to library users (Ballard and Blaine, 2013). This would also help provide access
to e-resources by those who do not have access to institutional computer facilities thereby
assist to erase the challenge of PC shortage which is common in many libraries of
developing countries (Palumbo, 2014).
This study, therefore, investigated the eReadiness of public university libraries in
Malawi to use mobile phones to provide library and information services. The study
specifically addressed the following research questions:
RQ1. What is the eReadiness status of public university libraries in Malawi in relation to
ICT infrastructure to deliver library and information services through mobile phones?
RQ2. To what extent do public university libraries in Malawi have the requisite
human resources to enable them deliver lib rary and information services through
mobile phones?
RQ3. How well are public university libraries in Malawi e-ready in terms of policy to
deliver library and information services through mobile phones?LHT

RQ4. What are the attitudes of library staff and students towards the potential use of
mobile phones in providing and accessing library and information services?
RQ5. Which possible factors influence the adoption and use of mobile phones by library
staff and students, respectively, in providing and accessing library and
information services?
It is expected that the outcome from the study would pave the way for policy, practical and
managerial interventions in areas of infrastructure development, capacity building,
awareness creation, institutional framework and budgetary support to prepare the ground
for using mobile phones to provide library and information services at public university
libraries in Malawi.
Literature review
Literature reviewed in this section focusses on the level of preparedness of public university
libraries in Malawi in terms of ICT infrastructure, policy framework and human capacity for
the adoption and use of mobile phones in providing library and information services. These
issues deal with the eReadiness status of the libraries. Literature relating to attitudes of
library staff and students to the use of mobile phones in the delivery of library services is
also reviewed.
eReadiness status of public university libraries in relation to ICT infrastructure
ICT infrastructure is vital in determining the eReadiness status of a library with regard to the
offering of library and information services. A number of studies (Li, 2013; Wang et al., 2012;
Bridges et al., 2010) have shown that libraries are making use of mobile internet, SMS and
MMS in the delivery of both user and reference services. The successful implementation of
such services requires computer hardware and software, campus networking equipment
and a robust mobile telecommunications network. Whilst students may use service
provider mobile network service to access SMS and internet-based services on their mobile
devices, other services such as video streaming as provided at the Oriental Institute of
Technology Library in Taiwan (Wang et al., 2012) may prove very costly on this platform.
University-provided Wi-Fi connection, which can be accessed whilst students are on campus,
may help to overcome this challenge. A university may, therefore, have to invest in such
type of infrastructure to promote mobile phone access to such services. Although the
university-managed ICT infrastructure is of primary importance in deciding whether a library
is ready or not to offer library services through the use of mobile phones, the external or
national mobile telecommunications infrastructure is equally important. This is because indeciding whether or not to commence offering of such services, a library would be interested
to know whether its clients (in this case students) would be able to access the services offered.
A mobile telecommunications network that has broader coverage, performs reliably, is easy to
connect to, offers high-speed internet access and has broader service offering is, therefore,
desirable. A library will also be interested to know if its clients have the requisite skills to
access the services on offer before making a decision on whether or not to offer its services
through the use of mobile phones.
eReadiness status of public university libraries in relation to human resources
Human resource is another important element for determining the eReadiness status of
libraries with respect to the delivery of services through the use of mobile phones. Lessons
learnt from projects aimed at offering library and information services through mobile
phone undertaken at both Ryerson University Library (Wilson and McCarthy, 2010) and
Oregon State University Library (Bridges et al., 2010) indicate that joint teams of expertseReadiness

university
libraries
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
that included professional librarians and ICT personnel worked together in overseeing the
successful implementation of such projects. The role of librarians was to plan and oversee
the implementation of the whole project in terms of determining the content to be displayed
on the mobile websites, soliciting views of users in terms of content and services to include
on mobile website, and assessment of use after project implementation. The role of the ICT
team was to offer technical support in terms of building the website and managing it. It can,
therefore, be seen that the presence of various individuals with different types of expertise
played a critical role in the successful implementation of such projects.
A preliminary study conducted in the institutions surveyed revealed that they possess
the requisite human resource complement both in the library and the ICT departments.
However, it is not known whether the staff is adequate to enable them to successfully
manage the provision of library and information services through mobile phones. It is also
feared that the available staff may lack the necessary skills to enable them to successfully
manage the delivery of library and information services through mobile phones. This study
will, therefore, help expose the magnitude of the existing challenges, and offer possible
solutions to those challenges.
eReadiness status of public university libraries in relation to availability of policy
Policy is equally important in project implementation. Evans et al. (2000) define policy as a
statement intended to guide and channel staff thinking in making decisions. Policies may
also be looked at as rules or instructions that are intended to facilitate decision making
(Stueart and Moran, 2002). Policies are advantageous in that they help in ensuring
consistency in decision making, particularly in an environment whereby several decision
makers exist. However, the downside of policies is that they do not give much room for the
decision maker to operate in, as the decision-making process is bound by the policy.
Several types of policies exist. These include originated, appealed, implied and imposed
policies (Stueart and Moran, 2002; Evans et al. , 2000). An originated policy is one that is
developed to guide the general operations of an organisation. This sort of policy is internally
influenced as it is initiated by top management, and is meant to guide the operations of the
organisation as it strives to achieve its objectives. An appealed policy is another kind of
policy that mainly arises from a situation where there is no policy. This sort of policy is,
therefore, formulated in response to appeals from those affected by the lack of policy to sort
out challenges that may have come about due to the absence of the policy. Implied policy is
yet another type of policy that exists in an organisation. This type of policy is mainly
unwritten hence informal, and arises from the actions that people see around them andhence believe to constitute a policy. The final type of existing policy is what is called an
imposed policy which normally comes from outside entities which an organisation must
work with. These entities include companies, donor agencies, government, etc.
Policies, as already discussed, play a crucial role in the operations and activities of a
library organisation and are important in determining the eReadiness status of a library
with regard to the offering of library and information services through the use of mobile
phones. For instance, policies that govern the allocation of financial resources could
positively impact a library ’s ability to offer services through mobile phones if such policies
favour allocation of adequate resources to the library to enable it to carry out its activities.
On the other hand, such activities could be negatively affected if resources are inadequate.
Similarly, policies on human resource recruitment and training could either negatively or
positively impact the eReadiness status of the library to offer services through mobile
phones as this could affect the availability of well-trained human resources to manage the
project. Policies pursued by external entities such as publishers, donor agencies and
government could equally have both a positive and negative impact on a library ’s ability to
offer services through the use of mobile phones. For instance, a library ’s ability to offerLHT
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
services through mobile phones could be affected if publisher ’s formulated policies restricted
access to e-resources. This could particularly be a major limiting factor if e-resources were the
main resource users wished to access on the mobile phone platform. Furthermore, favourable
or unfavourable government policies on mobile telecommunications, recruitment and training,
particularly to subvented organisations or even funding could also greatly affect a library ’s
ability to offer services through mobile phones.
Malawi launched the national ICT policy in 2013. This development would likely assist in
the implementation of ICT projects including library and information services through mobile
phones. However, most of the institutions surveyed seem not to have operational ICT policies,
a development that could negatively impact the management of library and information
services through mobile phones as the service may lack a framework for regulation.
Theoretical framework
This study was underpinned by two main theories: the uni ﬁed theory of acceptance and use
of technology (UTAUT) and the technology-organisation-environment (TOE) framework.
UTAUT
UTAUT is a model that is often used in ICT-related studies. The model was developed and
validated by Venkatesh et al. (2003) through the review, mapping and integration of eight
dominant theories and models that originated from different theoretical disciplines such as
psychology, sociology and information systems (Williams et al., 2012; Kijsanayotin et al., 2009).
UTAUT was developed on the basis that constructs of existing theories were similar in
nature; therefore, it was logical to map and integrate them to create a uni ﬁed theoretical basis
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). The model identifies four key drivers of the adoption of information
systems: performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI) and
facilitating conditions (FC) (Martin and Herrero, 2012). The model centres on two key issues,
namely behavioural intention (BI) and actual usage (AU). PE, EE and SI influence BI which in
turn influences AU. Empirical studies have shown that FC, on the other hand, does not have
any influences on BI but directly influences AU (Venkatesh et al., 2003). Besides the four main
constructs of the model (PE, EE, SI and FC), UTAUT identifies the moderating effect of four
other factors such as gender, age, experience and voluntariness of usage (Keong et al., 2012).
The strength of the UTAUT model lies in the fact that it was founded on so many
models and thus providing the researcher with a broader view of all existing models.
Moreover, UTAUT is a much stronger model as it accounts for an explanatory power of
up to 70 per cent unlike the other previous m odels that account for only between 17 and
53 per cent of the variance in use intentions (Venkatesh et al., 2003). UTAUT has its own
weaknesses too. Scholars such as Straub and Burton-Jones (2007) have claimed that the
ten constructs of UTAUT are not parsimon ious. In spite of this weakness, the use of
UTAUT in this study is justified on the basis that its strengths far outweigh its
weaknesses. Besides, the model has been used in other related studies such as the study of
the adoption of mobile devices (Carlsson et al. , 2006), the use of “near ﬁeld
communication ”, adoption of mobile phone service (Chen and Chang, 2013) and the use
of mobile internet (Wang and Wang, 2010).
TOE framework
TOE is an organisational-level theory that was introduced by Tornatzky and Fleischer in
1990 (Baker, 2012; Oliveira and Martins, 2011). TOE framework posits that technological
adoption in an organisation is mainly driven by technological, organisational and
environmental factors. Some scholars (Yang et al., 2015; Hsu et al., 2014; Ramdani et al., 2013)
postulate that the TOE framework is grounded on Rogers ’DOI theory. Hsu et al. (2014),
specifically, argue that both the technological and organisational factors in the TOEeReadiness

university
libraries
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
framework are similar to other factors in the DOI theory such as innovation, communication
channels and social system, and that Tornatzky and Fleischer only added the new
component of the environmental context. This argument is made on the basis that most of
the elements that make up the technological and organisational factors are largely drawn
from the DOI theory.
The technological context
The technological context includes all of the technologies that are relevant to the ﬁrm
(Baker, 2012). They include technologies that are already in use at the ﬁrm as well as those
not currently deployed but are available in the market place hence capable of being used in
future. According to Collins et al. (1988), a ﬁrm’s existing technologies are important in that
they set a broad limit on the scope and pace of technological change that a ﬁrm can
undertake. On the other hand, innovations that exist but are not yet in use at the ﬁrm are
equally important because they in ﬂuence innovation in two main ways. First, they
demarcate the limits of what is possible; and second, they show ﬁrms ways or means
through which technology can enable them to evolve and or indeed adapt to changes taking
place. Some of the notable elements that comprise the technological context include
compatibility, relative advantage, ease of use, cost and trialability (Al-Somali et al., 2015).
All these elements are derived from the component of innovation of the DOI theory.
Organisational context
Organisational context addresses the trait s and characteristics of the organisation
that influence innovation adoption decisions (Hsu et al. , 2014). Ramdani et al. (2013)
identified top management support, organisat ional readiness, experience and size as some
of the critical organisational factors that in fluence technological adoption. Baker (2012),
whilst highlighting the same issues raised by Ramdani et al. added intra- ﬁrm
communication processes and the amount of slack resources available to the firm as
being equally important.
The environmental context
Baker (2012) defines environmental context as the structure of the industry, the presence or
absence of technology service providers and the regulatory environment. All of these factors
affect technology adoption in various ways. With regard to the structure of the industry,
two main players that include business partners and clients tend to have a great influence in
terms of what type of technologies an organisation adopts. In case of the library and
information field, a library could be forced to adopt technologies such as the use of mobile
phones in providing library and information services to properly serve the information
needs of its clients. This could be done either in response to the changing information-
seeking patterns of its clients or based on demand. Again, a library could be forced to adopt
certain technologies with the aim of keeping pace with other players in the same field. This
is what DiMaggio and Powel (1983) described as mimetic pressure, which is defined as the
influences of structurally equivalent organisations that have initiated an innovation
successfully (Figure 1).
Justification for use of the TOE framework in this study
The TOE framework was chosen for use in this study for two main reasons. First, it is
flexible and adaptable in various contexts. Zhu and Kraemer (2005) observe that the TOE
framework is a generic theory that only suggests different sources of influence without
specifying the variables in each context unlike most of the other theories and models. This
enables researchers to choose different technological, organisational and environmentalLHT
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
factors for different innovations. Second, the model has been used in other related studies
such as the study of e-business/e-commerce adoption (Awiagah et al. , 2016), adoption of
cloud computing (Hsu et al., 2014) and eReadiness at the firm level (Aboelmaged, 2014).
Methodology
This study made use of a multi-case study design. Malawi has four public universities. They
include the University of Malawi (UNIMA), Mzuzu University (MZUNI), Lilongwe
University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), and Malawi University of
Science and Technology (MUST). UNIMA has four constituent colleges, namely Chancellor
College (CHANCO), Kamuzu College of Nursing (KCN), The Polytechnic and College of
Medicine (COM) whilst the other universities only have one campus. Although potentially
seven study institutions existed, this research covered only five of them: MZUNI, LUANAR,
The Polytechnic, COM and KCN. Libraries selected for this study are affiliated to older andwell-established institutions except MUST which was established in 2013, and did not have
students in the third, fourth and fifth years at the time of data collection. CHANCO was not
included in the study despite being older and well established because the permission was
not secured to access the respondents. The combined student population in the institutions
studied exceeded 10,000. The case study was deemed appropriate for this study because it
enabled the researcher to examine the phenomena under investigation in depth individually
in the five institutions, and also draw conclusions collectively across the study sites.
Self-completed questionnaires were administered to a sample of 370 students in
years 3, 4, 5 and postgraduates drawn using a s ampling table provided by Israel (2013).
A decision to limit the study to these catego ries of students was made because they are
involved in more intensive research activities hence capable of using their mobile phones
for a wider range of academic-related purpos es including library use. The researcher also
conducted semi-structured interviews wit h a purposefully drawn out sample of five
university/college libraria ns. The university/college librarians were seen as the most
appropriate sample for this study because the y were in a position to provide information
that helped to answer most of the study question s as heads of their institutional librariesExternal Task Environment

(Sekaram and Bougie, 2010). In terview guides that contained open-ended questions were
used in conducting semi-structured intervi ews whilst tape recorders and notebooks were
used to capture and record proceedings of th e interviews respectively. The researcher
personally conducted these interviews. This was done because the number of interviewees
was small, hence manageable, and also to ma intain consistency in coding. Conversely,
quantitative data for this study were collected by a team of five research assistants
(one research assistant for each study site). The research data were collected between
November 2015 and March 2016.
A number of methods were used to validate the data collection instruments.
The interview guides were given out to some experienced researchers who commented on
their appropriateness. Comments received from such experts together with observations
and feedback received during pilot testing were used in amending the instruments to
enhance their effectiveness. The researcher also used another technique called member
checking to validate the research findings. This is a commonly used technique in qualitative
studies, and has been described by Lincoln and Guba (1985, p. 314) as “the most critical
technique for establishing credibility ”. Member checking involves taking data, analyses,
interpretations and conclusions back to the participants so that they can judge the accuracy
of the account (Creswell, 2013). The aim is to enable participants check not only the accuracy
of the findings but also the language used. In practice, the researcher sent the university/
college librarians findings drawn from the interviews through e-mail so that they could
verify its accuracy. Reliability of some of the questionnaire items in this study were
determined by calculating Cronbach ’sαvalues of the variables in the questions. Cronbach ’s
αvalues were over 0.7 which shows that the items in the questionnaires used had high levels
of internal consistency (Nunnally, 1978).
Research ethics was accomplished by, among others, getting gate keepers ’permission
before entering the study sites, and soliciting the informed consent of the participants before
administering the questionnaires and conducting the interviews. Results of the study are
known only when the data are analysed. Being a mixed methods study, both qualitative and
quantitative data were collected that necessitated the use of different methods of analysis.
Data analysis in qualitative studies involves preparing and organising the data for analysis,
then reducing the data into themes through a process of coding and condensing the codesand finally representing the data in figures, tables or a discussion (Creswell, 2013).
The qualitative data collected from this study were first transcribed into MS Word and
cleaned. After transcription, the data were subjected to codification. The researcher
personally undertook both exercises although the latter was accomplished with the aid of
NVivo software. Use of NVivo did not only simplify the process of codification as large
volumes of data were collected in the five interviews conducted but also assisted in
achieving consistency. Codification assisted in deducing themes from the data. Conversely,
quantitative data were analysed using SPSS Version 23 to generate tables and graphs. SPSS
was chosen over other comparable software such as QDAP and QDA Miner because it
accommodates a wide range of research methods including mixed methods research which
was being deployed in this study. Moreover, SPSS is a widely used programme for
statistical analysis in the social sciences (Neuman, 2011).
Research delimitations and limitations
Although Malawi has four public universities, this study only focused on three of them.
Moreover, academic staff is another important user group of academic libraries. In this case,
findings reported in this paper only focus on students. This implies that library ’s readiness
to offer services through mobile phones to this group remains unknown hence may have to
be covered by future studies. Much as the study incorporated a quantitative strand in
addition to the qualitative one, it neither involved theory testing nor confirmation as is theLHT
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
case with other related studies. This implies that the two theories used in this study
(UTAUT and TOE) were not used in the strict sense, which is empirical at the core, but
rather to put the problem studied in the context of other related studies.
Findings and discussion
eReadiness of public university libraries in Malawi in terms of ICT infrastructure for the
adoption and use of mobile phones in providing library and information services
Availability of ICT infrastructure at the institutional level . ICT infrastructure plays a very
important role both in the delivery and access to library and information servicesthrough mobile phones. Therefore, the study sought to find out the availability of ICT
infrastructure at the institutional level which is critical for the offering of library and
information services through mobile phones by the libraries, and access to library
and information services through mobile phones by students. Findings indicated that all the
libraries studied that had most of the requisite ICT infrastructure to facilitate the offering oflibrary and information services through mobile phones save bandwidth which was
inadequate in all the institutions. The available ICT infrastructural resources available were
mainly internet infrastructure and ICT systems such as library management system (LMS),servers, tablet computers, desktop computers and fibre-optic backbone that facilitated
access to both wired and Wi-Fi internet access. Furthermore, the Polytechnic had an E2
Proxy Server which could facilitate remote access to e-resources.
Besides the ICT infrastructure, institutions studied had plans to acquire and install other
ICT-related infrastructure to facilitate the offering of library and information services
through mobile phones. The Polytechnic, for instance, was planning to install theUnstructured Supplementary Service Data SMS gateway to assist in the offering of the SMS
reference service. Conversely, MZUNI was hoping to acquire an electronic library and
e-granary which could potentially be offered on the mobile phone platform. LUANAR wasalso exploring the possibility of using cloud infrastructure to support ICT projects including
the offering of library and information services through mobile phone. Moreover, most of
the ICT equipment, which the institutions needed, save cloud infrastructure and wasavailable on the local market. This implies that the institutions in the current study could
easily acquire such type of infrastructure if they had financial resources.
Findings further revealed that although much of the required ICT infrastructure was
available, libraries in the institutions surveyed faced some challenges which could
negatively affect the offering of library and information services through mobile phones.Most notably, MZUNI indicated that it needed more desktop and tablet computers, and
servers with bigger capacity. KCN acknowledged using cheaper ICT equipment due to cost
considerations whilst COM conceded that some of the servers in use were old hence needed
to be replaced with more modern servers. Besides, all the institutions faced the challenge of
limited internet bandwidth in spite of various initiatives undertaken aimed at increasing
their bandwidth.
A number of case studies undertaken to probe projects aimed at delivering library and
information services through mobile phones (Li, 2013; Wang et al., 2012; Bridges et al., 2010)
have shown that libraries that were making use of mobile internet, SMS and MMS among
others in the delivery of both user and reference services needed a robust network
infrastructure, desktop and laptop comp uters, tablet PCs, an d more. Similarly,
the technological context of the TOE framework identifies all of the technologies that are
relevant to the ﬁrm (both at the firm level and outside the firm) as critical to technological
adoption (Baker, 2012). Furthermore, FC of the UTAUT model state that existence of thetechnical infrastructure to support the use of a particular system aids in technology
adoption and use (Venkatesh et al. , 2003). The fact that most of the required ICTeReadiness
of public

libraries
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
infrastructure was available in the study institutions suggests that they had built the
capacity necessary to support the offering of library and information services using the
mobile phone platform.
The availability, quality and affordability of the mobile telecommunications infrastructure
were investigated in the current study. This was deemed necessary because mobiletelecommunications network acts as a conduit for the offering of library and information
services on the mobile phone platform by public university libraries on one the hand, and
access to the service offering by students on the other. Findings showed that places where thestudy institutions were located had overall good mobile telecommunications network
coverage. There were reported incidents of erratic coverage for some buildings in certain
institutions but most reported having good coverage. Some of the respondents attributed thisto the setting indicating that urban areas where most of the study institutions were located
normally had good network coverage. However, LUANAR which was situated in a rural area
also reported having good mobile telecommunications network coverage which means that
most of the areas in the country could have good network coverage. These findings reflect
those of a study conducted by Nyirenda (2012) who found that Malawi had achieved a99.55 per cent land coverage of mobile cellular network by 2012. The implications of these
findings are that students in public universities in Malawi could use their mobile phones from
almost any part of the country. FC of the UTAUT model state that the existence of thetechnical infrastructure to support the use of a particular system facilitates technology
adoption and use (Venkatesh et al. , 2003). Availability of the mobile telecommunications
infrastructure in the country implies that public university libraries in Malawi were in aposition to provide library and information services through mobile phones as users
(students) could easily access such services using the mobile telecommunications network.
Although mobile telecommunications network coverage was good, findings of this study
found that the network performance was far from being efficient. Most of the university/
college librarians and ICT directors rated the network performance between 80 and 90 per cent.Some of the areas of concern to the respondents were mobile internet, SMS and even voice
calls. The technological context of the TOE framework states that technology or an innovation
is easily adopted if it is perceived to be better than the idea that it supersedes (Rogers, 2003).Therefore, issues affecting the performance of the mobile telecommunications network could
negatively impact the offering of library and information services through mobile phones if
they are not adequately addressed. Fi ndings made in relation to the mobile
telecommunications network reflect those obtained in the MACRA quality of service report
for the fourth quarter covering October to December 2015. The report, whilst applauding
operators for making progress in achieving network quality, pointed out that challenges inrelation to call setup success rate, call drop rate, SMS success rate, GPRS content activation
success rate and others still remained (MACRA, 2015).
Mobile phone ownership and use amongst students . The research findings show that
mobile phone ownership amongst students was very high with many of them owning one or
more devices. Findings shown in Figure 2 indicate that 315 (99.7 per cent) students owned amobile phone whilst only 1 (0.3 per cent) indicated that he or she did not own a mobile phone.
Whereas 215 (68.5 per cent) students indicated that they owned only one mobile phone,
a significant part of the student body (90, 28.7 per cent) indicated that they owned twomobile phones. Moreover, seven (2.2 per cent) students indicated that they owned three
mobile phones and only two (0.6 per cent) students pointed out that they owned more than
three mobile phones. These findings imply that much as single ownership of mobile phonewas prevalent, dual and multiple ownerships were increasingly becoming a trend.
This study has further revealed that 299 (94.9 per cent) students owned mobile phones
with internet capabilities whilst 16 (5.1 per cent) owned mobile phones without this capability.LHT
Downloaded by UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO LIBRARIES At 17:35 07 February 2018 (PT)
Students who owned more than one mobile phone were asked to indicate how many of
them had internet capabilities. A total of 48 (49 per cent) students stated that two of their
mobile phones had this capability whilst 46 (46.9 per cent) indicated that only one of theirphones had internet capabilities. Only four (4.1 per cent) had three or more mobile phones that
had internet capabilities.
The technological context of the TOE framework identifies technologies available both
to the firm and the market place as critical to technological adoption. The fact that students
owned mobile phones, most of which had internet capabilities, implies that libraries in this
study could easily adopt the use of mobile phones in providing library and information
services. This is because students who are the primary consumers of the service offering
have the means of accessing the services offered.
eReadiness of public university libraries in Malawi in terms of policy framework for the
adoption and use of mobile phones in providing library and information services
The findings of the present study indicated that all the five institutions surveyed did not have
operational ICT policies to govern the operations of library and information services currently
on offer and those to be potentially offered throu gh mobile phones. However, all the institutions
had draft ICT policies that were being refined in readiness for adoption and implementation.
KCN, COM and The Polytechnic are part of the federal system of UNIMA. Consequently,
the process of developing and implementing this policy was done centrally with the involvement
of stakeholders from al l these institutions. Surprisin gly, MZUNI and LUANAR seemed to have
been moving at a correspondingly slow pace in the development of the ICT policy in spite of
them being autonomous public institutions. The environmental context of the TOE framework
identifies the regulatory environment as on e of the factors that could impact technology
adoption both negatively or positively (Baker , 2012). The absence of the institutional ICT
policies would likely have a detrimental effect on the offering of library a nd information services
through mobile phones as there would be no unified approach to decision making in this regard.2159072

The slow pace observed in the development of the ICT policies in the institutions in this
study are not isolated cases but symptomatic of the challenges that exist at the national
level. Malawi adopted the National ICT Policy in the last quarter of 2013. The researcher
from the experience gained working in university library environment in Malawi observed
that most of the public university libraries operate without other relevant policy documents
such as selection and collection development policies which are necessary for providing an
effective library and information service.
Besides ICT policy, respondents indicated that their institutions were planning or had
developed other policies to promote access to library and information services. For example,
the UL for MZUNI indicated that the library had already developed an institutional
repository policy which they were hoping to implement alongside the ICT policy. The ICT
manager for LUANAR noted that though their draft ICT policy had some statements that
guided provision of library services, there was none to guide implementation of library and
information service offering through mobile phone platforms. The findings of the current
study also revealed that the majority of the respondents feared that the absence of the ICT
policy could have an adverse impact on the implementation of library and information
services offered through mobile phones. However, the CL for COM and ICT director for
LUANAR were of the opinion that absence of the policy would not have much impact on the
provision of library and information services offered through mobile phone platform as this
would be guided by their strategic plans.
Stueart and Moran (2002) point out that the advantage of a policy is that it helps in
ensuring consistency in decision making, particularly in an environment whereby several
decision makers exist. Considering that libraries have become complex organisational
structures with several layers of decision making at both managerial and operational levels,
as revealed in the libraries studied, it is important that policies be formulated to provide a
unified approach to decision making. The absence of ICT policies in the institutions may
lead to lack of consistency in decision making that may affect the overall quality of library
and information services delivered through mobile phones. However, the availability of
draft ICT policies in all the institutions surveyed gives hope that the final policy framework
would be completed in the near future to facilitate the implementation of library and
information services through mobile phones.
eReadiness of public university libraries in Malawi in terms of human capacity for the
adoption and use of mobile phones in providing library and information services
Library and ICT staff collaborates in the offering of library and information services
through mobile phone. However, findings obtained in the present study revealed a mixed
picture in relation to the human resource base available in public universities in Malawi to
manage the provision of library and information services through mobile phones. Most of
the libraries were adequately staffed but much of the staff lacked knowledge, skills and even
experience in the delivery of library and information services on the mobile phone platform.
The organisational component of the TOE framework recognises human resources as being
crucial for IT adoption. Therefore, the absence of skilled human resources could affect the
quality of library and information services offered through mobile phones if not addressed.
However, most of the ICT departments were not adequately staffed. Although some of the
ICT directors openly acknowledged the existence of the staff shortages, others downplayed
the issues of staffing. The problem of staff shortages meant that the ICT departments were
struggling to service departments that required their services including the library.
The implementation of library and information services through mobile phones might pile
more pressure on the ICT existing staff. Nonetheless, most of the ICT staff had the requisite
skills to enable them support the provision of library and information services through
mobile phones as only minor cases of skill gaps were reported.LHT

Human resource capacity is an important elem ent for determining the preparedness of a
library with respect to the delivery of services t hrough mobile phones. Projects undertaken at
the Kimbel Library of the Coastal Carolina Univers ity (Felts, 2014), Ryers on University Library
(Wilson and McCarthy, 2010) and Oregon State University Library (Bridges et al. , 2010)
on offering library services through mobile phone show that joint teams of experts that include
professional librarians and ICT personnel a re needed to work together in overseeing the
successful implementation of such projects. As overall managers o f the whole project, the role of
librarians was to determine the services and content to be displayed on the mobile websites after
soliciting views of users, and assess the use of th e project after implementation. The role of the
ICT team was to offer technical support in ter ms of building the website and managing it.
Likewise, the presence of librarians and technica l staff in the study institutions, many of whom
were conversant with the offering of library and information services on the mobile phone
platform, denotes that the various institut ions in the current study had the necessary human
resources to enable them offer library and information services through mobile phones.
Barnhart and Pierce (2011) in their thematic paper titled “Becoming mobile: reference in the
ubiquitous library ”identify staf ﬁng for offering services 24/7 as one of the challenges libraries
face in their bid to offer library services throug h mobile phone. Instituti o n si nt h i ss t u d yw o u l d
similarly face this challenge as they offer library and information services on the mobile phone
platform hence more staff need to be recruited b oth in the library and ICT departments to ensure
that they cope with the added workload that ma y come with the introduction of these services.
Attitudes of library staff and students towards the potential use of mobile
phones in providing and accessing library and information services
The study findings based on the interviews conducted with university/college librarians
show that the attitudes of library staff and students towards the potential use of mobile
phones in providing and accessing library and information services were largely positive.
The only exception was the KCN whereby findings showed that students did not show
greater willingness to use their mobile phones to access library services when the library
piloted the SMS project in 2014. However, even non-use of the service is not enough to
interpret their attitudes as being negative as no studies were conducted to ascertain reasons
for the failure of the students to use the service. The findings of this study indicated that the
poor response of the students to the pilot SMS project had not deterred the KCN Library
from proceeding with its plans of offering library services through mobile phones.
Findings based on the survey presented in Figure 3 show that the majority of the students
either strongly agreed (143, 45 per cent) or agreed (144, 46 per cent) that the library shouldformalise the provision of services through the use of mobile phones. On the contrary,
20 (6 per cent) students neither agreed nor disagreed, five (2 per cent) disagreed whilst three
(1 per cent) strongly disagreed that the library should formalise the provision of services
through the use of mobile phones. This shows that majority of the students (287, 91 per cent)
were in favour of the library adopting the provision of services through mobile phones.
Student respondents who were in favour of the library formalising the provision of
library and information services through mobile phones were asked to indicate the services
they wished to be prioritised. An analysis of their responses shown in Table I indicate that
175 (57.9 per cent) students strongly wanted to access e-books, 172 (57.0 per cent) e-journals,
151 (50.0 per cent) OPAC, 139 (46.0 per cent) reference services, 124 (41.1 per cent) lending
services (overdue reminders, book renewals, etc.) and 121 (40.1 per cent) information
services (notification of recent acquisitions, change of opening hours and news). Slightly
fewer students (119, 39.4 per cent) wanted to be able to check availability of short loan items
and make reservations/bookings and 105 (34.8 per cent) wanted user awareness or
information literacy offerings. Very few (65, 21.5 per cent) wanted to be able to carry out
inter-library loan transactions.eReadiness

Findings of a number of other studies have similarly shown students to exhibit positive
attitudes about the use of mobile phones in the delivery and access to library and
information services through mobile phones. Kumar (2014), for instance, conducted a study
that involved 180 students at Jawaharlal Nehru University in India. Findings of the study
revealed that 89.44 per cent of the respondents did not have problems if the library reached
out to them through mobile phone. This figure was slightly higher than that recorded in the

current study (87 per cent). In yet another study, Walsh (2010) conducted a series of focus
groups in 2009 at the University of Huddersfield to study student attitudes about the use of
mobile phones in libraries. Findings indicated that student attitudes towards text
messaging from the library were overwhelmingly positive.
Factors that influence the adoption and use of mobile phones by library staff
and students, respectively, in providing and accessing library andinformation services
Findings resulting from data collected from university/college librarians and ICT directors
indicated that there were some factors that could have a bearing on the offering of library
and information services on the mobile phone platform. These include: periodic disruption of
internet services due to vandalism of fibre-optic cables experienced by the service providers;
the network may get congested due to increased usage brought about by the introduction of
library and information services through mobile phones; the hustle of registering clients ’
mobile phone numbers into the database; and high cost of accessing services through mobile
phone by students. The high-cost mobile phone services made most of the institutions to
focus on investing in Wi-Fi infrastructure to enable students connect their mobile phones to
the campus network so that they can access library and information services through
mobile phones. MZUNI was also planning to preload information in tablets that it was
planning to acquire as a means of overcoming the high cost of accessing the planned library
and information services through mobile phones.
Findings of the current study further indicated that the majority of the students
(255, 80.9 per cent) either strongly agreed (128, 40.6 per cent) or agreed (127, 40.3 per cent)
that poor network quality is a factor they would face in using mobile phones in accessing
library and information services through the use of mobile phones. The rest of the students
(60, 19 per cent) neither agreed nor disagreed (35, 11.1 per cent), disagreed (23, 7.3 per cent)
or strongly disagreed (2, 0.6 per cent) that poor network quality was a factor they would face
in using mobile phones to access library and information services through mobile phone.
High service costs, delayed response and query not adequately addressed are some of the
notable factors which students identified as likely to impact their use of mobile phones in
accessing library services. These findings are presented in Table II.
The (Dahlstrom et al. , 2015) study of undergraduate students ’ownership and use of
mobile devices in the USA indicated that students living on campus rated their network
experiences considerably lower than students living off-campus whereby only three in
five students stated that they had reliable access to Wi-Fi throughout their campus
(58 per cent) or in classrooms/instruct ional spaces (63 per cent) (Dahlstrom et al. , 2015).
This challenge came about mainly because of a large number of mobile devices which
students connected to the campus network as 61 per cent of students connected at leasttwo devices to the campus network at the same time. Likewise, a study conducted by
Research ICT Solutions (2015) found that call tariffs were still higher in Malawi compared
to neighbouring countries although they had gone down over the years. The technological
context of the TOE framework also identifies c ost as a factor in technology adoption and
use (Baker, 2012). The high cost of mobile phone services in Malawi and poor network
quality could impact negatively the offering library and information services through
mobile phones.
Conclusions and recommendations
Findings indicated that public university libraries in Malawi possessed the LMS, servers,
tablet computers, desktop computers and Wi-Fi. Moreover, students had mobile phones
many of which had internet capabilities. It is, therefore, concluded that the institutionseReadiness

studied had the ICT infrastructure necessary for offering and accessing library and
information services on the mobile phone platform.
The findings indicated that all the five institutions covered by this study did not have
operational ICT policies to govern the operations of library and information services offered
via the mobile phone platform. However, all the institutions had draft ICT policies that were
being refined in readiness for adoption and implementation. It is, therefore, concluded that
the absence of ICT policies in the institutions in this study may affect the overall quality of
library and information services delivered through mobile phones.
The study findings revealed a mixed pi cture in relation to the human resources
available to manage the provision of libra ry and information services through mobile
phones in the institutions in this study. Whils t the libraries were adequately staffed, the
ICT departments were not. Addi tionally, most of the library s taff lacked knowledge, skills
and even experience in the delivery of library and information services through mobile
phones. In light of these findings, it is concluded that though the human resource required
to manage the provision of library and information services through mobile phones in the
institutions studied were available, they d id not have the necessary skills and numbers to
provide quality library and information services through mobile phones.
Findings revealed that the attitudes of library staff and students towards the potential
use of mobile phones in providing and accessing library and information services were
largely positive. The perceived positive attitudes of library staff and students towards
the use of mobile phones in the delivery of library and information services could lead to the
success of the service offering on this platform.
High service costs and poor network quality were identified as the main factors that
could affect the offering of library and information services through mobile phones.
Public university libraries in Malawi need to find ways of overcoming these challenges if
they were to successfully offer services using mobile phones.
The overall conclusion from this study, therefore, is that public university libraries in
Malawi were generally e-ready to offer library and information services through mobileFactorsStrongly

phones notwithstanding certain infrastructure, policy and skills issues that must be
addressed. In light of these findings, university/college librarians are urged to take steps to
address issues that may negatively impact the delivery of library and information services
through mobile phones. Specifically, action needs to be taken to ensure that draft ICT policies
are finalised and adopted for use. Human resources and skills gaps observed should equally
be addressed. Issues observed in relation to ICT infrastructure such as network performance
also need to be addressed to ensure efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery.

Digitalization and Digital Literacy in Indonesia
The number of Internet users in Indonesia has increased significantly in recent years. Between 2015 and 2019, 
Internet users increased by 22%. In 2019, 43.5% of the 270 million people in Indonesia had access to the Internet 
(Statistics Indonesia, 2020a). While the greatest increase comes from people living in urban areas, where the 
number of users increased by 53%, rural areas have also experienced a steady rise, increasing by 31%. 
Young people have also enjoyed increasing access to the Internet. In the past four years, the percentage of 
Indonesian students aged 5–24 years who have access to the Internet increased sharply from 33.98% to 59.3% 
(Statistics Indonesia, 2020b) (Graph 1). Slightly more than a quarter of Internet users (25.5%) are children and 
adolescents. • To strengthen students’ digital literacy, the 
Ministry of Education and Culture and the 
Ministry of Religious  Affairs need to improve the 
curriculum for teaching ICT. This requires the 
participation of the Ministry of Communications 
and Informatics and non-government actors 
with special expertise in digital solutions. It has 
to apply a new approach of cultivating critical 
thinking skills in the classroom, improving 
teachers’ capacities in both ICT and critical 
thinking, and introducing basic digital literacy 
skills for parents. • The Ministry of Education and Culture, and 
the Ministry of Religious Affairs need to 
cooperate with the Ministry of Communication 
and Informatics on expanding technology and 
Internet access, especially for students living 
in rural areas. This requires the cooperation of 
the private sector.

Digital activity has also surged. A survey conducted by Hootsuite and We are Social (2021) reveals that Indonesian 
respondents aged 16-64 years old spend an average of 7 hours and 52 minutes on the Internet every day. This is 
higher than the global average of 6 hours and 54 minutes per day. Indonesia ranks 8th out of 42 surveyed countries 
in terms of most time spent on the Internet, higher than Singapore and Vietnam and lower than the Philippines 
and Malaysia. 
Children are also well engaged on the Internet, especially in social media. Focus group interviews in Cambodia, 
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand conducted by UNICEF (2020) found that many children manage multiple social 
media accounts for entertainment, communication, and education purposes. Some of them are not only consumers 
but also content creators.
During the Covid-19 pandemic, digital activities have expanded and intensified as many people have had to shift 
to online solutions. For example, new digital consumers in e-commerce in Indonesia increased as much as 37% 
during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 (Google et al., 2020; Ministry of Trade, 2020). Due to long-term school 
closures, educational activity has also shifted online, especially in urban areas. As a result, children are exposed 
to an expanded range of digital content and products and become a more important segment of online consumers. 
However, the remarkable growth of Internet use in Indonesia has not necessarily corresponded with improved 
digital literacy. This refers not only to the ability to use technology, such as skills to use devices, software and 
the basic use of the Internet. It also includes digital literacy skills that revolve around the ability to understand, 
evaluate, and responsibly use information acquired from digital sources, which is the subject of this policy brief. 
Considering the premature development of digital literacy in Indonesia, this brief will not engage in a discussion 
of more advanced levels of digital literacy that require an understanding of cybersecurity, digital citizenship, data 
privacy, etc.
According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (2020a), Indonesia ranks 61st out of 100 countries for its level of 
education and preparedness to use the Internet. Indonesia’s position is lower than neighboring countries such 
as Singapore and Malaysia, which rank 22nd and 33rd, respectively. The low level of digital literacy in Indonesia, 
especially in rural areas, limits what Internet users can meaningfully do when they are online and may exacerbate 
the digital divide1 (Purbo, 2017).

to information and communication technology (ICT) resources and their use of the Internet for any purposes. Source: Statistics Indonesia (2020b).Figure 1.

The Urgency of Digital Literacy Improvement
As Internet use pervades every aspect of life, the urgency of improving digital literacy increases. This includes 
improving understanding of how to use digital products in a responsible manner and taking advantage of 
opportunities and resources available on the Internet. There is wide agreement that users must be equipped with 
the skills needed to maximize the benefits from their online activities (Purbo, 2017). Building these skills can 
begin at a young age, especially when children are already exposed to the Internet.
Children are quite agile in their technology use, but this does not necessarily translate to maturity in content 
consumption and engagement. Many online platforms are not designed for children and there are hardly any 
barriers to prevent their accessing inappropriate content. Without a thorough understanding of digital literacy, 
children may be susceptible to online threats and harmful content including hoaxes and misinformation, 
cyberbullying, online fraud, and even sexual exploitation. 
Awareness of hoaxes and misinformation is especially relevant in light of the societal threats posed by populist 
and radical internet content that can threaten democratic norms and institutions. As future voters, citizens, and 
political participants, children must be prepared to confront and recognize dangerous and misleading content 
and sources. 
In addition to preventing immediate online harm, acquiring digital literacy at an early age prepares children to 
become consumers of online goods and services. In the interest of future consumer protection, children should 
be equipped with the ability to critically assess online terms and conditions and understand consumer rights, and 
data privacy. The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index ( Indeks Keberdayaan Konsumen/IKK ) stood at 41.70 
in 2019.2 This score indicates that Indonesian consumers understand their role but are not yet critical in terms of 
using their rights and obligations (Ministry of Trade, 2020). Improving digital literacy among children can help to 
improve performance on this index in the future.
Digital literacy is also important because it opens the door to employment opportunities and facilitates the 
mastery of other essential skills (Karpati, 2011). Digitalization constantly creates and transforms jobs throughout 
the labor market. Digital literacy skills give students the ability to thrive in this dynamic digital environment. 
The Personal Data Protection Bill ( Rancangan Undang-Undang Perlindungan Data Pribadi/RUU PDP ) under 
development in the Indonesian House of Representatives considers introducing a minimum age of 17 years for 
setting up a social media account without parental consent (Sari, 2020). This policy is intended to protect children 
from harmful internet content, but it will have the effect of reducing opportunities to build digital literacy that will 
allow them to innovate and thrive in the modern world. Equipping children with digital literacy will help them to 
be digitally resilient, to make responsible decisions, and to optimize the benefits of spending their time online. 
2 The Indonesian Consumer Empowerment Index (IKK) measures consumers’ ability to empower themselves. The IKK index is grouped into 5 scoring 
systems: 1. Aware—recognize their rights and obligations as consumers (0.0–20.0); 2. Understand—understand their rights and obligations to protect 
themselves (20.01–40.0); 3. Capable—able to decide the best choices as consumers and prioritize local products (40.1–60.0); 4. Critical—actively defend 
their rights and prioritize local products (60.1–80.0); 5. Empowered—actively defending consumers’ interest in interacting with the market (80.1–100.0).5
Teaching Digital Literacy Skills in Indonesia 
Digital literacy is strongly dependent on basic literacy skills—reading and writing comprehension. Unfortunately, 
Indonesia consistently performs poorly in literacy. Fifteen-year-old Indonesian students surveyed in the 
Programme for International Students Assessment (PISA) 2018 ranked 71st out of 79 countries. Only 30% 
demonstrated at least level 2 proficiency3 in reading, compared to the OECD average of 77% (OECD, 2019). On 
the other hand, 70% of Indonesian adults living in Jakarta perform at or below level 1 in literacy, according to the 
Survey of Adult Skills (PIIAC) (OECD, 2016). These surveys highlight that, while the majority of Indonesians can 
understand simple texts using basic vocabulary, they have difficulty understanding and critically evaluating long 
and complex texts. 
A contributing factor toward low literacy levels is the lack of emphasis on critical thinking skills in the school 
curriculum. The National Curriculum 2013 mandates the implementation of High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) 
but it is not well-integrated into or widely taught during teacher training in Indonesia (Ilyas, 2015). In practice, 
Indonesian education focuses on older approaches to learning, such as memorization (WENR, 2019; UNICEF, 
2017).
In addition to the problems of low literacy and poor critical thinking skills in the general population, digital 
literacy education is largely missing from Indonesian schools. Information and Communication Technology 
(ICT) was included as a compulsory subject in the National Curriculum 2006 (also known as Kurikulum Tingkat 
Satuan Pendidikan  or KTSP), but content was limited to basic skills such as how to use a computer, computer 
applications, and devices to support study activities. In 2013, the Ministry of Education removed ICT from the list 
of compulsory subjects in the National Curriculum 2013 with the intention of integrating ICT learning across all 
school subjects (Bona, 2018). However, many public schools responded by dropping the subject altogether (Purbo, 
2017). Teachers of other subjects were unable to incorporate ICT into their lesson plans because their own ICT 
skills and knowledge were insufficient, whereas ICT teachers were confused by the removal of the subject from 
the National Curriculum 2013 (Subekti, Yudha, & Luqman 2016). As a result, many Indonesian students have 
received no education in ICT.
The inequality of Internet access across the different regions of Indonesia and the socioeconomic conditions of 
Indonesians are the major structural challenges for the improvement of digital literacy. First, the percentage of 
households that can access the Internet is the highest on the most densely populated island of Java while it is 
much lower in the eastern parts of Indonesia (Statistics Indonesia, 2019b), as illustrated in Figure 2. 
3 PISA 2018 has a scale of 1–6 to indicate reading proficiency. The scale 1 consists of 1a, 1b, 1c, indicating the proficiency of understanding simple text 
with literal meaning. Scale 2 indicates the ability to identify the meaning of moderate-length text. Scale 3 indicates the ability to understand multiple texts. 
Scale 4 students can understand indirect cues and nuances in a single or multiple texts. Scale 5 students are able to compare the meaning of multiple, 
lengthy texts. Scale 6 indicates the ability to understand long and abstract texts and use multiple criteria to validate the information. 6
Source: Statistics Indonesia (2019b)Figure 2. 
Internet Access (percent) per Household by Province in Indonesia (2019). 
Internet users are predominantly households with higher incomes. They are more likely to afford and access 
devices and internet subscriptions (Bachtiar et al., 2020). Lack of Internet access is strongly linked to low levels of 
digital literacy. Inexperienced users are unlikely to be as competent or resilient as those who use the Internet on a 
daily basis. Expanding access, especially to disadvantaged communities, is crucial for digital literacy improvement.
The inequality of access is also visible in the education sector. According to Statistics Indonesia (2018), only 
69% of primary and junior secondary schools and 74% of senior secondary schools have access to the Internet. 
This results in low and widely varying levels of ICT competence and digital literacy among Indonesian teachers 
(Widodo & Riandi, 2013 cited in Koh et al., 2018). DKI Jakarta

Current Efforts to Mainstream Digital Literacy in 
Indonesia
Improving digital literacy is one of five priorities in the government’s plan to accelerate the digital transformation 
in Indonesia (Cabinet Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020). However, there is no solid set of policies or 
clearly targeted outcomes related to digital literacy (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2020b).
Efforts to increase digital literacy start from the basic level of increasing general literacy by nurturing the ability 
to understand, interpret, create, and communicate texts. They must also involve critical thinking skills and the 
ability to critically observe, analyse and interpret information and the logical connection between ideas, to support 
rational individual decision-making processes. Finally, and following a more specific definition of digital literacy, 
they require the ability to find, evaluate, use and create content on digital platforms.
Dealing with such a complex set of necessary skills involves programs and activities spread across government 
agencies. In Indonesia, this includes the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Religious Affairs as well 
as the Ministry of Communication and Informatics. 
In order to promote general literacy, the government has initiated programs such as the National Literacy 
Movement (Gerakan Literasi Nasional/GLN), established by the Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) in 2016. 
It includes the promotion of literacy in three areas: literacy in schools (Gerakan Literasi Sekolah/GLS), family 
(Gerakan Literasi Keluarga/GLK), and society (Gerakan Literasi Masyarakat/GLM). GLN was mandated through 
MOEC Regulation No. 23/2015 on Developing Character on Students with the purpose of synchronizing all literacy 
programs that have been running in each MOEC directorate and expanding public involvement in the development 
of literacy culture in Indonesia. The main focus on this movement is to cultivate reading habits of students.  
The GLN guidelines also addresses digital literacy and defines it as the skills to make use of information from 
digital sources in an accountable manner. It includes the aim of developing digital learning habits and improving 
the use of digital media in school education (GLN, 2017), but it does not seek to increase the skills to critically 
analyze and navigate digital sources. The evaluation of digital literacy according to the GLN guidelines merely 
assesses whether stakeholders have integrated digital sources and media in the learning process and their daily      
life (MOEC, 2017). 
Several MOEC regulations are of relevance in this context. Increasing digital literacy is not being directly 
addressed in the National Education Standards4, but critical thinking skills are included. MOEC Regulation No. 
20/2016 specified them as the basic competency standard required for primary and secondary school graduates. 
MOEC Regulation No. 21/2016 on the Standard of Content for Primary and Secondary Education also mentioned 
critical thinking skills as one of the indicators for mastering school subjects.   
While MOEC Regulation No. 22/2016 on the Standardized Process of Primary and Secondary Schools demands 
that the learning process must include activities of observing, questioning, and analysing, which are essentially 
critical thinking skills, these skills have not become an indicator to assess students’ competence in MOEC 
Regulation No. 23/2016 on the Education Assessment Standard.
4 National Education Standards are the minimum standards in Indonesia’s education system. They consist of eight standards: 1). Standard of content; 2). 
Standard of process; 3). Graduate competence standard; 4). Teachers and educational personnel standard; 5). Standard of facilities and infrastructure; 
6). Management standards; 7). Financing standards; 8). Educational assessment standards.8
A basic level of digital literacy training addresses the technical competence to use digital devices and software. In 
that regard, MOEC Regulation No. 37/20185 reintroduced ICT as an optional subject at the primary school level and 
made it a compulsory subject for junior and secondary middle schools (SMP/SMA) beginning in the 2019 academic 
year. However, deficiencies of the ICT curriculum with respect to digital literacy remain. The curriculum puts a 
strong focus on understanding and improving technical competence in areas such as programming, using office 
applications, and writing blog posts, while there is insufficient emphasis on how to responsibly and critically use 
these technologies.  The national curriculum has to be based on the National Education Standards, which include 
critical thinking skills. However, MOEC Regulation No. 37/2018MOEC does not integrate critical thinking skills in 
the ICT subject.  
For the schools under the Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) such as Madrasah6, MORA Regulation No. 184/2019 
on Guideline of Curriculum Implementation in Madrasah has yet to include digital literacy in the curriculum. The 
subject that seems most suitable to convey digital literacy is informatics ( informatika ), but it is an optional and not 
a mandatory subject on junior and senior secondary levels of Madrasah. It is not offered on the primary education 
level. As for other institutions of Islamic education, such as Pesantren ,7 the curriculum is designed by the Kyai or 
prominent figures in the institution without the intervention of MORA (Azzahra, 2020). Pesantren  may teach ICT 
skills, but the exact number of pesantren  teaching ICT remains unknown. Most Pesantren  are traditional by nature 
anyway and unlikely to address digital technologies. There is no information available on how many Pesantren  are 
equipped with necessary facilities such as Internet and computers.   
Despite the lacking focus on digital literacy skills in the national curriculum, some schools, especially those 
operated by the private sector, have integrated digital literacy in advanced ICT classes. They go beyond the 
national curriculum requirements, when they teach 21st century skills such as digital citizenship, critical thinking 
and problem solving (Sampoerna Academy, n.d; British School Jakarta, n.d). Still, this will only be accessible 
for students from upper-income families. Most schools in Indonesia are not equipped with digital facilities and 
lack the human resources to teach students digital literacy and not just the functionalities of digital devices. 
Mainstreaming digital literacy must, therefore, go beyond the initiatives of individual schools and requires 
significant support from the government. 
More specifically addressing digital literacy, Ministry of Communication and Informatics (MOCI) initiated the 
National Digital Literacy Movement ( Gerakan Nasional Literasi Digital  or Siberkreasi ) to improve digital literacy 
skills in Indonesia. Siberkreasi is a multi-stakeholder initiative aimed at reducing misinformation and negative 
contents on the Internet through public awareness activities by private businesses, civil society organizations, 
etc.  As part of the movement, MOCI also provides online references and digital sources through the website 
literasidigital.id in the form of videos, articles, and e-books on digital literacy. It also encourages the government 
to include digital literacy in the school curriculum (MOCI, 2019a). 
As of 2019, 20,472 people had participated in offline Siberkreasi  programs, including seminars, workshops, and 
talk shows in 25 provinces. Audiences included both students and adults (MOCI, 2019b).  
5 This policy brief specifically addresses the curriculum after the ICT subject has been reintroduced
6 Madrasah is an Islamic education institution that teaches the national curriculum and uses methods similar to formal schools but also incorporate 
weekly hours of Islamic instructions. Madrasah are found on all levels of school education: primary (Madrasah Ibtidaiyah/MI), junior secondary 
(Madrasah Tsanawiyah/MTs), and senior secondary (Madrasah Aliyah/MA)
7 Pesantren  is a culturally-rooted Islamic educational institution in Indonesia characterized by its boarding school element and traditional method of 
teaching Islamic theological materials. 9
However, the scope of this program remains limited and it is unknown whether it has improved digital literacy. 
There is no program evaluation incorporated into Siberkreasi  and digital literacy has not yet been added to the 
school curriculum. 
In 2021, MOCI and its Siberkreasi  partners plan to publish a Digital Literacy Module 2021-2024 which covers four 
aspects of digital literacy, namely digital skills, digital safety, digital ethics, and digital culture.8 This module is 
supposed to provide practical tips on improving digital literacy skills. There will also be equipped with evaluation 
parts in every chapter to assess users’ understanding. 
8 The module is yet to behad not been published during the at the time of writing  process of this policy brief10
Policy Recommendations
• Create a comprehensive inter-ministerial 
framework for digital literacy
 MOCI and MOEC have cooperated in organizing 
events on digital literacy, however, despite 
the fact that both address the improvement of 
digital literacy, the National Literacy Movement 
and Siberkreasi  are largely separated from one 
another. There is a need to streamline efforts in 
a comprehensive inter-ministerial framework.  
• Improve digital literacy education in the school 
curriculum
 As ICT education was reintroduced in schools 
in 2019, MOEC and MORA should adjust the 
curriculum to fit the demands of the digital age. 
Students must be prepared to be responsible 
and literate digital citizens and consumers. 
The curriculum should prioritize cultivating the 
ethical and responsible use of technology as 
well as navigating myriad information in the 
digital settings.
 The curriculum should prioritize responsible 
information use and sharing, identification 
of trustworthy sources of information, and 
protecting students during their online activity. 
These skills are more relevant than the dated 
ICT content in the curriculum.
 Teaching material must be simplified and 
adjusted to the specific age groups in school, 
while also involving parents to guide and 
support their children in online activities. 
• Cultivate critical thinking across all school 
subjects
 Critical thinking skills are a crucial prerequisite 
to improving digital literacy. Critical thinking 
is necessary for understanding and verifying 
information from online sources. In developed 
countries such as Finland and Switzerland, 
critical thinking is an integral aspect of 
education. MOEC and MORA should rethink and 
provide guidance on how to better integrate 
critical thinking skills across all learning 
activities, while learning lessons from the 
shortcomings of this strategy for ICT education. 
Practices such as working collaboratively with 
peers, using HOTS content and questions for 
assignments and exams, and cultivating a 
habit of questioning, analyzing, and crafting 
arguments in discussion should be part of every 
classroom. • Include digital literacy and critical thinking in 
teachers’ training
 Digital literacy materials should be included in 
teachers’ training. Without improving the low 
overall ICT competence and critical thinking 
pedagogy among teachers, they will not be able 
to play their part in improving the digital literacy 
of students.   
• Equipping the parents with basic digital 
literacy skills
 Developing responsible online behavior starts 
at home. To be able to supervise the online 
activities of their children, parents must 
themselves know how to navigate social media, 
find reliable news, and critically assess the 
content. Parents need to have basic digital 
literacy skills because they are also not immune 
to digital threats. MOCI’s Siberkreasi  needs to 
create training modules and offer courses that 
target parents. 
• Cooperating with the private sector to 
formulate relevant curriculum content 
 The digital space is dynamic and ever-changing. 
The education sector has difficulty keeping up. In 
order to improve the dynamics of digital literacy 
education, MOEC and MORA should coordinate 
with MOCI and engage in partnerships with 
private sector experts. The private sector has 
been engaged in public seminars and talk 
shows through MOCI’s Siberkreasi  program, but 
not in improving the school curriculum. These 
external experts can help the government to 
formulate relevant indicators for the digital 
literacy contents skills in the school curriculum. 
• Improving access of technology to support 
digital inclusion
 Improving Internet access and technology, 
especially in rural parts of Indonesia, should 
remain a government priority in order to address 
the digital disparity and open up opportunities 
for disadvantaged families. MOCI is planning 
to equip about 12,000 villages with Internet 
access. Private sector involvement, which has 
been considered, should be encouraged. MOEC 
and MORA should also cooperate with the 
private sector to equip schools, especially in 
rural areas, with Internet access, laptops, and 
computers.11

APPENDIX: UNESCO's work on media and gender ………………………………… 154FOREWORD
It is sometimes said that talk is cheap, and that what really counts is action. 
But words are not always cheap. People often pay a high personal cost for what they 
say – including when they dare to speak out in favour of gender equality.
Such high-cost speech is especially valuable in the face of other kinds of speech, 
which are unfortunately increasingly common, where words (and images) incite and 
normalise discrimination and violence against women and girls. 
This is why the Position Papers in this book dealing with key policy issues are so vital. 
They constitute brave statements in a difficult climate. Every voice in favour of gender 
equality matters, and the ones featured here have the power to help change society. 
Even without action, words are key components for progressive norms. Without them 
there is no beacon for policy to aspire to, nor a standard to use for assessing practice. 
The contributions to this book help precisely to illuminate the beacon we need. They 
signal how we can benchmark what is happening on the ground.
To the extent that the words in these Position Papers also serve a purpose of “preaching 
to the converted”, let’s recall that it is always important to strengthen morale. And at the 
same time, the contents in these pages go further than inspiration and reinforcement.
The contributors systematically, and holistically, unpack a range of dimensions – each 
and every one of which is relevant to the quest for Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) 5 for the world to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls”. 
The deadline for humanity to get to this milestone is 2030, and much remains to be 
done.This is why UNESCO continues to champion gender equality as a global priority in all 
its work. It is also why the Organization’s specialised media development programme, 
the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC), has co-
funded the production of this book.
It was under the leadership of the then IPDC Chair, Albana Shala, in 2017, that funds 
were allocated via a financial contribution from The Netherlands. That support led 
to an international joining of forces inside the Global Alliance for Media and Gender 
(GAMAG) to identify the topics and commission the experts to deliver the Position 
Papers. GAMAG is the result of an initiative of UNESCO that now has a life of its own. 
See gamag.net
In producing the contents of this book, many of the authors took part in sessions at 
the Commission on the Status of Women at the UN General Assembly in March 2018. 
Besides impacting on the talks and their outcomes, the collective also convened a 
special panel to present their drafts and gain peer feedback.
The Position Papers that now see the light of day show us how to tackle the gaps between 
fine-sounding policies and actual practices, between words and implementation.
What they show is that if implementation is flawed, then there may have been flaws 
in the basic policy – due inter alia to knowledge gaps that led to substantive obstacles 
being overlooked. This insight, along with others in the Papers, helps us to bridge talk 
with action.
This is because we have here a resource that unpacks the complexity and thereby allows 
for strategic policies and programmes to be effective in advancing gender equality in 
media and through media (including social media). Governments, companies, NGOs, 
academia, individuals all have a huge contribution to make – together and in the space 
of their own efficacy. No single actor can do it alone in these digital times. For its part, 
UNESCO has undertaken many actions to support the quest for gender equality in and 
through media (see Appendix to this book). Amongst other initiatives, UNESCO created 
1and has promoted worldwide the Gender Sensitive-Indicators for Media (GSIM) to help 
produce knowledge for change.
A significant step was taken in 2018 when the IPDC gave the green light to new 
UNESCO indicators to assess the Internet. This is a framework with strong gender 
considerations throughout.
Called the Internet Universality Indicators (IUIs), this framework complements the 
Position Papers here. It opens up the doors for gender-sensitive analysis, on a per 
country-basis, of the most influential communications facility of our era.
In this way, both the Position Papers, the GSIM and the IUIs hold the promise to 
empower us to understand fast-moving digital developments.
Together, they can provide the knowledge for words to be a springboard for action. 
For designing information and communications policies that work – for governments, 
in companies and other institutions, and even for and by individuals.
Policies that help to realize SDG 5 – and SDG 16 target 10 which calls for “public access 
to information and fundamental freedoms”.
This is our opportunity to help ensure gender equality in public access to information 
and fundamental freedoms. If we fail, sustainable development fails.

2PREFACE
 The global media landscape has evolved dramatically in the more than twenty 
years since the Fourth UN World Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995) was held, 
when media were recognized as critical for the advancement of women and 
the achievement of equality between women and men.1 Section J of the Beijing 
Platform for Action underlined several issues, among them, gender bias in media 
organisations, degrading and suggestive pornographic media images of women, and 
the unexploited potential of information technology for women’s progress. At the 
time, less than one percent of the world’s population was online, while presently, 
approximately 50 percent2 have access to the Internet. Of these, three quarters 
are active on social media platforms3 that have emerged since the beginning of the 
millennium. Seven out of 10 people4 today own a cell phone capable of transmitting 
instant messages or connecting to the Internet. Online media content reproduces 
the exclusion and ghettoization of women – characteristic of traditional media forms 
– within the media product and in the comments and responses of new interactive 
audiences.5 While the number of women working in media and communications has 
increased more broadly, their presence in top management remains negligible. For 
instance, only six of the 100 largest international media corporations in the world 
had female CEOs in 2017.6
 Since the dimensions of the women and media experience were reflected in the 
Beijing Platform, transformations, and corresponding and emerging gender issues

3of the last two decades make it important to take stock and suggest a way forward if 
intervention strategies on media and information and communication technologies 
(ICTs) are to be relevant. Thus the position papers in this collection, which emerged 
out of conversations on the need to update the issues arising since Beijing, while at 
the same time make a case for the centrality of media and ICTs for gender equality 
and women’s rights’ struggles. That the Commission on the Status of Women 
resolved to discuss the media and ICTs theme at its 62nd session (CSW 2018) made 
the development of these papers even more pertinent. 
 Organised in four sections, the papers present the salient issues respective to 
the facet under discussion, the evidence on progress, persistent gaps and emerging 
concerns, good practice examples, and authors' recommendations directed primarily 
at media organisations and relevant State bodies.
 Rooted in holistic and intersectional principles, the papers provide ideas for 
various stakeholders to respond to urgent needs. These include research to inform 
policy; promoting regulatory and auto-regulatory mechanisms at national, regional 
and international levels, implementing frameworks for algorithmic transparency, 
incorporating methods such as third party audits, promoting media and digital 
literacy programmes with a gender component that specifically focuses on building 
the information and media literacy of women and girls, and encouraging efforts 
by women’s organisations in using digital media and online spaces to amplify their 
stories ensuring safe conditions for women journalists and professionals in media 
and telecommunications corporations and organisations, and tackling online and 
offline gender-based harassment and violence, and immunity from the law. 
 Section I considers media policy, structures and employment. Padovani argues 
that despite prescriptions since Beijing for media policies that empower women and 
normative frameworks for gender equality in the media, recommendations to review 
existing policies and to strengthen self-regulatory mechanisms and codes of conduct 
are still not a priority for governments, media companies, international organizations 
and the research community. Tracing the legacy of policy-related recommendations, 
4the paper provides theoretical insights and operational inputs towards making policy 
development a priority. Byerly contributes an analysis on gender representation on 
boards of some media conglomerates around the world to conclude that women 
are peripheral to control of and benefit from the world’s communication companies. 
She offers recommendations that address women’s relationship to media structures 
and argues for the need to develop policy frameworks that include gender equality 
requirements. Discussing media employment, Ross underscores the gender gaps in 
career advancement, remuneration and leadership positions in the industry, citing 
workplace cultures and practices as some of the contributing factors. She suggests 
that enlightened media employers understand both the ethical and the business case 
for gender diversity given the steps taken to implement policies and practices which 
nurture the talent of their whole workforce. Valdéz, Quintero, Farbman, Montiel and 
Chávez analyse the access and participation of women in community and indigenous 
media. 
 Section II covers the longstanding historical issues of both the misrepresentation 
and under-representation of women in media content, and the epidemic of violence 
against women (VAW) in and through media and ICTs that has entered into everyday 
public discourse in the recent past thanks to the #MeToo movement. Macharia 
contributes insights drawn from the longitudinal Global Media Monitoring Project 
(GMMP) study that has followed gender patterns in the world news media since 
1995, arguing that the power to change rests with governments, the media and 
ordinary audiences. Three papers discuss Violence Against Women in media and 
ICTs. Vega Montiel analyses the role media and ICTs have played in reinforcing the 
normalization of violence against women and girls in contents. Posetti and Storm 
call attention to the violence against women journalists online and offline. Ran 
offers a view on gender-based violence from a journalists’ trade union perspective 
and includes labour organizations’ recommendations on tackling violence in the 
workplace.
 A utilitarian perspective has reigned in most debates on gender and ICTs with 
emphasis on the role that the latter can play for women’s empowerment. Left out 
5of such discussions are concerns about Internet media monopolies, algorithms, 
surveillance, trolling and other questions that impact women disproportionately. 
In Section III, Gurumurthy, Vasudevan and Chami offer a feminist perspective on 
these and other digital sphere issues, underlining actions for global organisations, 
governments and civil society.
 In Section IV, the UNESCO University Network on Gender, Media and ICTs 
discusses education as a strategic domain to advance gender mainstreaming 
in communication and journalism curricula. The Network posits that gender 
mainstreaming is a necessary part of the process if the gender equality gaps in 
training institutions and the media industry are to be addressed.
 Three case studies are presented: On broadcast media regulators as gender 
equality drivers based on the Moroccan High Authority of Audiovisual Communication 
experience (Lemrini Elouahabi), on gender integration in African media (Faye) and on 
sustaining women-led community media in the Pacific (Rolls).
 The papers reflect the diversity of voices within the Global Alliance on Media 
and Gender (GAMAG), with many of the authors linked to organisations from 
both the global south and north that lead the debates on the international stage. 
This collection demonstrates GAMAG’s commitment to link with the international 
community to advance gender equality in and through the media and ICTs.
 This publication was supported with funding from the Kingdom of the 
Netherlands through UNESCO’s International Programme for the Development of 
Communication (IPDC-UNESCO) and from the International Association for Media 
and Communication Research (IAMCR).

1. The Challenge of Mainstreaming Gender 
Through Media and ICT Policy and Regulation
Claudia Padovani 7
INTRODUCTION
 Many initiatives and advocacy interventions have been implemented over the 
years to address gender inequalities in the media, but unless those efforts are 
properly embedded within policy frameworks and agreements, their effects are 
likely to be scattered and their impact is likely to be weakened. 
 Developing gender aware policies for the media has been indicated since the 
UN Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women (1995) as one of the steps to be 
taken to meet the goals of Section J of the Beijing Platform for Action those of 
promoting equal access to the media and decision-making (J1), and eliminating 
gender stereotypes in media content (J2). Section J clearly stated that governments 
and other actors are called upon to promote ‘an active policy of mainstreaming 
of a gender perspective in (media) policies and programs’ (par. 237) and should 
support research that reviews existing media policies (par. 239.b). The document

also encouraged ‘the participation of women in the development of professional 
guidelines and codes of conduct or other appropriate self-regulatory mechanisms 
to promote a balanced and non-stereotypical portrayals of women by the media’ 
(par. 241.d), while also calling for media organizations themselves to ‘elaborate and 
strengthen self-regulatory mechanisms and codes of conduct’ to comply with the 
objectives in Section J (par. 236 and 244.a/b). 
 During the 2003 Commission on the Status of Women, participants highlighted 
that the lack of, or insufficient attention to gender perspectives in media and 
communication policies needed to be addressed. The Commission indicated, as 
a very first recommendation for action, that of ensuring “women’s early and full 
participation in the development and implementation of national policies, legislation, …  
strategies and regulatory and technical instruments in the field of information and 
communication technologies (ICT) and media and communications”. It also urged 
stakeholders to create adequate “monitoring and accountability mechanisms to 
ensure implementation of gender-sensitive policies and regulations as well as to 
analyse the gender impact of such policies” (par. 4a). Furthermore, the Commission 
recommended the constitution of partnerships, to develop ‘self-regulatory gender 
sensitive guidelines for media coverage and representation, for public and community 
media to work in support of gender equality’ with a specific reference to the need to 
provide financial resources and other support measures to this end (per. 4e), including 
resources to support research to ‘review existing media and ICT policies’ (par. 4f). 
 More recently, the centrality of codes, policies and governing arrangements in 
combating persisting inequalities has been reaffirmed in international initiatives, 
including the Global Alliance for Media and Gender (GAMAG) and its Research and 
Policy Committee; the UN Women Global Compact ‘Step it up for gender equality in 
the media’; the UNITWIN University Network for Gender Media and ICT, as well as by a 
number of advocacy and scholarly contributions to the debate (UNESCO/IAMCR, 2014). 
 At the same time, attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals, in 
particular Goal 5 – Gender Equality – but more broadly the comprehensive set of 
10
SDGs, requires serious consideration of the necessary normative frameworks to 
be put in place, at all levels, from the local to the global in order to make gender 
mainstreaming a reality in the media and ICT sector.
Evidence shows that, as of today, these recommendations have not been prioritised 
in practice by governments, international and regional organizations, and media 
companies as well. Thereby, scrutiny of the interplay between gender, politics, 
and media policies remains crucial: (a) to develop necessary knowledge on the 
contradictions and structural problems that prevent gender equality from becoming 
a reality in the sector, and (b) to elaborate sound policy proposals that are needed 
to foster actions aimed at redressing persisting inequalities. 
 Therefore, the GAMAG calls for multi-stakeholder efforts to elaborate, adopt, 
foster and monitor gender-aware media and ICT policies and normative frameworks 
at organizational, national and international levels.
EVIDENCE
 Feminist researchers have engaged with supranational fora - such as UNESCO 
and the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), the Internet Governance 
Forum and others - denouncing the low level of attention for gender concerns in the 
formulation, implementation and evaluation of international normative frameworks 
for the media and ICT, as well as in policy venues where relevant debates took place 
(Gallagher, 2008, 2011; Jensen, 2008, 2010; Droussu and Jensen, 2005; McLaughlin 
and Pickard, 2005; Gurumurthy and Chami, 2014). 
 A number of policy-related studies of media gender inequalities with a regional 
focus – from North America (Beale, 2002; Shade, 2014) to Europe (Sarikakis and 
Nguyen, 2009; Padovani, 2016; Ostling and Nenadich, 2017) and Latin America 
(Chaher, 2014) – highlighted very limited commitments towards the Beijing 
Platform for Action policy recommendations. In the European Union, the European 
Commission, the Council and the European Parliament have often addressed these 
11
problems on the basis of contrasting priorities (Ross and Padovani, 2017); while 
‘soft policies’ – essentially non-binding, self-regulatory measures – e have mostly 
been adopted at the level of media organizations (Sarikakis and Nguyen, 2009; 
EIGE, 2013). In the Southern African Development Community (SADC), consistent 
regulatory mechanisms have been put in place, but this has only been possible 
thanks to sustained nongovernmental advocacy (GenderLinks, 2017). 
 Looking at the national level, what emerges from the preliminary findings of 
a UNESCO Global Survey on Gender and Media (2016) is that only 35% of world 
governments have mainstreamed gender issues by integrating them in national cultural 
policies; while in 37% of cases, gender equality strategies do not even mention the role 
and accountabilities of the media in fostering change. Some positive developments 
have characterised recent Latin American communication laws - particularly in 
Argentina (Chaher, 2014; Justo, 2017) and Mexico (Vega Montiel, 2014) - and yet 
sustainability of the adopted measures over time is recognized as a major issue.
 Shortcomings in gender mainstreaming have also been highlighted in relation 
to ICT policies: ‘digital agendas’ in Canada, India, the MENA region, Europe and 
Australia are all characterized by limited inclusion of gender concerns (Padovani 
and Shade, 2016); while Internet Governance as a space of policy discourse has 
been criticised for the limited degree of women’s participation, the marginality of 
substantive women’s issues addressed and the rhetorical nature of gender-relevant 
statements in formal provisions (Association for Progressive Communications, 
2012; Doria, 2015). 
 Two major international projects have included a systematic focus on media 
organizations’ internal policies and support mechanisms. The International Women’s 
Media Foundation (IWMF) Global Report on the Status of Women in the Media 
(IWMF, 2012) showed that slightly more than half of the (500) companies surveyed 
have an established company-wide policy on gender equity. These ranged from 16% 
in Eastern European to 69% in both Sub-Saharan Africa and Western Europe (IWMF, 
2012, p. 34). According to the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) Report 
12
on Advancing Gender Equality in Decision Making, only one quarter of the major (99) 
media organizations across 28 EU countries have a gender equality policy or code 
of conduct, and only one fifth have adopted an equality of opportunities or diversity 
policy (EIGE, 2013, p. 37; see also Ostling and Nenadich, 2017). Moreover, wide 
variations in the adoption of gender-related policies can be found both between 
and within the different regions. 
 Overall, the low level of adoption of media and communication policies and 
regulatory frameworks is highly problematic, especially if we consider the diverse 
functions these measures play. They are, in fact, crucial to expose and address 
inequalities in as much as they define principles and goals, and provide benchmarks 
to assess progress and change (Gallagher, 2011; 2017). At the same time, they 
contribute to the profound cultural transformation that is needed to achieve a 
redistribution of symbolic and material resources necessary overcome gendered 
inequalities (Chaher, 2014). Such measures can also contribute to guarantee 
sustainability over time of positive changes towards gender equality (Gallagher, 
2011; 2017) when it is clear that progress is not a given and step-backs are always a 
possibility (WACC, 2015; Ross and Padovani, 2017). 
 Examples of good practice in the adoption of gender equality policies and 
support mechanisms, particularly by public service television, can be found in 
countries like Sweden, the UK, Spain, Austria and South Africa; and measures 
to enforce gender-equality in the audio-visual media have been adopted by 
independent regulatory authorities in countries like France and Morocco. However, 
even when media internal policies and national regulatory frameworks are in 
place, this is not a sufficient condition to produce better gender-responsive media 
outputs in terms of content, access and participation. Issues of implementation and 
sustained commitment, also through adequate funding and support mechanisms, 
remain challenges to make media and ICT gender equality a reality. 
 In this context, scrutiny of the interplay between gender, media and ICTs 
policies remains crucial to develop necessary knowledge on the contradictions 
13
that prevent gender equality from becoming a reality in this sector. Structural and 
cultural barriers to equality need to be fully appreciated in their interaction with 
communication and ICT policy developments. Hence, more research that is focused, 
intersectional, transnational, and comparative is needed to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of how governing arrangements relate to gender equality in practice, 
and in different geo-cultural and socio-economic contexts.
RECOMMENDATIONS
 Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goal states that “providing women and 
girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in 
political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies 
and benefit societies and humanity at large”. What needs highlight is the centrality 
of gender-aware and gender-responsive media and ICT policies to the attainment 
of such goal; also in view of its crucial interplay with all other SDGs. In fact, the 
intersection of various dimensions of gender inequality have implications for the 
promotion of better educational, health and living conditions for women and men 
across societies; and this calls for the development of consistent norms, institutions, 
and governing arrangements that contribute to reducing gender inequalities, as well 
as ending other forms of exclusion and discrimination in contemporary knowledge 
societies. 
Building on the above, the authors' Recommendations  are :
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:
• Ensure the full realization of gender mainstreaming in national communication 
governance. This implies a commitment to mainstream gender equality in national 
media policies and digital strategies, and also an explicit acknowledgement of the 
role and relevance of media and ICTs within gender equality strategies. 
• Include in national media and ICT policy initiatives reference to fundamental 
principles, as well as indicate concrete and sustained measures to foster media 
14
gender equality, through the involvement of gender expertise, organizing 
transformative gender training activities and developing monitoring and 
assessment mechanisms. Adequate resources should be made available for the 
implementation of such strategies.
• Promote a better understanding of the difficulties, challenges and opportunities of 
including gender equality principles and support measures in the media and ICT 
sector and its governance at the national level. This should be done through the 
conduct of comprehensive studies and analyses. 
• Avail adequate resources for the conduct of research activities – at the national 
level and cross-national – to produce methodologically sound reviews of existing 
policy measures, and to elaborate evidence-based proposals for future policy 
interventions.
UN AGENCIES SHOULD:
•  Make media and ICT gender equality a priority in the context of the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development, also through networking and strengthening existing 
international normative frameworks - from CEDAW to the Beijing Platform for 
Action to the final documents adopted at the 62nd session of the Commission on 
the Status of Women. 
• In view of elaborating sound and sustainable programs to foster media gender 
equality at national and regional level, commit towards a global research plan, 
focused on media and ICT governing structures and arrangements across the 
world’s regions. This would aim at better understanding to what extent and under 
what conditions public policy and regulatory interventions may produce/facilitate/
support the necessary change towards making the media and ICTs more gender 
equal. This research activity may be conducted in close collaboration with the 
GAMAG’s Policy and Research Committee. 
15
• In particular, UN Women and UNESCO should promote interdisciplinary and 
inter-sectorial policy-focused, multi-stakeholder encounters, aimed at exchanging 
information, knowledge and good practice. These should be organized on a regular 
basis and be institutionally supported, to create the conditions for an on-going 
dialogue between gender and media scholars, professionals and actors involved 
in the governance of communications, so as to develop the capacity to address 
the challenges deriving from future digital communication developments through 
adequate policy interventions, with a forward-looking gender mainstreaming 
perspective.
MEDIA INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS AND PROFESSIONALS SHOULD:
• Take steps to address the lack of formal adoption of gender equality policies, 
gender-related normative frameworks and support mechanisms. 
• Integrate equality strategies (such as equality or diversity policies, parental leave 
policies, policies for return to job after maternal leave), including within self-
regulatory measures (such as codes of conducts and guidelines).
• Accompany these measures with support mechanisms for monitoring 
(observatories and ad hoc units), evaluation (regular gender-assessment plans) 
and implementation. These measures are important for an equality ethos to be 
firmly embedded in each organization’s operations, to favour gender-sensitive 
transformation in the organizational culture, and to give a clear signal that 
equality issues are taken seriously, thus fostering sustainability of gender-equal 
transformations over time.
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD:
• Continue promoting awareness and disseminating knowledge – transnationally 
and through collaborative initiatives – about the challenges and opportunity of 
gender equal media and ICTs, with a specific goal to foster the adoption of relevant 
16
policies and mechanisms to address structural and cultural unequal power 
relations in the sector.
• Provide expert and diverse knowledge towards the formulation, adoption 
and implementation of policy measures – at the organizational, national and 
international levels – that will inform gender-aware media and future technological 
developments. 
RESEARCHERS SHOULD:
• Further map out, critically investigate and analyse media and ICT policy measures 
and governing arrangements from a gender equality perspective. They have a 
crucial role to play in better understanding policy challenges in national contexts. 
Furthermore, they can harness the potential of existing international networks – 
like the GAMAG’s Policy and Research Committee, the UNITWIN Network on Gender 
Media and ICT or the International Association for Media and Communication – to 
participate in transnational comparative projects. 
• Should adequate resources be made available by governments and international 
agencies – as per the above recommendations – elaborate coordinated research 
plans for policy oriented investigation on media gender equality, including analytical 
frameworks, adequate multi-method approaches, and multi-level perspectives. 
These investigations may focus on the various aspects of policy-making processes, 
including: policy process and involvement of different stakeholders, discursive 
approaches to gender equality framing in media policy arrangements, the use 
and implication of digital technologies in policy development, and analyses of the 
implementation of gender equality policies.
RESOURCES AND GOOD PRACTICE
 A collection of good practice related to media policies and normative frameworks 
for gender equality in the media is being created as part of an EU funded project: 
17
Advancing Gender Equality in Media Industries (AGEMI). 
 The project is supported by the ‘Rights, Equality and Citizenship/Justice’ 
programme of the European Union and coordinated by Karen Ross (University of 
Newcastle, UK) and Claudia Padovani (University of Padova, Italy). The Resources 
Bank will feature good practice derived from a global survey and informed collection. 
It will be online by late 2018.

2. Gender Equality, Policy and Media Structures
Carolyn M. Byerly, Ph.D. 8
INTRODUCTION
 The convergence of traditional print, broadcast and cable with digital (computer) 
formats requires that we understand ‘ICTs’ (information and communications 
technology) to include the wide array of media used for personal, interpersonal, and 
mass communication in today’s world. Women must have full access to these media, 
at ownership, employment and personal levels. This paper responds specifically to 
Goal Number 5 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2015-2030. 
That goal is to Achieve Gender Equality and Empower all Women and Girls, and 
proposed target ‘5.b’ specifically concerns the use of ICTs to promote women’s 
empowerment.
 However, having a greater ability to own and control media companies will also 
affect women’s ability to benefit from other SDGs as well. Greater communication 
will enable them to: articulate their aspirations for greater peace and justice (SDG-
16); to participate more actively in the expansion of industry and infrastructures 
(SDG-9), especially related to the communications sector in their respective nations; 
advocate more actively for clean water and sanitation (SDG-6), affordable and clean 
energy (SDG-7), ways to end hunger (SDG-2) and poverty (SDG-1); and to more 
actively purvey information about all of the many other issues related to sustainable 
development in which women’s interests are firmly embedded.

 If the monitoring of media content over the last 40 years has shown anything, 
it is that women’s right to be seen and heard has not progressed at the same rate 
as their real-life roles or their needs to fully participate in society. Since the 1970s, 
women have benefited from women’s liberation movements and taken ever greater 
leads in business, education, politics, and public life. Yet, they are still unable to 
speak in their own self-interest in the news media of most countries – either as 
expert sources, or to articulate pro-feminist opinions (World Association of Christian 
Communication, 2015). Women are similarly under-represented in Hollywood 
films, which are viewed all over the world (Hunt, Tran, Sargent and Díaz, 2017). 
Regional studies show that women’s voices and images are similarly marginalised in 
traditional, as well as new digital, media formats of both developed and developing 
nations (Byerly, forthcoming).
 Much of the focus in both research and human rights groups has been on 
women’s access  to ICTs, with a particular concern with the digital divide between 
men and women. A moderate share of the concern has also been with gaps in 
infrastructure  (i.e., availability) and with user issues, such as the dominance of 
English in web-based information (Annan, 2005). Therefore, this paper seeks to 
broaden attention on women’s relationship to the structures  of the industries that 
still thwart them from exercising their right to communicate. Structural relations 
are present and perpetuated in the macro-level of the media landscape and include 
finance, policy, and governance.
EVIDENCE  
 The right to expression was recognized as a human right by Article 19 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Adopted by the United Nations’ 
General Assembly, Article 19 states: 
 ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes 
freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart 
information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers’ (Article 19). 
24
 Yet current research shows women’s difficulty in exercising that right to 
communicate within the industries. In media professions, they remain prevented 
from entering decision-making roles both within news and entertainment sectors 
(Byerly, 2011; Hunt et al., 2017, Lauzen, 2017; Ross and Padovani, 2017; Vega 
Montiel, 2012). As the Table 1 below illustrates, few women are allowed to accede to 
the prestigious role of policy-making exercised by boards of directors in large digital 
media conglomerates (Byerly, forthcoming). These companies provide both the 
infrastructure and content of the vast majority of all communication, the world over. 
They also control an enormous amount of wealth, wealth that their mostly male 
governors use to help elect pro-corporate legislators and to shape media policy in 
their favour.

 Media conglomeration characterises the great majority of the world’s 
communication systems today where women are marginalized at decision-
making levels, as has been shown. We may thus conclude that women are 
presently peripheral to both the control of, and related benefits from, the world’s 
communication technology companies and what they provide. The salient question 
to pose with this realization is how will women become full participants in their 
societies if they cannot affect the telling of their own stories, if society does not 
see the wide array of images and roles they occupy, and people cannot obtain the 
information they need for societies advancement by addressing gender inequality?

 Women have paid less attention to the national, regional and international policy 
governing communication systems than they have to more practical realities, such as 
information available (or not, within those systems) and access to jobs. There is little 
research to date on whether, and to what extent, gender equality figures in national 
level communication policies. Male scholars have avoided the subject for the most 
part, and both feminist scholars and activists have given it only minor attention 
(Gallagher, 2014). Yet, as Gallagher (2011) insists, any discussion of freedom of 
expression must ask, ‘whose freedom, defined by whom?’ (p. 457). It should not 
be defined, as it typically has, as men’s right to utilize the profits of communication 
companies to secure their own economic and political power, or continue to omit 
and stereotype women in the content of their news and programming.
 Despite the passage of international documents like the Beijing Platform for 
Action in 1995, with its Section J calling for gender equality in the media, or the 
Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), there 
has been little success in securing a place for gender and media concerns on the 
international agenda (Gallagher, 2011, p. 459; Ross and Padovani, 2013; Media 
Compact, 2015). The next frontier for media research and activism, therefore, is at 
national and international policy levels, something that gatherings of women, such 
as the annual U.N. Commission on the Status of Women meetings in New York City 
affords the opportunity to develop.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 In order to respond to the points of GAMAG’s position on women’s relationship 
to media structures, it is essential to develop policy frameworks that incorporate 
requirements for gender equality, for mechanisms that enable those policies 
to function as intended, and for monitoring activities that assess progress and 
efficacy of those policies. The development of such policy frameworks will require 
the involvement and support of international governmental agencies and non-
governmental organizations concerned with communication rights. Toward these 
ends, GAMAG supports the following recommendations: 
30
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:
• Adopt public policies that enable greater numbers of women to own media 
companies that serve both local and national populations.
• Fund academic and NGO projects to monitor media companies as regards gender 
equality in national level media policy and industry compliance. 
• Require appropriate national-level agencies to monitor women’s status in all levels 
of employment within both traditional and new digital media companies. 
UN AGENCIES SHOULD: 
• Assist in moving gender equality in media ownership onto both national and 
international agendas of the forums where communication rights and relevant 
issues such as SDGs are addressed. 
• Adopt requirements and methods that allow full participation by women in the 
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process. 
• Convene panels of experts on media policy, ICTs and women’s communication to 
update gender sensitive indicators and guidelines for national level and corporate 
level media policies. 
• Underwrite research projects aimed at identifying policies already in place that can 
serve as models, as well as identify efforts where media activism is advocating for 
gender equality in communication policy. 
MEDIA INDUSTRY ORGANIZATIONS AND PROFESSIONALS SHOULD:  
• Adopt, implement and monitor workplace policies that assure gender equality in 
hiring, training, promotion, and placement of media professionals.
31
• Develop employee performance standards that are free of gender bias. 
• Develop guidelines for programming and news production that assure gender 
balance and sensitivity in content.
• Monitor, evaluate and correct (as needed) policies and practices aimed at assuring 
gender sensitivity in companies and their programming and news.
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD:
• Identify problems in access to new media (ICTs) for women, and develop strategies 
for policy changes at national and company levels. 
• Advocate for gender equality in training and employment within media companies.
• Advocate for national level policy aimed at increasing women’s media ownership 
and service on boards of directors. 
• Form coalitions with communication trade unions, women’s organizations, and 
activist scholars/researchers to develop multi-stakeholder advocacy for gender 
equality in and throughout the media industries. 
• Move gender equality in media ownership onto both national and international 
agendas of the forums where communication rights and other issues are 
addressed.
RESEARCHERS SHOULD:
• Generate empirical data that reveal the level of gender equality in communication 
policies at national levels and within industries of individual nations, with respect 
to media ownership, technology access, and employment in media. 
32
•  Conduct empirical studies that evaluate men’s and women’s experiences in media 
industries with respect to training on ICTs. 
• Establish longitudinal studies that track gender equality in media employment, 
ownership, and governance (boards).
• Promote theory-building to explain conditions within media industries that both 
hinder and enable gender equality to exist within companies.

3. A Hard Ladder to Climb: 
Women and Power in Media Industries
Karen Ross 9
9 Professor of Gender and Media, Director of Research at the School of Arts and Cultures, 
Newcastle University, U.K.INTRODUCTION 
 When women media professionals attain very senior editorial positions, their 
achievement continues to make front page news, as it is such a rare occurrence. 
When Jill Abramson became the first woman editor at the New York Times in 2011, 
she broke a run of 160 years of male editors. When Katharine Viner did the same 
thing at the Guardian in 2015, she ended an even longer reign of exclusively male 
editing history. One of the world’s most respected media institutions, the BBC, 
has never appointed a woman Director General since it began life under John 
Reith in 1922. Further, its publication of top earner salaries in the summer of 2017 
revealed startling differences, in some cases as much as 300% between women 
and men doing the same job. These three examples demonstrate that even media 
organizations which enjoy a significant reputation for their content seem to ignore 
issues of gender equality in relation to who produces and edits such content. Media 
and journalism courses are dominated by women – students – trend which has been 
rising over the past two decades – who graduate and enter the industry in higher 
numbers than men (Reid, 2015). It seems odd, then, if we assume that women and 
men are equally competent when entering the industry, to find men advancing more 
quickly than women, earning a higher salary for work of equal value and routinely 
achieving very senior positions, leaving their female colleagues languishing in the 
less prestigious media jobs and rarely getting beyond junior management posts. 
35
How can we account for this phenomenon and the problem of gender inequality 
which, we argue, lies at its heart? 
EVIDENCE 
 While we have had decades of research looking at the broader gender and media 
agenda, especially looking at issues of representation and consumption, there has 
been rather less research on working practices, careers and promotion within media 
industries themselves. One of the first efforts to document and analyse the specific 
issue of women and decision-making was commissioned by UNESCO and reported on 
as Women and Media Decision-making: The Invisible Barriers  (1987). In her introduction 
to the book, Gallagher (1987, p.14) commented that ‘men’s attitudes, beliefs and even 
organizational procedures [showed a] surprising degree of consistency across the 
studies.’ Successive studies over the following decades showed, more or less, the 
same kind of patterns (Gallagher, 1995; Robinson, 2005; Smith, 2015; North, 2016a; 
Jenkins & Finneman, 2018; de Vuyst & Raeymaeckers, 2019), finding that despite the 
numbers entering the industry, women advanced unevenly into decision-making 
roles compared to men, often doing better in larger organizations. 
 In 2011, the International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF) published findings 
from its study of women’s employment in news companies (conducted and managed 
by Carolyn Byerly) covering 59 nations and 522 organizations, finding that men held 
75% of both top management and board positions: women’s presence was strongest 
in routine news gathering roles and weakest in technical roles (e.g. camera work, 
creative direction, etc.). In 2013, the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) 
published the findings from a study of all the (then) EU Member States plus Croatia (28 
countries) into gender and decision-making in 99 large-scale European media houses. 
That study, conducted and managed by Karen Ross and Claudia Padovani, found that, 
of 3376 senior posts they coded, 30% were held by women. When we looked a little 
closer, we found that 16% of CEOs were women, as were 21% of Chief Operating 
Officers, demonstrating that although a proportion of women are in positions of 
authority, they are much less likely to be in positions of power.
36
 These studies are important, not only because of their findings, but because 
of their comparative scope and geographical reach. National studies are often 
dismissed because of the specificity of the socio-cultural context, but where cross-
cultural studies show similar trends and patterns, they command more credibility 
for the suggestion that ‘something’ is happening which is structural, rather than 
situational, and requires explaining. 
 We suggest that there are any number of factors in play at any one time in any 
one media organization, but the point is that these factors are found universally, 
exerting more or less influence in different ways at different times. Factors such as 
routine gender-based discrimination, workplace harassment, non-existent or poorly 
implemented gender equality policies and informal promotion processes, serve 
to produce a working environment that does not support women or their career 
aspirations. While some studies have provided slightly more optimistic findings, the 
general trend shows little significant progress over time and even in studies where 
improvements have been noted, they have tended to occur in individual countries 
or individual media organizations (Djerf-Pierre, 2007), or specific media forms such 
as digital media (De-Miguel et. al., 2017). The most recent scholarship shows that 
progress for women into decision-making positions remains painfully slow, for all 
the reasons we have sketched out (Löfgren Nilsson and Örnebring, 2016; North, 
2016b; Melki and Mallat, 2017).
 So far, we have looked at academic studies, but other stakeholders have also 
been involved in exploring the issues which women face in developing their media 
careers, most notably professional associations such as the International Federation of 
Journalists (IFJ), the European Women’s Lobby (EWL) and various working groups of the 
European Commission and Council of Europe (see, for example, European Commission, 
2010; EWL, 2010). These studies produce the same conclusions as the rest.
 Importantly, the structural and cultural barriers which prevent women’s 
advancement into managerial and editorial positions also operate to prevent 
women’ occupation of boardroom seats. In the EIGE (2013) study mentioned above, 
37
the percentage of board members who were women was 27%, but women occupied 
few (22%) deputy positions. In October 2012, European Commissioner Viviane 
Reding formally proposed that the European Parliament should enact legislation 
to accelerate the number of women in the boardrooms of public companies. The 
proposal aimed to achieve a 40% presence of the ‘under-represented’ sex (for which 
we should read ‘women’) among non-executive directors of the top 5000 publicly-
listed companies by 2020, and by 2018 for publicly-funded organizations. Her 
proposal was, more or less, immediately rejected by her fellow Commissioners on 
the grounds that it contravened the Commission’s own regulations. The proposed 
legislation was subsequently reframed as an ‘objective’ and thus has no prospect of 
achieving the change required.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 A number of studies discussed above have made recommendations and 
suggested actions which could be taken to address the long-standing problems, 
both structural and cultural, which impede women’s efforts to pursue their career 
aspirations and fulfil their potential. It really does not make sense at any level, ethical 
or business-wise, to deliberately or unconsciously under-utilize the talents of 50% 
of the media workforce. One significant problem in working for change has been 
a lack of knowledge by media managers about the scale of the issue and potential 
solutions.
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:
• Require all organizations with 500+ employees to produce Gender Equality Plans 
on an annual basis with sanctions on organizations which: (a) do not comply and/
or (b) which fail to meet their own targets for improving the gender balance of 
their workforce at all levels of the organization.
38
UN AGENCIES SHOULD:
• Support the development of prizes for excellent practice in gender equality for 
different media categories, similar to the Prix Iris or Pulitzer. 
 MEDIA ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD:
• Undertake a Gender Audit of the workforce to identify women and men’s presence 
at all levels of an organization.
• Where there is an under-representation of women or men at a particular level, 
review recruitment and promotion policies to ensure they are fair and transparent. 
The audit should be undertaken on a regular basis to identify patterns and trends 
and to enable progress to be measured year-on-year. 
• The findings from such an audit should be analysed and interpreted and a plan 
of action developed to monitor and act upon persistent gender imbalances. 
Such audits could be required as part of continuing funding arrangements for 
organizations which are wholly or partly publicly or government funded.
• Organize a staff survey on equality and diversity to better understand workplace 
culture and to act on the findings if they suggest that staff believe that gender-
based, or any other forms of discrimination, are taking place.
• Ensure that there are policies in place for reporting discrimination, and enforce 
clear sanctions where behaviour of staff is found to be in breach of such policies.
•  Take positive action to redress gender imbalances at senior levels by appointing 
the woman when deciding between a female and male candidate of equal merit. 
Members of shortlisting, recruitment and promotion panels should participate in 
equality awareness training to ensure that they are not introducing unconscious 
bias into their decision-making processes. 
39
• Where algorithms are used in recruitment processes, these should be investigated 
for gender bias and revised (or even abandoned) if such biases are seen to be 
operating. 
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS 
(MEDIA UNIONS AND WOMEN FOCUSED NGOS) SHOULD:
• Develop partnerships at global, regional and national level, to recommend and 
assess the implementation of women-friendly working practices developed by 
media organizations.
• Share best practice between each other and liaise with the academic research 
community to disseminate good practice.
ACADEMIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY SHOULD:
• Promote further and larger-scale research projects to measure women’s 
inclusion in decision-making positions in both large and small organizations, 
including the digital media sector, to identify patterns, as well as good practices, 
where they exist. 
• Devise action and dissemination projects, including online repositories, which 
share research findings and good practices amongst the wider practitioner and 
stakeholder community.

INTRODUCTION 
 Female members of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters 
(AMARC) are taking advantage of the organizing presence of community and 
indigenous media outlets that are active in GAMAG globally. This is in order to address 
the lack of clear and specific rules recognizing women’s rights to communication and 
the transformation of gender stereotypes into laws and public policy. It is also so 
that these outlets develop their own instruments to support women’s participation 
and negotiation within their own collectives, networks, movements and national 
and local decision-making bodies.
 Although there are different expressions and disparities between countries and 
contexts, generally speaking, women have found community radio to be an ideal 
medium for participation. These spaces for participation have been occupied by 
women, regardless of legal or political restrictions that might exist in community 
media within each country, or the presence or absence of a gender perspective 
in these media. Furthermore, there is undeniable evidence that where there are 
explicit legal or political conditions in place to promote women’s participation on 
an equal footing with male colleagues in the media, the process of integration and 
strengthening can take place more quickly, and indicators can be found to measure 
the progress of these efforts.

23 For this chapter the author consulted: Mónica Valdés, Colombia, Regional Vice President 
of AMARC ALC; Wi Wendy Quintero, Nicaragua, Vice President of the AMARC ALC Women’s 
Network; Celeste Farbman, AMARC programme ‘Nos Quemaron Por Brujas’, Argentina, and; 
Norma Montiel, Representative of the Women’s Network of AMARC Mexico.
45
 This chapter seeks to offer some answers to the question of what progress has 
been achieved by women participating in community radio projects between 2013 
and 2018, based on experiences in Colombia, Nicaragua, Mexico and Argentina. The 
answers show that conditions differ country to country, and that women’s position 
in community media is also fairly disparate.
EVIDENCE 
NICARAGUA 
 There are no specific laws concerning community media in the country. 
Community radio programs that do exist were formed out of grass-roots adherence 
to the concepts of community radio broadcasting. These radio stations depend 
on advertising and funding raised from other types of projects. The women who 
participate in these programs depend on whatever revenues are at hand, and the 
work of network organizing depends on the availability and time each woman has 
to devote to it. So, in general, conditions are unfavorable for this form of media. 
For example, the women’s network of AMARC Nicaragua has made an effort to 
draft gender policies that encourage women’s presence in community radio, but 
their organizational processes have not been enough for them to complete the 
process. 
COLOMBIA 
 In Colombia there is a law on the books regarding community media, but it does 
not incorporate a gender perspective. Community media have played a crucial role 
in the peacebuilding process in that country, and in this, women’s involvement has 
been fundamental. However, there have been no specific efforts to strengthen and 
support women in their work with this type of media. Within the Colombian political 
context, the priority is placed on efforts to build peace, but this has not yet included 
specific measures for women to organize or establish minimum criteria for gaining 
a stronger foothold in such media. In Colombia, therefore, there is no organization 
46
of women, nor the express manifestation of the need to address this sector in 
particular.
ARGENTINA 
 The Audiovisual Media Law of Argentina was, at the time of its promulgation, 
Latin America’s most progressive law on freedom of expression, but this distinction 
did not necessarily guarantee a gender perspective in the media, including in 
community media. 
 According to Emi Farías of Red Nosotras en el Mundo; a gender perspective is not 
present in the law, even less after recent decrees that repealed various articles of the 
law. However, the ‘Defensoría del Público’ (Office of the Public Defender) still exists, 
one of the remaining vestiges of the Law’s original intent. This Office is, in practice, 
the entity that protects the rights of audiences, community media and women. 
Speaking more specifically of women’s participation in the media, Argentine women 
have created huge mobilizations in favor of women’s rights. In the past two years, they 
have organized large-scale movements claiming justice in femicide cases, protesting 
violence against women and demanding decriminalization of abortion. The Argentine 
women involved in community media have organized themselves around the feminist 
moment, so they have not generated long-term organizational structures, but their 
organization around specific issues has built lasting ties of solidarity.
MEXICO 
 Mexico’s situation is that most community radio concessions are members 
of the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters, and it is within this 
Association that the necessary conditions have been created for women to organize 
to defend freedom of expression and their right to information. AMARC has 
incorporated Gender Policy into its internal organizational policies, and it is through 
these that compliance indicators can be established in keeping with the respective 
context. 
47
 The network is growing every day. Some of the indicators used to consider a 
radio station’s membership application are: the number of women participating, 
mechanisms for increasing women’s participation, the mainstreaming of a gendered 
perspective across the full range of programming, the use of inclusive language, etc. 
While these indicators may be somewhat subjective and contextual, the challenge is 
to establish these indicators on a methodological and institutional level.
CONCLUSIONS 
 •  The articulation of women’s participation in community radio broadcasting 
may lack mechanisms of organization. However, this does not prevent gender 
equality from playing an important role in the organization and mobilization of 
organizations and women around situations in which rights are violated.
• Women in community communications are fundamental in social peace efforts, 
such as in Colombia’s peacebuilding process.
• Organizing outside of an organization, or non-institutional organization, is valuable 
and important, but the creation of legal or regulatory frameworks can be useful 
tools for advancing toward substantive equality.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 More needs to be done to ensure that women are appropriately introduced 
and represented in this sector, according to Miglioretto and Randhawa (2017). 
They propose strategies to improve women’s position in community radio and to 
promote good regulatory practices. The set of recommendations presented below 
are aimed mainly at regulatory bodies:
48
ENCOURAGE DIVERSITY OF REPRESENTATION 
IN APPLICATIONS FOR RADIO LICENSES
• The decision to grant a license to an applicant should take into account the diversity 
that exists within the committee or representatives applying for a licence. This 
is not limited to the issue of gender, although this is undoubtedly an important 
component. The applicants should also demonstrate that a serious effort has 
been made to include a diversity of voices from other marginalized segments of 
the community including, for example, indigenous women, Dalit women (one of 
the lower castes in India), migrant women, disabled or differently abled women 
and/or LGBTQI people.
• In cases where a licence applicants are found to be insufficiently diverse, regulators 
may ask them to present a plan to improve diversity and ensure the inclusion of 
diverse voices, both on the air and in station management.
INDICATE A COMMITMENT TO INVOLVE 
DIVERSE PERSONS IN THE STATION  
• Licence holders should state on their application how they ensure the full and 
equal participation of women in the station, from voices on the air to station 
management, working with technical equipment and volunteers. This should 
include how prospective women volunteers and the radio team will be included, as 
well as measures taken to ensure that marginalized communities are represented, 
and how training programs will be created and implemented.
APPLICATIONS FOR STATIONS MANAGED 
AND MADE UP EXCLUSIVELY OF WOMEN 
• While the radio frequency spectrum operates equally for all genders, community 
radio licenses should be granted to committees made up exclusively of women. 
It is expected that the applicants in these cases comply with the diversity criteria 
49
indicated above. Here, diversity would mean a fuller range of experience among 
participating women, with an emphasis on the involvement of women from 
marginalized groups and prioritization of these voices.
COMMITMENT TO FUND 
AND TRAIN WOMEN IN RADIO BROADCASTING
• Licence applications should include a summary of how women’s radio broadcasting 
and the training of women in technical positions, on the air and in station 
management will be carried out; with special emphasis on how these aspects of 
the station will be financed on an ongoing basis. 
• The station must commit to introducing gender policies or, when the station has 
no gender policy, it should provide a timeline for when these will be drafted and 
implemented.

Media Content and 
Violence Against Women
5. Addressing Gender Issues in Media Content
Sarah Macharia 24
INTRODUCTION  
 In 1995, governments participating in the Fourth World Conference on Women 
in Beijing reached consensus on specific strategic objectives and related actions 
to advance equality, development and peace for all women. One objective – to 
“promote a balanced and non-stereotyped portrayal of women in the media” 
(Section J on “women and the media”, Beijing Platform for Action, 2015) – listed 
several actions, inter alia, promoting research and implementing an information, 
education and communication strategy, encouraging the media to refrain from 
exploitation, sexualisation and commodification of women, and promoting the idea 
that sexist stereotypes in media are gender discriminatory, degrading and offensive.
 Eight years later in 2003, the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) 
recognized “the potential of the media and of information and communication 
technologies to contribute to the advancement and empowerment of women” 
(Agreed conclusions , CSW47, 2003). The CSW proposed 24 actions for governments, 
the UN system, international financial institutions, civil society, the private sector 
24 Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), Gender & Communication Manager at the 
World Association for Christian Communication (WACC), Toronto
53
and other stakeholders. The Commission underlined the need to prioritise 
gender perspectives in ICT and media policy and regulations, to support research, 
education and training, to strengthen inter-stakeholder partnerships, to tackle 
media-based violence against women and to allocate adequate resources. These 
recommendations and commitments reappear in various global, regional and 
national gender equality and women’s rights frameworks adopted over time (see 
Table 1).
 The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ‘seek to realize the human rights 
of all and achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls 
(Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development , UN General 
Assembly, 2015). The role of media in advancing gender equality is mentioned 
specifically in the Post-2015 development blueprint under Goal 5 on enhancing the 
use of ‘information and communications technology to promote the empowerment 
of women’. 
 At the same time, it is clear that media are implicated in the achievement of 
gender equality aspirations in all 17 SDGs, in as far as their role in maintaining social 
and cultural norms underpinning discrimination and inequality across all thematic 
areas is concerned. For instance, if media content that channels negative gender 
stereotypes, belittles, degrades and sexualises women, and normalises gender 
violence, how could removal of social barriers to the empowerment of girls and 
women (Agenda 2030 Declaration, para 8), or eliminating gender violence (para 20) 
be addressed? Media output that clearly challenges gender stereotypes provides 
the exposure needed to eliminate the prejudices, attitudes, norms and practices 
that sustain gender-based discrimination, marginalisation and inequality.
 The Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women 
(CEDAW) recognizes the role of stereotypes in ‘giving rise to the multitude of legal, 
political and economic constraints on the advancement of women (Introduction, 
CEDAW, UN General Assembly, 1979). Article 5 of the Convention obliges States 
parties to take measures to ‘modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct 
54
of men and women with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and 
customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or 
the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for women and men’. 
Combatting sexist stereotypes in the media is a necessary part of this process.

EVIDENCE 
 While state media regulators, media industry bodies and media organizations 
have, to varying extents, made efforts to translate the global, regional and national 
commitments into implementable policies, codes and guidelines for the media, the 
results remain uninspiring. The evidence below is confined to the news media due 
to the availability of a volume of data gathered over time and across multiple nation 
states. 
 Results from Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) 20-year research on 
gender in news media content reveal that the rate of progress towards media 
gender parity has been very slow (Macharia, 2015): 
• Globally, women make up only 24% of the persons heard, read about or seen in 
newspaper, television and radio news. In 20 years, the needle towards parity has 
moved by only seven points. The gender gap is narrowest in stories on science and 
health and widest in news about politics and government, in which women are 
only 16% of the people in the stories. Secretariat of the

• As news sources, women appear most as persons providing testimony based on 
personal experience (38%) and least as experts (19%). Across 10 years, women’s 
voice as experts has increased by only two points.
• Progress towards news representation that acknowledges women’s participation 
in productive life remains elusive. Globally women hold approximately 40% of paid 
employment, while a large proportion work in the informal sector, particularly in 
Global South contexts. In the world depicted in the news, only 20% of the total 
workers in the formal labour force are women, while 67% of the unemployed and 
stay-at-home parents are women.
• Only one out of ten stories since 2000 has focussed centrally on women. That 
this proportion has remained constant across almost two decades suggests 
that women’s value as newsworthy has not changed, and perhaps a continued 
disinterest of reporters, producers and editors in women’s lives, stories and 
experiences. Economic news, followed by political news, are least likely to focus on 
women, at 5% and 7% of stories in these topics respectively.
• Many stories present opportunities to highlight gender equality or inequality 
issues, yet, only 9% do so globally. While this number signals a steady rise since 
2005, it remains under the 10% - or one in ten – mark. The largest strides in 
integrating a gender equality perspective have been in science and health news, 
followed by economic, and crime/violence stories.
• Similarly, many stories present opportunities to challenge gender stereotypes, 
but only 4% do so, a negligible one percentage point change since 2005. Gender 
stereotypes have remained firmly embedded in news media output over the past 
decade. In 10 years there has been no progress in the proportion of political news 
stories that clearly challenge gender stereotypes, while stereotypes appear to 
have increased in social and legal news.
59
• Women’s relative invisibility in traditional news media has crossed over into 
digital news delivery platforms. The roles in which they appear mirror the results 
from traditional print and broadcast news. Only 4% of news media tweets 
clearly challenge gender stereotypes, exactly similar to the overall percentage of 
television, radio and print news stories.
 The next GMMP research is scheduled for 2020, at which time the statistics 
will be updated. The 2020 monitoring will generate new evidence on changes in 
progress towards closing the gender gap in sources, experts and other indicators of 
gender equality in news media content. 
 News is a genre governed by professional codes and can be held to a different 
standard compared to fictional media. The critique, however, cuts across all 
media forms that are just as, and oftentimes more, complicit in the sexualisation, 
trivialisation and objectification of women, as well as the normalisation of violence 
against girls and women.
 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
 The research evidence suggests that more than two decades since Beijing, 
gender issues in media content remain pertinent. The power to change lies with 
governments, the media and ordinary audiences.
 Governments need to acknowledge the important place of media and 
communication within the broader objective of promoting gender equality and 
women’s empowerment. Professional media, in particular, have a fundamental 
obligation, following industry ethics, to present balanced, fair and accurate content. 
Media organizations need to be accountable to the societies in which they operate 
and the audiences they serve. Gender equality is embraced as a global goal and 
media have a significant role in promoting or in sabotaging its achievement. 
Weak and inconsistent implementation of gender policies needs to be addressed. 
Institutionalisation of a gender-sensitive journalistic culture remains paramount. 
60
 Specific Recommendations  offered by the GMMP Network25 include the 
following: 
STATE MEDIA REGULATORY AGENCIES SHOULD: 
• Require media houses to adopt and enforce an agreed gender policy and guidelines 
for gender-sensitive reporting.
• Include, in media evaluation criteria, issues of gender balance and demonstrated 
adherence to the gender policy.
• Impose meaningful fines on media houses found liable of sex discrimination or 
other actions of non-compliance of their agreed gender policy. 
• Build capacity of staff responsible for hearing cases on media non-compliance of 
the gender policy.
MEDIA SHOULD:
• Develop a gender policy and gender-aware ethics and practice codes, with action 
plans and targets for implementation.
• Engage with community media organizations and citizens’ media networks to 
advance gender equality in content production.
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD:
• Advocate for fair and equal representation of women and men in news media. 
Lobby for gender policy adoption and implementation for and by media; 
25 In Macharia, 2015
61
• Establish gender focussed media watches and apply the results as evidence for 
public and media awareness, for actions to hold media accountable through state, 
industry and media house complaints mechanisms, and to support media houses 
committed to gender equality.
FUNDING AGENCIES SHOULD:
• Support the strengthening or establishment of media watch networks.
• Support media development work that emphasises gender equality in content 
production, media in-house policies and practices.

6. Violence Against Women 
in Media and Digital Contents
Aimée Vega Montiel 26
26 Researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)INTRODUCTION 
 Defined by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly, as any 
distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or 
purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, 
irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, 
civil or any other field, violence against women (VAW) constitutes the main obstacle 
for women’s human rights.
 Based on the theoretical framework of feminism, nowadays legal definitions 
on VAW have adopted a holistic perspective which recognizes both types (physical, 
sexual, psychological, economic and femicide), and modalities (institutional, 
community, workand school) of violence against women and girls.
 Most recently, the Sustainable Development Goal 5 Target 5.2 calls on 
governments and other actors to eliminate all forms of violence against all women 
and girls in the public and private spheres, including trafficking, sexual and other 
types of exploitation. 
 The CEDAW recognizes the centrality of media in the elimination of VAW. Actions 
promoted by the Commission include urging Member States to adopt mechanisms 
67
to eliminate sexist stereotypes in media and advertising, to encourage media to 
establish codes of production and to stimulate a public debate on this issue.
 The Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA) in 1995 called explicitly on governments 
to take effective measures, including appropriate legislation against pornography 
and the phenomenon of violence against women and children in the media (UN, 
1995, p.102). The BPfA also recommended media industries to establish guidelines 
to address violent, degrading or pornographic materials concerning women, 
including advertising and to disseminate information aimed at eliminating all forms 
of violence against women.
 However, instead of decreasing, sexism and misogyny in media has increased 
dramatically the last decades. The initial issues around the accountability of media 
institutions and media actors to end violence against women, are still at the core 
of international debates. In addition, the new media environment has exacerbated 
some existing problems and brings new challenges that need to be addressed – 
such as sex trafficking and misogynistic pornography. 
EVIDENCE 
 Reviewing feminist research during the last 50 years provides evidence of 
the prevalence of violence against women in media contents. In addition, the 
complexity of theoretical and methodological frameworks has increased as types 
and modalities of representing VAW have changed.
 Early studies focused on the representation of sexual violence to demonstrate 
how, through the commodification of women’s bodies, media content contributed 
to the normalisation of sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence and 
how they reinforced gender inequalities. These studies were identified by their 
interdisciplinary nature. Influenced by psychoanalysis, Laura’s Mulvey male gaze 
and sexual objectification categories evidenced the patriarchal order existing in 
the film industry and how these categories discriminated against women in society. 
68
Guided by the questions: “how do media portray women?” and “how do these 
portrayals limit women lives?” sociologist Gaye Tuchman called attention to the 
symbolic annihilation of women in media discourse, through omission, trivialisation 
and condemnation. 
 The next phase was linked to social intervention. Content analysis served to 
produce quantitative statistical data about gender portrayals. These data supported 
campaigns against stereotyped representations in both media contents and 
advertising, which evidenced the presence of different forms and modalities of VAW 
in contents – for example, in regard to domestic violence. 
 Current research promotes holistic analysis, in order to look at different forms 
and modalities of gender-based violence in media discourse (Vega Montiel, 2014) 
Findings have demonstrated how media content reproduces sexist stereotypes 
that associate male identity with violence, domination, independence, aggression 
and power, while women are linked to emotions, vulnerability, dependency and 
sensitivity (Elasmar, Hasegawa and Brain, 1999; McGhee and Frueh, 1980; Thompson 
and Zerbinos, 1995).
 In particular, news reports of violence against women tend to represent women 
as victims and as responsible for the violence of which they are victims. Usually, 
aggressors are not part of news reports. VAW is not shown as a structural problem, 
which is the consequence of inequality between women and men in society, but as 
a mere individual experience that happens in domestic spaces (Diez, 2002; Vega 
Montiel, 2007).
 With the development of ICT, cyber VAW is emerging as a global problem. Almost 
three quarters of women have been exposed to some form of violence online. Types 
of cyber-violence include: hacking, surveillance, harassment, malicious distribution 
and death threats (Broadband Commission for Digital Development, 2015).
69
 The report (cited above) argued that violence online and offline feed into each 
other. ‘Abuse may be confined to networked technologies or may be supplemented 
with offline harassment including vandalism, phone calls and physical assault. 
Similarly, the viral character of distribution is now explosive. What was once a 
private affair can now be instantly broadcast to billions of people across the digital 
world’ (Broadband Commission for Digital Development, 2015: 7).
 In countries such as Mexico, cyber violence has been at the core of public 
debates in recent years. In 2016, at least ten young women denounced through 
social networks they had been harassed by men in public spaces. These women 
identified the alleged aggressors and, in response, they became victims of both 
sexual violence and death threats from Facebook and Twitter users. A very powerful 
counter-response came from young women in the country. Through the hashtag 
#MyFirstHarassment (#MiPrimerAcoso, in Spanish), a hundred thousand women 
told of their first experience as victims of sexual violence. 
 A similar movement emerged in October 2017, in the USA. The hashtag #MeToo 
was used to denounce the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein as a sexual 
aggressor. The hashtag was promptly popularised worldwide for millions of women 
to publicise personal experiences of sexual harassment or assault. 
 At the same time, online and social media have also become new and powerful 
vehicles for misogynistic threats and harassment which can result in the silencing 
of women. While fewer women than men access the Internet today. There are 
currently 200 million fewer women online than men – it is no less the case that 
both new sexist media and new sexist discourses can exacerbate violence against 
women and girls.
 Another dimension of the sexist nature of online discourses, is the widespread 
circulation of pornography. Some statistics suggest that there are more than four 
million websites that offer pornography - 12% of the total number of websites in the 
world. The online pornography industry turns over 97.06 billion dollars per year, 
70
more than Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, Amazon, Netflix and Apple combined (Feminist 
Peace Network, 2006). An estimated 100,000 offer child abuse imagery. 
 There is also sex trafficking of women, girls and boys that has been enhanced by 
the new media. Sex trafficking used to happen mainly in countries that correlate with 
a lack of regulation and policy, including the Internet, and particularly in countries 
where there is a high percentage of poor women. 
 So, what to are the conclusions about violence against women offline and 
online? The initial feminist research questions - coming from the 1960’s - are still 
relevant at the core of theory and research on media contents. ‘This still resolves 
around the most basic questions of power, values, access and exclusion’ (Gallager, 
2002: pp 5).
 In addition, the new media environment has opened possibilities for contestation 
while also exacerbated some existing problems and new challenges that need to be 
addressed.
“Media sexism and male-dominated power structures are continually shifting and 
finding new forms of representation and practice... [so] our critique can never be 
static or one-dimensional, but we must act collectively… Across disciplines and 
sectors and across countries and regions” (Gallagher, 2015). 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 In view of the evidence, we call on the UN and the international community to 
put into global focus the accountability of media and ICT industries in eliminating 
violence against women and girls. This is crucial to promoting discussion and to 
enhancing public visibility and awareness.
71
THE UN AND INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SHOULD:
• Commission and produce global comparative reports on VAW in traditional and 
digital media contents, with a cross-national and cross-regional perspective, 
emphasising advances and challenges. These reports must include the analysis of 
the dimensions involved in this problem: existing legislation, policy and regulation, 
self-regulation and co-regulation forms, content of media and ICT, media and 
information literacy programs.
• Call on Member States to introduce or strengthen regulation and policy aimed at 
preventing the spread of gender-based violence through the media and ICT.
• Encourage media and ICT organizations to: adopt gender mainstreaming mecha -
nisms for monitoring, evaluation and action; adhere to national and internatio -
nal legislation to end VAW; improve gender mainstreaming training programs for 
content producers.
• Encourage media unions and journalists’ groups to adopt basic principles for the 
production of news on VAW free of sexist stereotypes.
• Promote the exchange of best practices to end VAW in media and online contents 
and link with the research community.

7. Violence Against Women Journalists 
– Online and Offline
Julie Posetti and Hannah Storm 27
INTRODUCTION 
 Women journalists face disproportionate risk and experience of violence 
and intimidation for the work they do – both on and offline. They are affected as 
members of a profession that is increasingly becoming a target in conflicts, in the 
context of terrorism, and as a feature of the rising global tide of populist politics. 
They are vilified and attacked for the messages they share and questions they ask. 
In some cases, they are even targeted for daring to speak at all. In addition to the 
risks and threats experienced by their male counterparts, they are also exposed 
to gender-based harassment and violence in the field and in the newsroom. Such 
attacks can be physical or virtual in nature, and they are frequently sexualized. 
 Traditionally, the news industry has been dominated by men. From behind 
the editor’s desk to the front page, it’s men who predominate in prestigious field 
assignments, and men who overwhelmingly have occupied positions of greatest 
power and highest profile (Ross, Boyle, Carter and Ging, 2018). This also translates 
to news content, where male sources and male voices dominate.28 This gender 
27 Julie Posetti is Senior Research Fellow with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the 
University of Oxford. Hannah Storm is Director of the International News Safety Institute (INSI), a UK 
registered charity which focusses on the safety of journalists.
28 Note: The Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) is the largest international study of gender in 
the news media. It has been carried out every five years since 1995. It involves hundreds of volunteers 
collecting data on indicators of gender in the news on one specific day across the world.

imbalance is also reflected in lower salaries29, fewer senior positions held and less 
secure working conditions for women. 
 The newest threats faced by women journalists and media workers (along with 
their female sources) exist in the digital realm, particularly on social media sites. 
These risks range from pernicious, gendered online harassment to overt, targeted 
attacks that frequently involve threats of sexual violence. Increasingly, they also 
include digital security breaches from the exposure of identifying information 
(exacerbating the offline risks) through to malicious misrepresentation using 
Artificial Intelligence technologies.30 
 As a result of these convergent risks, women journalists and media workers are 
both less visible and more vulnerable - a double-edged sword that delegitimises 
their roles, while simultaneously increasing their burdens and taxing their 
resilience. 
 In recent years, women’s involvement in media and in public discourse has 
increased, albeit slowly (Global Media Monitoring Project [GMMP], 2015), but 
this has coincided with a parallel rise in the violence and threats they face. In 
the case of online harassment. Emerging research indicates that the resulting 
chilling effect is causing increasing numbers of women reporters to withdraw from 
public conversation and to leave the profession (Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe [OSCE], 2016).
 News organizations and civil society groups have begun to recognize the scale 
of the problem and moves are now afoot to pay heed to the specific safety issues 
faced by women journalists in some media organisations, within certain countries, 
29 See for example: The BBC’s China Editor Carrie Gracie’s resigned from the Corporation in January 
2018, saying she could not ‘collude’ in a policy of ‘unlawful pay discrimination’ BBC (2018) BBC's Carrie 
Gracie ‘could not collude’ in pay discrimination

and at the international level through media support groups, civil society organi -
sations, journalist unions, regional bodies like the OSCE and the United Nations. 
 The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of 
Impunity (UNESCO, 2012) highlights the need for a gender-sensitive approach in 
relation to the safety of journalists. UNESCO coordinates the plan, which includes 
Journalism Safety Indicators that involve a gendered aspect and training for women 
journalists. In addition, each year UNESCO collaborates with GAMAG on Women 
Make the News, a global initiative to raise awareness of issues relating to gender 
inequality in and through the media. 
 It is crucial that any initiatives focussing on the safety of women journalists 
exist within the broader framework of conversations aimed at meeting the specific 
targets of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 5 to achieve gender equality and 
empower all women and girls, and recognize that much of the violence that women 
journalists face stems from more deeply rooted gender-based discrimination and 
inequality in the media industry, and society at large. 
EVIDENCE 
 Specific data detailing the exact numbers of women involved in journalism vis-
à-vis men globally, and the scale of the violence and intimidation they face, remains 
scarce. UNESCO’s World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development  
report (UNESCO, 2018) notes that while progress has been made, gender equality 
has not been reached. 
31 See: https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews  (Accessed 14/8/18)
32 Note: The Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, are a set of 17 global goals launched in 2015 
by the UN sending an agenda (the 2030 agenda) of achieving 169 targets by 2030. The focus of SDG 5 
is to ‘achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls’ through nine targets, ranging from a 
focus on ended gendered violence to increasing the participation of women in politics.

77
 In November 2017, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution 
(UN 2017b) with a particular gender focus, ‘condemning unequivocally’ all ‘specific 
attacks on women journalists in the exercise of their work, including sexual and 
gender-based discrimination and violence, intimidation and harassment, online and 
offline’. The resolution reflects many of the recommendations in a UN Secretary 
General’s report from earlier in 2017 on the safety of women journalists (UN 2017a) 
which came at a pivotal moment in the history of women’s involvement in journalism.
 The average percentage of women journalists killed between 2006 and 2016 
was seven percent of the total (UNESCO, 2017), but in 2017 that figure rose to 19 
percent of the overall total (Beiser, 2018). The historic difference may be explained, 
in part at least, by the fact that traditionally fewer women journalists have covered 
conflict zones. However, simply pointing to a perceived rise in the numbers of 
women working in war zones in recent years does not adequately account for the 
increased casualty numbers, because most of the women journalists killed in 2017 
were not working in active war zones. Lauren Wolfe, director of the ‘Under Siege’ 
program at the Women’s Media Center, says it could be because women are also 
covering more dangerous beats, as well as reporting from dangerous locations 
(Chacar, 2017). Arguably, it could also be because the risks are spreading to states 
considered as generally lower risk environments for journalists.
 The International News Safety Institute’s 2012 publication, No Woman’s Land: 
On the Frontlines with Female Reporters  (Storm and Williams, 2012) was collated 
after the sexual assault of CBS correspondent Lara Logan in Egypt’s Tahrir Square. 
In it, forty women journalists paint a global picture of the daily risks of mob-related 
attacks, harassment from public officials and sexual advances often perpetrated by 
those who are supposed to protect them in their work. 
 The recent momentum of the #metoo movement has empowered some 
women to share their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse within domestic 
newsrooms in developed democracies, and a number of high profile men alleged to 
have perpetrated these abuses have been fired.33 
78
 In 2014, a joint report by INSI and the International Women’s Media Foundation 
(IWMF, with support from UNESCO) found that women journalists have long-suffered 
sexual violence and harassment at work (Barton and Storm, 2014). Respondents to 
the project survey, completed by almost 1000 women, found that nearly two-thirds 
of respondents had experienced ‘some kind of intimidation, threats or abuse in 
relation to their work’. Most of the incidents had occurred in the workplace and were 
perpetrated by male bosses, supervisors and co-workers. It also found that most 
incidents of harassment and violence were never reported, even though a majority 
of women said it had psychologically affected them. Many women expressed fear 
of repercussions that reporting such abuse could have on their careers, a cultural 
and professional stigma that gender-based violence and harassment still carries 
(Chacar, 2017).
 Any risk assessments that are completed rarely include specific gendered 
considerations, be that how to deal with unwanted harassment from contacts, fixers 
or colleagues, or the need to factor risk into assignment budgets – for example, 
when public transport is likely to be more dangerous than private alternatives. 
Because these structures are generally designed by, and for, men these elements 
simply do not become part of the normative framework. This, again, underscores the 
particular vulnerabilities of certain groups of female journalists, such as freelancers 
and those working in conflict scenarios heavily dominated by men (Harris, Mosdell 
and Griffiths, 2016).
33 Note: In this context, a group of journalists, editors and academics (including the authors of this 
chapter) published an open letter on sexism and misogyny in the news business with 14 recommen -
dations for change. You can read it here: http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/06/how-to-end-misogyny-in-

WOMEN JOURNALISTS AS TARGETS OF SEXUALIZED ONLINE ABUSE 34 
 The newest and broadest threat facing women journalists is the global 
proliferation of online abuse targeting reporters and commentators online. This 
scourge has led the UN (including UNESCO35), the OSCE, IWMF, INSI, Reporters Sans 
Frontiers (RSF, 2018), and other civil society organisations to recognize the problem, 
commissioning research into its impact and calling for actions and solutions.
 Early research highlighting the misogynistic nature of harassment experienced 
by women bloggers in the pre-social media era serves as a beacon for the rampant 
cyber-misogyny now experienced by women journalists in the age of ‘social 
journalism’ (Filipovic, 2007; Seelhoff, 2007; Citron, 2009). The expectation is that 
journalists be actively embedded on social platforms like Facebook and Twitter 
to facilitate the direct audience engagement that is now integral to journalistic 
research, production and content dissemination (Posetti, 2013). This however, has 
placed women media workers on the frontline of a massive problem. The ‘pile on’ 
effect (organic, organized, or robotic mass attacks against a person online) worsens 
the impacts of online harassment experienced by women media workers, along 
with their female audiences and sources (Posetti, 2017b).36 
 About 20% of respondents said they had experienced some form of online 
abuse or attack. Women who report on issues of gender, technology and migration 
also find themselves at greater risk of increased attack according to more recent 
accounts. Also, in 2014, a study by British think-tank Demos, which examined

hundreds of thousands of tweets, found that journalism was the only category 
where women received more abuse than men, with female journalists and TV news 
presenters receiving roughly three times as much abuse (Bartlett, et al., 2014) as 
their male counterparts. The keywords for the abusers were ‘slut’, ‘rape’ and ‘whore’. 
 In 2016, the OSCE published research that demonstrated the international impact 
of online abuse of female journalists, whom it described as being disproportionately 
targeted for ‘hate trolling’. The study found that ‘female journalists, bloggers and 
other media actors are disproportionately experiencing gender-related threats, 
harassment and intimidation on the Internet, which has a direct impact on their 
safety and future online activities’ (OSCE, 2016).37 
 Another hallmark of this online abuse of women media workers (and others 
producing verifiable information in the public interest across a range of digital 
platforms) is the use of disinformation tactics: lies are spread about their character 
or their work as a means of undermining their credibility, humiliating them, and 
seeking to chill their public commentary and reporting. In some instances, journalists 
have been targeted in acts of ‘astroturfing’38 and ‘trolling’39, experienced as deliberate 
attempts to ‘mislead, misinform, befuddle, or endanger journalists’ (Posetti, 2013). 
In other cases, they faced cyberattacks designed to reveal their sources, breach 
their privacy to expose them to risk, identify their sources. Attacks may also aim 
to access their unpublished data through phishing (King, 2014), doxing40, malware 
attacks and identity spoofing.41 Computational propaganda (Woolley and Howard, 
2017) has increased the risks for journalists dealing with ‘astroturfing’ and ‘trolling’.

This involves the use of bots to disseminate well-targeted false information and 
propaganda messages on a scale designed to look like an organic movement. 
Frequently, these attacks involved gendered elements and threats of sexual 
violence. Concurrently, AI technology is being leveraged to create ‘deepfake’ porn 
videos and other forms of content designed to discredit women journalists.
RECOMMENDATIONS 
STATES SHOULD: 
• Act in response to the UN Secretary General’s report (UN, 2017a) on the safety of 
women journalists that urges measures to ‘inform a gender-sensitive approach to 
38 Note: ‘Astroturfing’ is a term derived from a brand of fake grass used to carpet outdoor surfaces to 
create the impression it is natural grass cover. In the context of disinformation, it involves spreading 
fake information, targeting audiences and journalists with an intention to redirect or mislead them, 
particularly in the form of ‘evidence’ of faux popular support for a person, idea or policy. 
See also Technopedia definition: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13920/astroturfing  
(Accessed 20/06/18). 
39 Note: ‘Trolling’ in its Internet related application refers to acts that range from gentle teasing, tricking 
and goading to deliberate deception. However, it is increasingly deployed as a term to cover all acts 
of online abuse. This is potentially problematic as it conflates a wide range of activities and potentially 
underplays the seriousness of online harassment. 
40 From Technopedia: Doxing is the process of retrieving, hacking and publishing other people’s infor -
mation such as names, addresses, phone numbers and credit card details. Doxing may be targeted 
toward a specific person or an organization. There are many reasons for doxing, but one of the most 
popular is coercion. Doxing is a slang term that is derived from the word ‘.doc’ because documents 
are often retrieved and shared. Hackers have developed different ways to dox, but one of the most 
common methods is by obtaining the victim’s email and then uncovering the password to open their 
account to obtain more personal information: https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29025/doxing  
(Accessed 29/03/18).
41 From Technopedia: Spoofing is a fraudulent or malicious practice in which communication is sent 
from an unknown source disguised as a source known to the receiver. Email spoofing is the most 
common form of this practice. A spoofed email may also contain additional threats like Trojans or 
other viruses. These programmes can cause significant computer damage by triggering unexpected 
activities, remote access, deletion of files and more: 
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/5398/spoofing  (Accessed 29/03/18). 
42 The term ‘deepfake’ is a portmanteau of ‘deep learning’ and ‘fake’. It involves AI technology in the 
creation of fraudulent content, sometimes of a pornographic nature, that is virtually undetectable. 
It is used in cyberattacks to discredit people, including journalists. See:

the issue of the safety of women journalists that is located in the broader context 
of gender-based discrimination and inequality’. 
• Follow up the UN General Assembly Resolution (UN, 2017b) on the safety of 
journalists and the issue of impunity which ‘ condemns unequivocally the specific 
attacks on women journalists in the exercise of their work, including sexual 
and gender-based discrimination and violence, intimidation and harassment, 
online and offline’ and also calls upon States  ‘to tackle sexual and gender-based 
discrimination, including violence and incitement to hatred, against women 
journalists, online and offline, as part of broader efforts to promote and protect 
the human rights of women, eliminate gender inequality and tackle gender-based 
stereotypes in society’. 
Additionally, it calls upon  States to: 
‘…create and maintain, in law and in practice, a safe and enabling environment for 
journalists to perform their work independently and without undue interference, 
inter alia…including with a strong focus on combating sexual and gender-based 
discrimination, and violence against women journalists, as well as the particularities 
of online threats and harassment of women journalists; (c) regular monitoring 
and reporting of attacks against journalists; (d) collecting and analysing concrete 
quantitative and qualitative data on attacks or violence against journalists, that 
are disaggregated by, among other factors, sex; (e) publicly and systematically 
condemning violence and attacks; (f)dedicating the resources necessary to 
investigate and prosecute such attacks and to develop and implement gender-
sensitive strategies for combating impunity for attacks and violence against 
journalists, including by using, where appropriate, good practices such as those 
identified in Human Rights Council resolution 33/2;10 and (g) putting in place 
safe gender- sensitive investigative procedures, in order to encourage women 
journalists to report attacks against them and provide adequate support, including 
psychosocial support, to victims and survivors’. 
83
• Follow the UN Action Plan on the Safety of Journalists’ recommendation to 
disaggregate data from a gender-perspective to allow for a better understanding 
of the specific threats facing women journalists.
• Review legal and normative frameworks to determine the applicability of 
existing laws/guidelines and the potential amendment (or introduction of new 
laws/guidelines) to defend the freedom of expression rights of all who produce 
journalism in the public interest (on and offline), being mindful of the need to 
avoid censorship.
• Consider supporting public information campaigns and broad media literacy 
training designed to address the problem.
CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANISATIONS AND MEDIA EMPLOYERS SHOULD:
• Operate a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment in newsrooms (on and 
offline) and the promotion of cultures of inclusion where everyone feels safe to 
speak out about their experiences and empowered to act if they witness something 
inappropriate happening.
• Provide physical security, technical assistance, legal advice and psychological 
support as required when dealing with women journalists affected by sexual 
violence and sexual harassment – on or offline.
• Develop holistic strategies by involving security/cybersecurity staff, senior editors, 
editorial trainers, workplace health and safety teams, social media editors in 
developing and disseminating policies and guidelines when dealing with incidents 
involving offline or online threats, recognising that these problems now interact 
and overlap.43 
• Customise gendered safety training – safety training should be more bespoke. 
Most existing safety training is run by men, and where it does address specific 
84
issues facing women journalists, it is rarely done so sensitively. This requires 
greater understanding of the emotional/psychological aspects of violence that 
impact on women journalists.
• Ensure better access for women in news organizations to the kinds of support 
(confidential where necessary) that they need to help them reintegrate physically, 
psychologically and emotionally, and ensure their careers are not negatively 
impacted if they suffer violence or harassment that requires them to take time 
away from their duties.
• Implement of gender-sensitive safety risk assessments and digital threat 
assessments that are integrated where required.
• Recognise and acknowledgement of the seriousness of online harassment from 
senior management to junior reporters (noting that policies and action plans 
should be disseminated to all staff).
• Escalate early reporting of serious incidents of abuse – on or offline - to the police 
where appropriate.
• Invest in online community engagement management (including clear policies and 
guidelines for intervention, along with adoption and communication of effective 
abuse reporting tools/processes) and adding misogynistic terms to comment 
moderation guidelines.
• Devote editorial resources to coverage of these issues.
43 Note: Several of the recommendations pertaining to online harassment presented here were first 
published by Fairfax Media in an article about the problem written by co-author Julie Posetti in 2016: 
https://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/swedish-broadcaster-alexandra-pascalidou-describes-online-
threats-of-sexual-torture-and-graphic-abuse-20161124-gswuwv.html  (Accessed 20/7/18).
85
• Make a plan to deal with potential online harassment at the commissioning stage 
of ‘lightning rod’ stories (i.e. stories that are likely to attract online harassment of 
women journalists or sources, such as stories about feminism).
• Provide greater support for freelancers and those who are more vulnerable, such 
as interns, women of colour, non-binary people, and members of the LGBTQ 
community.
RESEARCHERS SHOULD:
• Consider the gender aspects and impacts when undertaking research on 
journalism safety and impunity issues.
• Consider the gender aspects and impacts of digital communications issues as they 
affect women journalists and media workers.
• When researching gender issues in media, consider digital and non-digital issues 
in tandem, recognising the interplay of both online and offline experiences.
• Make research of gender-related violence and harassment of women journalists a 
priority to support the defence of women’s freedom of expression rights globally.

INTRODUCTION 
 In 1992, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women  (CEDAW, United Nations, 1992) adopted General Recommendation 
19 which explains that the prohibition of gender based discrimination includes 
violence. State parties to CEDAW must take all the necessary measures to eliminate 
violence, including legal sanctions, civil remedies, preventative measures, (such as 
public information and education campaigns) and protective measures (such as 
support services for women and girls who have experienced violence). 
 DEVAW, or the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women  
was adopted by a UN General Assembly resolution in 1993 (UN, 1993). While the 
Declaration does not create legally binding obligations for States, it does represent 
a clear consensus that ‘violence against women constitutes a violation of the rights 
and fundamental freedoms of women’. The Declaration explains that violence 
against women is ‘a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between 
men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against 
women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women.’ The Beijing 
Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted by the Fourth World Conference on 
Women in 1995 (UN, 1995), calls upon governments to take action to address critical 
areas of concern, among them violence against women. It states; ‘violence against 8. Triple Jeopardy: A Trade Union Perspective on

44 Transgender persons suffer the highest rate of gender-based violence, and a small percentage of 
men and boys who challenge traditional gender roles are also at risk. However, for the purposes of this 
paper, GBV herein refers specifically to violence against women journalists.

women is an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality, development 
and peace. Violence against women both violates and impairs or nullifies the 
enjoyment by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms. The long-
standing failure to protect and promote those rights and freedoms in the case of 
violence against women is a matter of concern to all States and should be addressed.’ 
DEFINING VIOLENCE 
 In 2006, the UN stated, “violence against women and girls is one of the most 
systematic and widespread human rights violations. It is rooted in gendered social 
structures rather than individual and random acts; it cuts across age, socio-economic, 
educational and geographic boundaries; affects all societies; and is a major obstacle 
to ending gender inequality and discrimination globally”, (UN General Assembly, 
2006). It defines violence against women as “any act of gender-based violence that 
results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering 
to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of 
liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life”. Women journalists face triple 
jeopardy: at risk as every other woman; the same risks as our male colleagues; and 
those risks that impact us specifically because we are women journalists, such as 
femicide and sexualized violence. 
 Direct forms of violence include: murder, femicide, sexual violence, death and 
familial threats, imprisonment, abuse of sedition and libel laws, bullying, harassment, 
sexual harassment, domestic partner violence, and online bullying/abuse. Indirect 
forms of violence include: being forced into insecure and temporary work, overt 
and systemic discrimination such as unequal pay for equal work, lack of access to 
training, jobs and promotion, and use of ‘gagging clauses’ or forced mediation. At 
the base, the root and cause of violence against women is inequality.
 Fear of loss of their work, loss of standing in the community or on the job, shame, 
stigma, further abuse and escalating violence, including online, have kept many 
women silent. These fears have a solid and enduring base in impunity; according 
94
to the Dart Center (2017), the impact of harassment is usually avoidance, denial or 
leaving the profession. It rarely ends with confrontation of the abuser. 
EVIDENCE 
INTERNATIONAL FEDARATOIN OF JOURNALISTS’ SURVEY 
 A survey by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ, 2017) showed 
that “almost one in two women journalists have suffered sexual harassment, 
psychological abuse, online trolling and others forms of gender-based violence 
while working”.
 Almost 400 women journalists, across 50 different countries, were surveyed 
with 66% of those that had experienced some form of gender-based violence 
(GBV) acknowledging they had made no formal complaint. Of those that did, 85% 
responded that ‘no or inadequate action has been taken against perpetrators’, and 
that most workplaces (74%) have no reporting or support mechanisms.
 Since the IFJ has been recording killed female journalists, there have been around 
8 deaths reported per year but the true number could be higher as many deaths go 
unreported.For example, in 2015, the Communication and Information on Women 
Organisation, (CIMAC) in Mexico documented 184 cases of violence against women 
journalists since 2002, including 11 deaths - with a sharp increase in reported cases 
of violence since 2010.
 The IFJ Byte Back Campaign  (IFJ, 2017) highlights that the ‘virtual world mirrors 
the ‘real’ world, where women journalists are harassed, excluded and subjected 
to abuse for their work.’ The campaign calls on the public to expose trolling and 
harassment as a critical press freedom violation. Recent reports, including the IFJ 
survey, have cited this form of gender-based violence as the fastest growing.
 The #MeToo Movement has gone a long way to highlight the levels of impunity 
95
in terms of sexual harassment and the women willing to come forward face scrutiny 
and often further harassment and threats of violence. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS SHOULD:
• Through the UN, convene a multi-stakeholder, expert panel to develop an over-
riding strategy to tackle the many levels of gender-based violence and include 
representatives from: unions, states, civil society, academia and NGOs.
• Through the UN, exert more pressure on States that have not yet fully implemented 
already ratified agreements addressing gender-based violence, including CEDAW 
and UN Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.
• Support the ILO Convention against violence in the world of work and pressure 
State actors to ensure other ILO Conventions are fully implemented.
TRADE UNIONS SHOULD: 
Put pressure on and convince their governments that they have a responsibility 
under international human rights law to: 
• Take action to address the causes of domestic abuse and to improve the services 
on offer to the victims.
• Prevent, investigate and punish acts of all forms of violence against women whether 
in the home, workplace, the community or society, in custody or in situations of 
armed conflict.
• Take all measures to empower women.
96
• Condemn violence against women and not invoke customs, traditions or practices in the 
name of religion or culture to avoid their obligations to eliminate violence against women.
• Develop and/or utilize legislative, educational, social and other measures aimed at 
the prevention of violence against women.
• Introduce or strengthen laws to give adequate protection and redress to victims of 
domestic abuse.46
JOURNALISTS’ TRADE UNIONS SHOULD:
• Keep better track of attacks, cases of bullying and harassment and murders of 
journalists, both locally and natoinally.
• Encourage ethical journalist initiatives agreed in collective bargaining as these 
provide a better balance, not only in reporting content, but also in who is labelled 
as experts and who is writing the news.
• Develop guidelines for coping with bullying and harassment (one example is the 
bullying and harassment for freelancers, from the entertainment unions in the 
UK47) and other model agreements, like the Dignity at Work, help to ensure a 
safer work environment and may help to convince employers that bullying and 
harassment may cost too much in terms of lost work hours to sick days.
• Investigate any suspected cases of workplace gender pay gaps to ensure equity of pay.
• Challenge and remove forced arbitration and other forms of gagging clauses that 
silence survivors, or worse protect the business and perpetrators. Instead, shift

97
the focus towards support and protection of survivors.
EMPLOYERS SHOULD: 
• Give a renewed emphasis to combatting sexual harassment at work and to 
implementing workplace guidelines to prevent it.
• Research and monitor workplace policies, including documenting good practice 
agreements and policies in the workplace.
• Provide training programmes on bullying and harassment to ensure that there is a 
gender-dimension that addresses the causes and impacts of sexual harassment at work.
• Indentify sexual harassment as a core workplace health and safety riskthrough 
training programmes that includes specialised training for workplace 
representatives on how to prevent and tackle sexual harassment at work.48 
• Evaluate the risk of violence and ensure constant monitoring to determine potential  
 sources of violence and verify the enterprise’s state of readiness to react to it.
• Implement effective programmes to prevent violence in the workplace, be it verbal, 
physical, psychological or sexual, establishing a system where incidents of violence 
can be reported in confidence and appropriate disciplinary measures applied.
• Provide workers with training on the key elements of an anti-violence programme.
• Ensure that the workplace has a sexual harassment policy that takes into account 
the diversity of women workers.

98
• Protect women journalists working in conflict areas, including local, freelance 
reporters and media workers.
• Teach self-help protection and awareness of the impact of trauma, while acknowledging 
that not all of those who experience violence and abuse are traumatized.
• R that the impact of abuse and violence will be different for each individual and 
educate journalists to raise awareness on impact of trauma.

Digital Media Sphere
9. A Feminist Perspective on Gender, 
Media and Communication Rights in Digital Times
Anita Gurumurthy, Amrita Vasudevan and Nandini Chami 49
INTRODUCTION 
 In 2005, the UN convened the second phase of the World Summit on the 
Information Society (WSIS). The resulting WSIS Tunis commitment acknowledged 
that ‘the full participation of women in the Information Society is necessary to ensure 
the inclusiveness and respect for human rights within the Information Society, 
(encouraging) all stakeholders to support women’s participation in decision-making 
processes and to contribute to shaping all spheres of the Information Society at 
international, regional and national levels.’50
 The digital metamorphosis of society was acknowledged in the 2015 Review of 
the Beijing Platform for Action. Para 311 recognizes that ‘media and information 
and communication technologies are fundamental to women’s and girls’ full and 
effective participation in civil, political, economic and social and cultural life.’51 A 
similar sentiment was expressed by Para 32 of the WSIS plus 10 Review, also in 
2015: ‘we recognize that ending the gender digital divide and achievement of SDG 5 
on gender are mutually reinforcing efforts.’52

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have become an essential 
ingredient of a range of feminist action to advance gender justice.53 Women’s equal 
participation in all domains of life depends on their communication rights, including 
their right to access and use digital technologies.54 This position paper takes stock of 
the constituent processes and structures of the Information Society, looking at how 
digital media promotes or hinders women’s human rights.
THE PUBLIC SPHERE IN DIGITAL TIMES - IMPLICATIONS 
FOR MEDIA PLURALITY, REPRESENTATION 
AND PARTICIPATION 
NETWORK EFFECT AND ENTRENCHMENT OF MEDIA MONOPOLIES 
 In many countries, the Internet is slowly becoming the primary source through 
which news is accessed.55 In the initial years, the Internet’s potential for democratising 
content brought the hope that anyone could be a creator and publisher. However, 
the evolution of the information society has seen a disruption in the news landscape 
that, on the contrary, reflects a centralisation of content, with few digital corporations 
defining what gets consumed.56 Problematic features of old media structures, like 
media consolidation, have transposed onto new media as well. 
53 For example, 99% sexual rights activists (respondents) in the ‘Survey on Sexual Activism, Morality 
and the Internet’ believed that the Internet was useful for their work in advancing sexual rights 
including for public action and support and to network in safe conditions.

56 Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism’s Digital News Report, 2017 shows that more than half 
of 70,000 online news consumers across 36 countries cited social media as a source of news, 
http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/
104
 Building on network effects, the digital behemoths consolidated their market 
share by transforming and acquiring entire sectors.57 As a result, an unprecedented 
vertical integration and monopolistic concentration of power is evidenced across 
sectors, from banking, automobiles to agriculture and news.58 Even though 
possibilities for citizen/community journalism abound, the political economy 
question of whose news is being consumed and shared, still remains relevant in the 
digital age. 
NEO-LIBERAL LOGIC, THE ALGORITHMIC TURN 
AND ENGINEERING OF NEWS
 Another change is the ubiquitous use of algorithms for the processing of 
troves of user data collected by digital corporations. Websites are forced to rely on 
advertising revenues, and so survive on algorithmic/ automated manipulations of 
data and traffic.59 The motivation is to create content or position news stories, as 
far as possible, in a way that is likely to garner traffic and hence, higher revenues. 
While sensationalism is no way an alien concept to media, digital media takes it to 
new heights. This influences how news travels or gets reconfigured, re-assembled, 
buried or amplified. For the majority of women in the global South, the ability to 
express, and the hope of being heard, are dictated by these configurations.
 The neo-liberal logic of online platform companies also implies a perverse 
confluence of interests that allows regressive gender and other ideologies to be 
perpetuated. In an investigation into the source of revenue of extremist websites, 
ProPublica found that a key source of income for many was facilitated through 
commission of ads from digital corporations like Amazon and Newsmax. These 
companies deflect responsibility by taking a laissez-faire approach to political

expression and claiming that the algorithms they employ, and not human 
intervention, are behind such actions.60 
PANSPECTRON61 FOR THE BUSINESS OF BIG DATA  
 The freebie model of the Internet is sustained by exploitative data collection 
practices.62 By monitoring user activity online and analysing their data trails, digital 
corporations violate people’s right to personal autonomy and bodily integrity. For 
instance, through algorithmic analysis, Facebook can ascertain to a great degree 
of accuracy users’ gender, race and sexuality.63 These companies are then able to 
quantify lives and monetise identity by deploying micro-targeted advertisements.64 
For women who wish to conceal their gender online or for sexual minorities who 
are persecuted in the country in which they reside, the lack of anonymity can leave 
them vulnerable. Despite the obvious privacy violation, weak data protection laws 
ensure impunity for violators.65 
 The premium on ‘data driven decision-making’ has led to the mushrooming 
of data brokers and analysts. In 2016, the estimated value of the EU data market 
was EUR 60 billion.66 Key international development actors are increasingly putting 
their weight behind data analytics – such as cases of tackling the Ebola crisis or the

61 The panspectron is a concept that is used to explain the disciplining effect of digital surveillance. It 
refers to a situation where data is being collected about all individuals at all times and then selectively 
recombined or analysed, as needed, to fulfill a set of surveillance requirements. This marks a shift 
from pre-digital surveillance societies which placed select individuals (identified as ‘deviant’ or ‘high 
risk’) in institutions where they visibly felt the disciplining gaze/ ‘eye of the state’ – the panopticon.

Nepal Earthquake. However, ‘hacking for development’ promotes a depoliticised 
solutionism, supplanting and erasing the voices and contexts of subaltern women 
in the name of scientific problem-solving.67 
AGGREGATOR MODEL, DEATH OF PLURALISM 
AND THE BIRTH OF FAKE NEWS 
 Just as they do with targeted advertisements, digital corporations use algorithms 
to push hyper-personalised news results to users. Working under the diktat of the 
attention economy, social media companies employ aggregators to rank news 
and publicise trending topics.68 Even dedicated media outlets are embracing the 
aggregator model.69 
 This paradigm of news dissemination has pushed the kill switch on media 
pluralism. News about socially under-represented groups is unlikely to trend.70 News 
that reflect the realities of marginalised women will hardly ever go viral and become 
mainstream. It is no wonder then that the ASL Ice Bucket Challenge featured more 
prominently than the Ferguson protests, a clear reflection of the skew in Facebook’s 
algorithm ranking system for trending topics.71

 Algorithmic ascription of ‘the sensational’ has also led to the erosion of editorial 
standards and fact checking. This has consequently generated a fecund environment 
for the creation of fraudulent news.72 It is however, the anatomy of social media and 
the preference of the mobile phone as the point of access that has facilitated the 
proliferation of disinformation, posing as news. Affordances of social media such as 
low barriers of entry (negligible fixed costs), the ability to reach a wide audience and 
the fleeting nature of news in these times means that anybody can set up a news site 
without going through the pains of establishing reputational history. Further, since 
social media is designed to provide only short bursts of information (conducive to 
the small screen of a mobile) spotting a hoax story is even more difficult.73
 The method employed - of mining user data to build profiles based on search 
history to recommend news stories - has resulted in the creation of filter bubbles 
in which we only get to see more of the same viewpoint.74 Filter bubbles contribute 
to the perpetuation of fraudulent news, as one is less likely to come across diverse, 
or perhaps, even contradictory news stories.75 With algorithms being contained in 
virtual black boxes, we have no way of knowing why we are reading what we are 
reading.76 
 The Cambridge Analytica case also showed us how using psychometric profiling 
of users’ preferences can be mined and then gamed to push certain viewpoints. 
Feminist publishers have found it hard to keep pace with these Big Data games, 
unable to muster the resources it takes to stay in public memory, or counter the 
retrograde propaganda that is sponsored by the big players.77

108
 Even a celebrated case, such as #MeToo, took its Hollywood origins and the 
staying power of the New York Times  to build momentum, and yet, in many parts of 
the world, it met with limited or little success in mobilising ordinary women78. Under 
the circumstances, creating and disseminating progressive perspectives on gender 
equality and building the foundation for informed debates on deep structures and 
cultures of gender seems to be an uphill task. 
ORGANIZED TROLL INDUSTRY AND SYSTEMIC GAMING 
 Far right groups online, who also happen to enjoy political patronage, have the 
deep pockets and the wherewithal to make fraudulent news a veritable industry 
that can shape public opinion.79 Working as a well-oiled machine, these groups send 
out “thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite 
system of right-wing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the 
mainstream media system”.80 In many places, social media platforms, messaging 
apps like Whatsapp and an online troll army have been used by pro-establishment 
groups to spread doctored communal videos and incitement against minorities.81 
Research shows that governments also seek to leverage social media’s propensity 
for virality to push templated messages to counter negative coverage of policies.82

PLATFORM LOGIC, NON-LIABILITY AND REGULATORY DEFICIT  
 “Platforms”, the nomenclature preferred by digital companies, is a misnomer. 
It allows powerful digital corporations to make the argument that they are passive 
intermediaries. The reality is that social media and digital companies are publishers 
who exercise editorial discretion in ways such as ‘offering incentives to news 
organizations for particular types of content, such as live video, or by dictating 
publisher activity through design standards.’83 For example, social media’s design 
for maximising virality works as a disincentive for the creation of detailed pieces 
that engage deeply with an issue. If an article on the inhumane working conditions 
of women employed in garment factories in the global South exceeds the 280 
character limit of Twitter, it could end up as ‘tl;dr’ (short for ‘too long, didn’t read’).84 
 Decisions taken by platforms end up hurting women’s online freedoms of 
association, expression and access to information. Facebook, for example, pulled 
down the page of an organization that provided information on how abortion pills 
can be accessed in countries where such access is restricted, on the premise that 
the page promoted drug use. This was in spite of evidence that the information 
followed the protocols of the World Health Organization.85 
 Yet, social media giants insist that they are a mere conduit - a platform where 
third party content is hosted and consumed; and since they are not content 
producers, they should be immune from regulation of the kind of news circulating 
on their services. What this ideology of exceptionalism translates into is a 
reproduction of social prejudice, sexism and misogyny through actions of omission 
and commission by platform companies. On the one hand, search results throw up 
predominately affirmative responses to ‘are women evil?’ where blame is attributed

GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE ONLINE  
PERVASIVE NATURE OF ONLINE VIOLENCE 
 For many women, the Internet represents a public, open space into which 
they can escape, where they can exist beyond persecution and in which they feel 
empowered to express and build friendships. The emancipatory gains that the 
Internet provides are, however, severely curtailed by acts of gender-based violence 
perpetrated online. World over, women’s participation online has been stymied by 
norms that allow cultures of gendered violence to perpetuate offline and online. 
A report by the UN Broadband Commission for Digital Development stated that a 
staggering 73% of women across the world have already faced cyber violence.88 
POOR TRACK RECORD OF DIGITAL COMPANIES IN TACKLING ONLINE GENDER 
BASED VIOLENCE, OPAQUE POLICIES AND IMMUNITY FROM THE LAW

89 Findings from a survey conducted by the European Agency for Fundamental Rights on Violence 
Against Women in EU with 42000 female residents aged 18-74 years, show that one in 10 women had 
experienced inappropriate advances on social websites or subjected to sexually explicit emails or text 
(SMS) messages, https://globalvoices.org/2014/03/10/european-union-publishes-comprehensive-sur -
vey-of-violence-against-women/ . A nine country study across developing countries across Asia, Africa 
and Latin America revealed that 13% of the women respondents who used social media expressed 
that they had suffered abuse through e-mails or social media. Due to the high possibility of underre -
porting by women in those countries, the report cautions that the percentage could be much higher,

111
however, have been slow to react to gender-based violence perpetrated through 
their services. They have also been poor arbitrators for women, especially from 
the global South, seeking redress from gendered violence encountered on their 
services. Three leading tech companies (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube), tested 
by Take Back the Tech for their response to gender-based violence, performed 
dismally.90 
 The terms of use and opaque internal policies of these corporations betray 
inauthentic attempts at gender justice. Leaked Facebook internal guidelines for 
taking down of violent content revealed that the company had bench-marked for 
take-down a very white male experience of violence, ignoring the complex nature 
of online violence and hate speech that women face.91 Research by ProPublica also 
shows that Facebook’s ‘hate-speech rules tend to favour elites and governments 
over grassroots activists and racial minorities’.92 Internal rules that guide the teams 
of human censors employed by social media corporations remain a mystery.
  The task of adjudicating violations necessitates adequate knowledge of 
the context, and the sensitivity to trace the power relations operating within 
that particular context. Algorithmic decisions tend to be by template and hence 
unresponsive to the particular manifestations of discrimination arising from the 
highly contextual intersections of gender, race, caste and/or other locations. 
 The Cambridge Analytica episode has drawn attention to the place of ethical 
codes and self-regulation within social media corporations. However, as Article 
19 argues, without appropriate institutional frameworks and mechanisms that 
can access the logic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and examine its validity and

appropriateness vis-a-vis human rights, corporate self-regulation is, in and of itself, 
unlikely to be adequate93. Therefore, stakeholders need to be able to hold Internet 
intermediaries accountable, and to do so within reasonable exceptions that do not 
infringe on fundamental freedoms.
TRANSFER OF DATA FROM THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH 
 The flow of personal data of citizens from the global South into the hands of states 
and corporations situated in the global North has raised critical questions about 
control over individual citizens and communities.94 In the name of development, 
women’s bodies become sites for experimentation with big-money being pumped 
into various experiments in the ‘developing world’. For example, organizations like 
ARROW have documented the rise of apps that monitor menstruation and fertility 
with little regard for women’s privacy and how this sensitive data may be used.95 
THE CHILLING EFFECT OF SURVEILLANCE 
 Free speech and access to information, the cornerstones of a robust democracy, 
are reduced to a farce in the surveillance regime. The chilling effect of surveillance 
on speech is well-documented.96 For gender minorities, who are already 
disproportionately subject to online violence, the added threat of surveillance 
is a double whammy. Studies have also shown that people who live in fear of 
being watched will avoid looking for ‘controversial’ information that might draw

suspicion.97 There have also been instances of governments tapping into electronic 
communication of individuals to apprehend the work of Sexual and Reproductive 
Health and Rights (SRHR) and other gender rights activists.98 In a surveillance regime, 
it is then entirely plausible that fear of being ‘found out’ might prevent women and 
gender and sexual minorities from seeking out crucial SRHR material.99 
DIGITAL REGIMES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
AND THE ENCLOSURE OF KNOWLEDGE 
COPYRIGHT MAXIMALISM THROUGH DRMS AND TPMS 
 Access to knowledge is curbed by unfair trade and intellectual property regimes 
that apply proprietary frameworks to information resources, from which women 
have been traditionally excluded. Women’s rights scholars have critiqued this 
possessive individualism underpinning copyright law, highlighting how it excludes 
ideas of shared and public ownership.100 
 The way copyright law is presently formulated perpetuates the ownership of 
creative resources by men, sustaining unequal economic relations between men 
and women. For example, copyright’s impact in terms of depleting resources of 
public libraries directly impacts women who depend on public libraries to access 
information.101
 Although the Internet is a potent force for the dissemination of information at 
negligible costs for reproduction, the neo-liberalisation of the information society 
has seen large scale control by corporations of information and knowledge. Digital

rights management (DRM) and technology protection measures (TPM) are used 
to lock up copyrighted content on the Internet. These measures have become 
commonplace in copyright law post the two WIPO Internet treaties,102 and assume 
a maximalist stance that fails to recognize the need for differential access. The 
divisions in access to knowledge are not just between the North and South,103 but 
also gendered. Unequal earning capacity and lack of control over financial resources 
prevents most women from being able to access copyrighted works.104 DRMs and 
TPMs erect barriers that copyright laws explicitly allow.105 
EQUITABLE ACCESS 
TO DIGITAL COMMUNICATION ARCHITECTURE 
A PERSISTENT GENDER GAP IN ACCESS 
  Globally, 250 million fewer women than men are connected to the Internet.106 
While the gender digital divide is true across all the regions of the world, in Africa, 
the gender gap is widening.107 
 The persistence of the gender digital divide requires us to rethink connectivity 
policies that rely on the free market to reach connectivity to the last person.108 
Over-reliance on private actors can create distortions, such as when users think 
the Internet is just Facebook.109 Further, for women, who on average earn 25% less 
102 WIPO Internet Treaties are World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty, and World 
Intellectual Property Organization Performances and Phonograms Treaty. Despite not ratifying either 
of these, sue to international pressure, India has amended its copyright law to include provisions that 
penalize the circumvention of DRMs.

than men, the cost of connecting to the Internet in the laissez faire economy is often 
simply beyond their means.110 
 MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO ACCESS AND USE  
 Gender-blind connectivity policies are woefully unaware of social, cultural, 
political and economic impediments that dictate women’s use of technology. Cyber-
based gendered violence, lack of textual literacy, social monitoring of access and use 
of technology, the wage gap, dearth of relevant content in local languages, gendered 
division of labour and time burdens, all pose barriers to women’s meaningful use of 
technology. A study on connectivity among urban poor in nine developing countries 
by Women’s Rights Online Network shows that because of a combination of these 
barriers, women were 50% less likely to use the Internet as compared to men111. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
GLOBAL ORGANISATIONS SHOULD:
• Through the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), take forward its work 
on shaping the digital agenda for women’s empowerment and gender equality, 
building on the progress made at its 55th and 57th Session. In its 55th Session, the 
CSW had highlighted the need for gender responsive design of technological 
innovations to ensure that they address women’s needs and priorities and expand 
women’s access to information sources and learning opportunities through online 
spaces.112 In its 57th Session, the CSW had called attention to the proliferation of 
violence against women and girls, and privacy violations online113. 
111 http://webfoundation.org/docs/2015/10/womens-rights-online21102015.pdf
112 https://www.itu.int/en/action/gender-equality/Documents/GlobalPlatformReferences.pdf
113 ibid
116
• Emphasise through the CSW, the significance of a rights-based approach to access, 
underscoring that women’s access to the Internet, first and foremost, needs to be 
unfettered and unconditional.
• Ensure that the Agenda 2030 review processes address the interconnectedness of 
Goals 16, 5b and 9c.
• Encourages a strong role for standards setting on anti-discrimination in outcomes 
of AI systems in media at the global level through a democratic and inclusive 
process; and proactive interventions from the Committee on the Elimination of all 
forms of Discrimination Against Women to tackle gender-based violence online.
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:
• Through the Financing for Development Addis Ababa Action Agenda (2015), resolve 
“to undertake legislation and administrative reforms to give women equal rights 
with men to economic resources, including access to ownership and control over… 
appropriate new technology”. This commitment should serve as a key basis for 
policies and programmes to support women’s empowering use of digital media, 
backed by dedicated budget lines.
• Review, update and upgrade laws in order to keep pace with the changing 
landscape, addressing platform monopolies and their accountability. A legal 
framework defining the scope of intervention for Internet intermediaries in 
addressing online violence must be devised. This must be backed by due 
institutional process and judicial oversight, so that women users dissatisfied with 
the complaints mechanisms of social media have alternative recourse.114 
114 States have attempted walk this legal tightrope, an example of the same is New Zealand’s Harmful 
Digital Communication Act 2015 
https://www.itforchange.net/index.php/rethinking-legal-institutional-responses-to-e-vaw
117
• Hold companies to account who have have shifted to using Artificial Intelligence 
to enforce their terms of service. Even when they do declare that they abide by 
technical and ethical standards, these are usually inscrutable and, therefore, 
there is no way to hold them accountable. Enforceability remains a problem with 
such self-regulatory standards.115 Therefore, institutional safeguards that include 
frameworks for algorithmic transparency, that incorporate methods such as third 
party audits, are necessary. Algorithm audits provided by the EU General Data 
Protection Regulation suggest useful pointers in this regard.116
• Ensure online public-interest content produced by women’s groups is promoted 
through appropriate policies for subsidised broadband connectivity, local language 
content creation and so on.
• Provide institutional and policy measures that promote safe and enabling online 
spaces for women. This includes building a legal response – updating existing laws 
or introducing digitally specific ones – to technology-mediated violence against 
women that recognizes women’s agency, and adopts a ‘dignity and equality’ 
approach against a moralistic framing of the issue.117 
• In keeping with their extra-territorial obligations, countries where digital 
corporations are headquartered must co-operate with those in which platforms 
have not acted against violations of women’s human rights to hold platforms 
accountable.
• Ensure administrative, juidicial and parliamentary oversight of patriarchal 
surveillance with the male elite of local communities that seeks to discipline

women in the emerging social, political and economic spheres. Women and girls 
must have access to information about their rights and avenues for remedy if 
victimized by such surveillance. 
• Incorporate expansive exemptions of national copyright law especially for 
educational material for teaching and research purposes, as well as to include 
women’s traditional knowledge.118 
• Develop connectivity policies that are gender responsive for ICTs to work for 
gender equality and women’s empowerment (Goal 5b),119 and for ‘universal and 
affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020’ (Goal 9c).. 
Policies for universal access must be sensitive to gender barriers and adopt multi-
pronged strategies:
 - A rights-based approach to the Internet can recognize women as equal 
participants in the online public sphere. Also, state provisioning of the Internet 
as a public good can address affordability concerns that act as barriers for 
women. A rights-based approach also calls for an independent regulator who 
can ensure that the Internet remains gender inclusive and is not captured 
by vested interests. To enable marginalised women to enjoy the gains of 
connectivity, the regulator should promote policies in spectrum allocation, 
backhaul inter-connectivity, competition and intellectual property that keep 
the Internet affordable for women.120 
 - Public access centres or public Wi-Fi spots should have women facilitators and

 - Gender budgeting mechanisms are a must in infrastructural policy – including 
for building public access centres and Wi-Fi hotspots, setting up municipal 
broadband networks, providing a minimum universal data allowances, etc.
• Enable women, especially from marginalized locations, to access content and 
engage actively, not just as consumers but creators of media and content, through 
policies for the widespread adoption of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) 
and Creative Commons (CC) licensing. The deepening of such a public domain will 
have positive consequences not only for women’s information access, but also, 
media participation.122 
• Encourage efforts by women’s organizations in using digital media and online 
spaces to amplify their stories through digital literacy programmes which have 
a gender component that specifically focusses on building the information and 
media literacies of marginalized women.123 
CIVIL SOCIETY SHOULD:
 Civil society actors working in the space of women’s rights, digital rights and 
media freedoms should undertake the following set of actions:
• Combine forces to highlight and resist the unjust actions of powerful transnational 
corporations and state excesses in the digital media space. Advocacy efforts 
towards Goal 16, Goal 5b and Goal 9c should be synergised to ensure women’s 
communication rights are comprehensively addressed in Agenda 2030 review 
processes.
122 http://journals.kent.ac.uk/index.php/feministsatlaw/article/view/7/54#txt2
123 An excellent example of this is Khabar Lahariya, a news network run by marginalized rural women, 
in India, that covers media-dark areas. Published in local dialects, it effectively uses digital platforms to 
publish their stories. http://khabarlahariya.org/,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khabar_Lahariya
120
• Become news creators and build dedicated audiences. Diversity in, and the 
localization of, news from a feminist perspective can be achieved only through 
bottom-up networking and network building. Posing a systemic challenge to 
distortions in the public sphere requires that women’s organizations capture the 
lived experiences of women, document the detail, invest in their own servers and 
set up news agencies. Piling one’s content onto market-led media platforms is not 
enough, and may even be harmful in the long run. 
• Carry out research. Global to local research on the rapidly changing media 
landscape is vital. This must include generating evidence about women’s varied 
use of the internet for expression, information access and networking, as well as 
the subjects of industry structures and laws governing media.
• Actively call for private sector accountability to human rights, including women’s 
human rights.124 Women’s groups must advocate for social media policies 
and terms of use that defer to the rule of law and to due processes of justice, 
demanding corporate transparency and accountability. 
• Be vigilant about enclosures of knowledge. The dominance of copyright in the 
information economy calls for active commitment of women’s groups to open 
source software and informational resources. It also requires monitoring of global 
to local policy processes, such as the debates around the Broadcasters Treaty at 
WIPO.125 Restrictions to the public domain in the name of safeguards against on -
line piracy are bound to work against the interests of women.126

122SECTION IV.  
Media Education
10. Gender Mainstreaming in Media 
and Journalism Curricula127
INTRODUCTION 
 The Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women (1995) Section ‘J’ on women and 
the media, called the attention on the centrality of media and ICTs for gender equality.  
Echoing the Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), the 47th Session of the Commission 
on the Status of Women (CSW) in 2003 noted the responsibility of these industries 
to end the discrimination of women. More recently, the Sustainable Development 
Goal 5 also referred to the role of media and ICTs in women’s empowerment.
 Recommendations emerging from these initiatives include: combating sexist 
representations in media and ICT content; equal access and participation of women 
in media and ICTs industries, particularly to foster the participation of women in 
decision-making positions; access of women and girls to ICTs; development of 
gender sensitive media and ICT policy; and the promotion of media and information 
literacy programs for women and girls.
 However, progress has been slow and some areas have moved backwards - for 
example, the extended proliferation of violence against women in media and digital 
representations. One potential reason for the lack of progress is the absence of 
gender mainstreaming in higher education and of curricula that are gender sensitive 
within media and journalism programs globally. The institutions involved prepare

123
future media and ICT professionals and journalists. Changes in curricula must be 
relevant to, and meet the needs of, communication and information industries 
whilst also educating emerging media and journalism practitioners to understand 
the importance of creating gender sensitive media structures and content. To 
date, they have often concentrated on technological innovation, but not on the 
implications of the production of content for gender equality or on the importance 
and significance of gender equity processes, or understanding of participation (and 
barriers to it) for gender equality. 
EVIDENCE 
 Since the publication of the Beijing Plan of Action (BPFA)in 1995, institutional 
efforts were concentrated in combating sexist stereotypes in media and ICT 
content. Gender sensitivity in media and journalism education was not regarded 
as the starting point to change media content and operations. It has been thanks 
to the influence of feminist scholars who, in linking with activists and women 
media workers, that public attention has been drawn to this issue, and that 
education has been recognized as a strategic domain to promote change. Most 
recently, the UNESCO UNITWIN University Network on Gender Media and ICTs 
has been highlighting the centrality of gender mainstreaming in the curricula 
of communication and journalism schools, to combat gender inequality in those 
institutions and the industries they feed. 
 To teach gender issues in journalism and communication schools has to do with 
understanding the construction and impact of the gendered production of media content, 
and also with the status of women in newsrooms, professional career opportunities, 
equal pay and eradication of sexual harassment, among other issues (North, 2010).
 According to Gertseema (2014), gender mainstreaming in journalism was 
adopted first by the Inter Press Service News Agency, which implemented this policy 
in 1994 to improve gender equality in both media structures and news content.
 Following this, together WACC and the IFJ launched the Learning Resource Kit for 
124
Gender-Ethical Journalism and Media House Policy  in 2012, a resource to promote 
gender ethical journalism. The kit is based on the insights of media practitioners, 
educators and scholars from all regions of the world. It includes guidelines for 
gender equality in media contents and encourages dialogue within media structures 
and self-regulatory bodies and NGOs.
 Implementing the gender mainstreaming principle in the media and journalism 
education field, relates to a diversity of dimensions: 
• Institutional normative framework – gender equality and gender mainstreaming 
principles implemented throughout the curricula; including through the adoption 
of a code and/or mechanisms to prevent discrimination, unequal treatment, and 
harassment, as well as to foster gender-responsive pedagogical approaches and 
consistent content.
• Promotion of parity of male and female students and scholars at schools, in all 
activities and programs.
• Curricula development and course content – existence of gender specific courses 
within programs that should be planned through a gender-sensitive perspective. 
• Teaching/learning - lecturers and students training on feminist theories and me -
thodologies, also building on the richness of gender analyses and approaches. 
• Learning materials – inclusion of texts, readings and pedagogical materials on 
gender equality, gender analysis, intersectionality.
• Assessments – gender equality as a standard criteria in university assessment tools.
• Research/publications – draw upon/foster and support research and publications 
that focus on gender in media and communication (Made, 2009), with the inclusion 
of publications and research that was written by both women and men.
125
 Using this model, the South African NGO GenderLinks conducted an audit of 
gender equality in media and journalism education in two Namibian universities, 
including with funding from UNESCO. Findings revealed lack of a formal gender policy 
at the institutional level and the absence of gender mainstreaming in the curricula. 
They also showed a dearth of gender specific courses and a lack of mechanisms 
to mainstream gender into undergraduate programs. The audit made evident that 
the incorporation of gender-related issues mostly depends on the lecturer’s own 
knowledge and on her/his feminist interests (Made, 2009); a situation that resembles 
the broader reality of media and journalism courses across the world.
 Indeed, similar results were found by North (2010) in a national study which 
included 30 universities in Australia. According to the study, no academic journalism 
program in Australia offers courses that address the portrayal of women in the 
media, neither gendered media culture nor gendered production of content. A 
few of them just include some aspects of gender in unit synopses. Also, women 
students outnumber men in communication and journalism programs in a ratio 
of approximately 2:1. However, according to North (2010, p. 104) there is an 
institutional resistance to including feminist theoretical or critical pedagogies in 
Australian journalism curricula. Thus, the lack of gender mainstreaming in curricula 
seems to be the consequence not only of the beliefs, values, knowledge and 
experiences of the course developers, but also of the patriarchal structure that 
resists the introduction of a feminist perspective in teaching (North, 2010). 
 Although there are exceptions, in most cases female students outnumber male 
students, and yet, when they enter the professional field, women tend to have less 
status. They occupy the lower-income positions and have difficulty reaching parity 
within media and ICT industries - including in gaining senior and managerial roles in 
media organizations – which, in turn, has an impact in media content. 
 This raises the question of why there is still resistance to introducing gender 
mainstreaming in the curricula of journalism and communication schools. North 
offers some insight into the importance of gender mainstreaming: 
126
 ‘To find reasons why journalism education should embrace gender in its 
curriculum, one just has to ask why men dominate in the editorial hierarchy. 
Why is sexual harassment a continuing problem in the newsroom and effectively 
unaddressed by media organizations? Why is there a disproportionate number of 
men graded higher than women of equivalent industry experience? And why are 
women more cynical about the industry?’ (North, 2010: 111).
RECOMMENDATIONS 
 In view of the evidence, the UNESCO UNITWIN University Network on Gender 
Media and ICTs calls on governments, member states, UN agencies, universities, 
researchers, civil society organizations and media and ICT industries to implement 
the actions listed below:
• A policy and a plan of action on gender equality should be in place/adopted by 
universities, particularly where journalism and communication programs are 
offered.
• All universities should guarantee gender mainstreaming in their journalism and 
communication programs (as per the above dimensions) with a special attention 
to digital transformations that have gendered implications for the profession. 
• Gender mainstreaming practices need to incorporate intersectional approaches to 
ensure a fully inclusive educational offer.
• With the support of the universities represented at the UNESCO UNITWIN University 
Network on Gender Media and ICTs, there is a need to promote the exchange of 
expertise, knowledge, materials and best practices for the development of gender-
sensitive curricula in journalism and communication.
127
• Governments, Member States, UN agencies, and universities should allocate ade -
quate resources should conduct research on gender equality in journalism and 
communication teaching programs, in view of strengthening a gender-aware ap -
proach to the educational offer.
• Through curricula that embed gender mainstreaming, there is a need to train 
gender-aware next generation professionals to contribute to implementing 
gender equality principles and gender equal practices in both media structures 
and content.
• Universities should conduct gender-focused monitoring of students’ performance 
during education and after graduation.

132CASE STUDIES
Case 1. The Broadcast Media Regulators: 
Gender Equality Drivers 
Amina Lemrini Elouahabi 128
INTRODUCTION 
 Despite the fact that its role is not well known, the broadcast regulator 
constitutes – through its mission and prerogatives – a main driver of the promotion 
of a media landscape that upholds democratic values, including gender equality 
in and through the audiovisual media. The aim of this position paper is to create 
awareness on the ‘ raison d’être ’ of the content regulators, in relation to gender 
equality, through highlighting the Moroccan experience of the High Authority of 
Audiovisual Communication.
WHO ARE THE REGULATORS 
OF THE AUDIOVISUAL MEDIA? 
 As outcomes of the democratic processes and the consolidation of fundamental 
freedoms, including freedom of opinion and of expression, these regulatory bodies 
are created and organized by law to accompany the liberalization of the sector. 
Mainly independent, executive power and from political and economic lobbies, 
these autonomous bodies act in the interest of the public through the prism of the 
128 President of the Moroccan High Authority of Audiovisual Communication. 
Co-President of the Working Group ‘Gender and Media’ of the Network of African Communication 
Regulatory Bodies (RIARC) 
Former Co-President of the Working Group ‘Gender and Media’ of the Network of the Mediterranean 
Bodies of Regulation (RIRM -2013-2015)
133
public and private media.129 They are accountable to parliaments and jurisdictions of 
financial control, and their decisions are liable to be overturned by judicial processes.
 By their raison d’être, the regulators watch over the balance between free 
competition and the principles of public interest, such as media pluralism and the 
diversity of media content. Additionally, they uphold freedom of communication, 
as a fundamental principle, by making sure that media respect human dignity, 
protect the young public, promote pluralism of thoughts and expression, as well 
as of cultural diversity, and contribute generally to the promotion of human rights, 
including equality of the sexes. 
 Of course, the institutional posture and the extent of powers of the regulator, 
and its fields of intervention, differ from one country to another. However, apart 
from the prerogatives of granting authorization of frequencies to radio and 
television stations, the majority of these bodies are endowed with the prerogatives 
of decision-making on regulations, monitoring and sanctions when necessary, 
alongside their capacity to make propositions. 
WHAT IS THEIR PRESENCE AT THE GLOBAL LEVEL? 
 The majority of the audiovisual regulatory bodies came about in the years 1980-
1990. They number about 100 bodies130 today. They are organized into, more or 
less, ten formal networks on a geographic basis (Africa, Europe, Mediterranean), 
linguistic (francophone, ibero-american, lusophone), or cultural (Islamic world).
 These networks meet frequently (annually or bi-annually) to touch base 
and establish road maps; they constitute platforms for common reflection and 
exchanges of experiences, expertise and good practice.
129 UNESCO adds the category of Community Media alongside public and private, as an holistic vision 
of broadcast pluralism.
130 Some bodies, such as the HACA, belong to more than one Network.
134
 The question of gender equality is one of the main thematic areas on which the 
exchanges have resulted in the adoption of solemn Declarations of Commitment, as 
well as working groups for follow-up. These are: 
• REFRAM (Réseau francophone des régulateurs des medias / the French Network of 
Media Regulators): Declaration of REFRAM  on equality between men and women 
in media (Brussels, 2011)131 
• RIRM: Declaration of RIRM  (Mediterranean Network of Regulatory Authorities) on 
fighting gender-based stereotypes in audiovisual media (Lisbon, 2012)132 ; 
WHAT CAN REGULATORS DO 
TO FAVOUR GENDER EQUALITY? 
 First of all, owing to the peculiarities of the audiovisual sector and of the role 
of the regulators,133 the latter are entrusted with a strategic mission vis-a-vis the 
stakeholders: it is about broadcasaters exercising their editorial freedom and 
respect of fundamental liberties and freedoms, including the right of women not to 
be discriminated against.
 It is in the vein of that basic paradigm that gives freedom and equality the 
same normative and ethical values as founding principles of human rights that the 
regulators can and should: 134

135
• Contribute to the legal recognition of gender equality in the media by consistently 
giving their opinions on all bills that the government and parliament consider on 
the media sector.
• Set the legal obligations of broadcast stakeholders in terms of gender equality in 
their bill of specifications. The bill of specifications is the contractual base between 
the regulator and the stakeholders, such as in licence conditions.
• Monitor gender mainstreaming  in the adoption of norms in different fields 
authorized by law, such as happens with the norms that are specific to the 
treatment of political pluralism.
• Monitor the progress of implementation of the bill of specifications by stakeholders 
in line with the law, including the monitoring of sexist stereotypes and efforts to 
promote gender equality. The shortcomings observed during the monitoring can 
be sanctioned.
• Assist stakeholders and media professionals by setting up a methodological 
framework, such as a grid of gender indicators to be applied to different types of 
programmes (information, fiction, entertainment, advertisements), as well as tools 
of sensitization, training, monitoring, etc.
• Produce gender sensitive data in relation to the representation of men and women 
and their relationship across the overall programmes and audiovisual services in 
terms of a mechanism for monitoring reception, storage, archiving, follow-up and 
treatment of the overall programmes broadcast by stakeholders.
• Establish partnerships targeting the promotion of gender equality:
 - At national level (beyond the broadcaster stakeholders) with other actors such 
as advertisers, producers, journalists training institutes, academic institutions, 
civil society, etc. 
136
 - At international level: intra and inter-network relationships, as well as with 
actors of the media sector. 
RECOMMENDATIONS  
 The objective of promoting gender equality in and through the audiovisual 
media is generally shared by all regulators. In order for the role of regulators to be 
meaningful, three types of recommendations can be considered: 
1. General recommendation:
Explicitly acknowledge regulators as stakeholders able to have an added value in MOROCCAN AUDIOVISUAL COMMUNICATION HIGH AUTHORITY  
The Regulator has been instrumental in the integration of the question of 
gender equality through adopting a conceptual framework based on a Gender/
Rights approach.
1 - AUDIOVISUAL ACT (2015- 2016): 
The law obliges the stakeholders to: 
• ‘Promote the culture of equality among women and men, as well as fighting 
gender-based discrimination, including stereotypes that affect the dignity  
of women’ (Art. 8); 
• ‘Uphold the principle of parity in all political, economic, social and cultural 
programmes’ (Art. 8).  
Additionally, the law forbids: 
• ‘Any programme inciting, directly or indirectly, violence, exploitation or 
harassment of women, or likely to affect their dignity’ (Art.9); 
• ‘Any advertisement that is likely to affect women, that contains a negatively 
stereotyped message to them, that suggests their inferiority or calls for their 
discrimination based on sex’ (Art. 2).
2 - REORGANIZING THE HIGH AUTHORITY OF AUDIOVISUAL 
COMMUNICATION ACT (2016): 
Among the missions of the HACA, 
‘Contribute to the promotion of the culture of equality and parity between 
women and men, as well as fighting discrimination and stereotypes affecting the 
dignity of women’ (Art 3, Paragraph 7).
137
advancing gender equality in and through the media (such as advocacy for a new 
paragraph in existing legislation).
2. Recommendations for states to strengthen the role of regulators: 
• Integrate explicitly and transversally the principle of ‘men/women equality’ in the 
laws that organize regulation bodies and other laws in relation to the sector.
• Integrate gender equality information into the principle of parity for conditions of 
election/nomination into the deliberating organs of the regulatory body.
• Endow the regulatory bodies with the explicit prerogative of combatting sexist 
stereotypes and promoting parity and equality in and through audiovisual media.
• Entrust the regulators with the elaboration of annual reports addressed to 
parliaments on the state of gender equality in and through the media, with 
the objective of evaluating and analysing the progress, constraints and making 
recommendations.
• For actions of regulators of broadcasters and other media actors to be efficient 
and meaningful, the conceptual framework of that action should be reviewed. In 
terms of objectives to achieve, it is a question of the basis of the imperatives of 
a legal approach and gender tools to move from the ‘improvement of the image 
of women in the media’ to the ‘fight against sexist stereotypes and the promotion 
of a culture of equality between men and women’. Behind simple terminologies 
lies a worldview of gendered social relationships that media have the power to 
reproduce or deconstruct. 
138
Case 2. African Union of Broadcasting: 
Gender Integration in African media
Evelyne Faye 135
INTRODUCTION 
 The United Nations Conference on women, held in 1995, underscored the essential 
role of media in the promotion of gender equality in all domains. The stakeholders 
agreed on the necessity of pooling their efforts to fight the stereotyped images of 
women and their unequal access and participation in all systems of communication.
 In 2003, during the second African Union summit in Maputo (Mozambique), the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa136 
commonly known as the ‘Maputo Protocol’ was adopted. 
  With the Maputo Protocol, the African Union had adopted an instrument aimed 
at correcting the precarious legal situation of women by engaging the countries that 
ratified it to take concrete measures to ensure equality of men and women. Thus, 
it was the first time that there existed a contractual document that responded to 
all arguments and critics pretending that equality of the sexes was only a western 
preoccupation, and that any effort in that sense would constitute an ‘interference in 
the culture and traditions’ of the peoples in the South. 
 The UN Conference on Women in 1995 denounced stereotypes in the media and 
called on media professionals to define and adopt codes and/or editorial guidelines 
that are gender sensitive to give an impartial and accurate image of women.
135 African Union of Broadcasting 
136 An additional protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights of 1986
139
 African governments indicated commitment to promote the equality of the 
sexes and the self-reliance of women by ratifying the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.137 Recently, the African Union 
declared 2010-2020 the decade of African women. This commitment put the African 
audiovisual media at the forefront of translating that responsibility into action. There 
is a huge gap to bridge in the media and journalistic works in order for women to 
enjoy the same rights as men. The media should truly reflect the image of a society 
where gender equality is a fundamental human right.
 Over the past decade, the question of ‘women and the media’ has been the topic 
of many works and seminars in most of sub-Saharan African countries. International 
organizations such as UNESCO, researchers, national authorities, academic bodies, 
media organizations and women’s’ organizations have, at different levels, raised the 
question of the presence of women in the media.
  While the number of women employed in the media has considerably increased, 
that increase has not translated into their presence in leadership positions in the 
media and has not impacted on the representation of women within content. They 
are confined within the roles of news bulletin anchors and are less present as 
reporters where men are mainly assigned. The so-called ‘soft’ thematic reportages 
are usually reserved for women. 
 Women’s level of representation in leadership positions is very low in relation to 
men (see Table below).

Women, 18 December 1979. http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/text/econvention.htm . 
140
 Within the context of modernization and democratization of society in general, it is 
necessary that governments bring about the necessary reforms to legal instruments 
for equal chances between men and women with the same qualifications, but also 
the freedom of thought and of opinion, and to ensure visibility and equal access to 
media.
 Women have long since organized into associations and NGOs, not only to defend 
and to uphold their rights as professionals, but also as drivers of development 
within their respective countries. The integration of gender equality in the media 
is a reality in Africa. Women are well represented in media outfits and newsrooms. 
They are usually even more numerous than men.Broadcast

 However, they do not occupy the same place as their male colleagues in the 
newsrooms and in leadership positions. Notwithstanding important progress 
in terms of conditions of service, equal salary treatment and within the work 
environment. 
 The in-service training of professional journalists on the integration of the 
gender dimension in policy is essential to the definition of editorial guidelines. That 
approach would contribute to seriously reduce the stereotypes that are still ever-
present in the practices of the media. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:
• Define policies and processes of the institutionalization of gender equality.
• Guarantee freedom of expression of the media and their protection within the 
framework of institutional instruments.
• Request governments to take into account the gender dimension in sectoral 
policies by adopting legal instruments with the objective of achieving gender 
equality.
• Strengthen the institutional powers of regulatory bodies in regard to gender 
equality.
UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES SHOULD:
• Note that it is 23 years after the Beijing conference, and time to update the declaration.
• Encourage audiovisual media organizations to build capacities of their human 
resources on a gender-equality basis in order to achieve SDGs in 2030.
142
• Systematically disseminate and share reports of gender-relevant surveys with the 
media. 
• Support initiatives to implement gender-equality orientation documents of the au -
diovisual media through financial grants. 
• Elaborate tools for sharing good practice in gender equality in and through the 
media.
• Involve the media at the forefront of the advocacy on the integration of gender 
dimensions in the contents they provide to populations.
MEDIA SHOULD:
• Obtain the support of the authorities (the board, ministries) for gender equality 
progress.
• Encourage media organizations to integrate a gender dimension in their general 
strategy and in their budget activities.
• Monitor effective integration of gender equality in media content.
• Elaborate a strategic orientation document that responds to the implementation 
of legislation on gender equality within the work environment.
• Define guidelines and codes of ethics that integrate a gender dimension in 
audiovisual media.
• Consider capacity building as a key factor for the success of the integration of 
gender equality and encourage all initiatives that contribute to achieve that 
objective.
143
• Participate actively in the advocacy for the importance of a gender dimension in 
the audiovisual media, as mirror of society and gender equality rights.
• Strengthen partnerships with NGOs, regulators and United Nations agencies in 
order to implement the action plans defined in the framework of strategies for 
eradication of stereotypes and sexist images in audiovisual content.
CIVIL SOCIETY SHOULD:
• Create national gender observatories to monitor the effectiveness of integration 
of a gender dimension in policies at a national level.
• Spread good practices in this area.
• Assist the media in their policies of integration and promotion of a gender equality 
dimension.
• Monitor the implementation of laws and regulations applicable in the media sector.
• Put into place a system of evaluation and motivation of the media on the 
implementation of gender equality at all levels of media organizations.
 The media have a central position and a fundamental role in the promotion and 
instigation of new dynamics aimed at achieving gender equality in African societies. 
As the SDG progress report of UN Women testified, though it is well entrenched 
in the political agenda of the states, in reality, equality between men and women 
remains an important gap to bridge.

Case 3. Sustaining Women-Led 
Community Media in the Pacific region; 
the femLINKpacific Experience
Sian Rolls 138
INTRODUCTION 
 The media is a prime conduit for accountability. Given that ‘communication is 
the primary process of any social system or architecture’ (Singh, 2008, p.78), the 
media industry must also keep abreast of shifts within the development paradigm; 
it must enable a discourse for public consumption that is accessible and relevant ‘for 
encouraging the accountability of public authorities by offering spaces for citizens 
to express grievances and make demands on those in positions of power’ (Fantini, 
Gagliardone and Stremlau, 2015).
 With a facilitated two-way discourse, it is expected that decision makers ‘can be held 
accountable for their actions (thus will be) responsive to their stakeholders’ (Ahrens 
and Rudolph, 2006). The stakeholders are the public, including the most vulnerable.
138 Co-Programme Director, femLINKpacific, Fiji. ‘‘Whether it is the women who have taken to the airwaves or the development 
partners who have journeyed with femLINKpacific, they have recognized and 
supported the role of community radio to enable women and young women in all 
their diversities to claim their communication rights in our region. Without a media 
platform of their own women’s rights, peace and human security will remain 
invisible.’ (femLINK, 2016, pp1).
145
especially with regard to the context of a post-disaster situation where community 
media are vital. Yet, living up to this endowed role of the media as the fourth pillar of 
democracy, it not always in the interest of media outlets, including their management. 
 It is within this discourse that models, particularly the People’s Communication 
for Development (PC4D) model, emerged to examine this relationship. PC4D 
emerged as a ‘results oriented communication process(es) based on dialogue and 
participation’ (FAO). This is something critical as ‘communication is the primary 
process of any social system or architecture’ (Singh 2008). PC4D was also a response 
to the leanings of Communication for Development models that ‘became the tool 
for state propaganda… to ‘inculcate and defend the economic, social and political 
agenda of privileged groups that dominate’’ (Herman and Chomsky, in Aslam, 2014).
 It is fundamental within a democratic society to have information that is 
‘shared equitably and managed to the best advantage of all members of society’ 
(Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative in Bhim, 2010). The path to such goals 
requires an empowered, wide-reaching media landscape ‘to offer a platform where 
marginalized people can contest both political and economic power in order to 
enable them to transform specific development systems to their benefit’ (Manyozo 
2016). However, realizing models like PC4D is not without challenges.
 With any organization, there is a need to financially sustain its operations. While 
the media is a vehicle of information dissemination (Dave, 2006), the ownership of 
media outlets through direct investment or through advertising is likely to influence 
the focus of any media coverage. In addition, the design of the media formats – 
such as the length of a news bulletin, the amount of page space or when television 
programmes are aired – are also likely to influence how information is relayed 
(Ashlin & Ladle, 2007). All of these factors play into just how the media plays its role 
as ‘the ‘watchdog of democracy’ in society, guarding the interests of the people, 
fulfilling their socially responsible role’ (Robie, in Aslam, 2014). In the Pacific context, 
this reality is particularly pressing due to the infrastructural limits of both the reach 
of journalists, impacting the collection of information, and broadcast or circulation, 
146
impacting the viability of the media outlet as a commercial entity. This is where 
women-led models of communications and use of technology play a role. 
 The legacy of women’s media networks who negotiated for the broadening of 
the Women and the Media section of the Beijing Platform for Action, to reflect the 
opportunity for women to be recognized as producers of their own media forms, 
resulted in the inclusion of the Strategic Objective in Section J. This recognizes the 
need to increase the participation and access of women to expression and decision-
making in and through the media and new technologies of communication.
 While there have been advances in certain areas of media across the Pacific 
region, large gaps continue to exist in both traditional and digital media outlets 
(Macharia, 2015). Pacific women are challenging the status quo as the producers of 
our own print and electronic media. This is – both in the production of content but 
so too with regards to the political landscape that surrounds the media. For example, 
the Pacific Community notes that “The gender gap in employment rates, as well as the 
fact that women’s political representation in the Pacific Islands region is the lowest of 
any global region, are also important concerns for gender equality”.(SPC, 2015).
 Attention is needed in media environments that have experienced outright 
conflicts. Robie (2011) reported that Fijian journalists do strongly support 
investigative journalism as a measure of commitment to being a watchdog on 
democracy but there is still “the restricted access of information (that has) stopped 
analysis and opinions in all sections of the community” (Bhagwan Rolls, 2011). 
This impacts on gender in media. Lisa Horiwapu, a journalist that leads the Rural 
Women’s Media Network in the Solomon Islands supports this analysis, saying “We 
have lots of women working in the media now, although we still have issues around 
women managing media houses. Apart from that, at the moment, one of our issues 
is trying to make the media cover lots of women’s stories. We are also doing training 
for the mainstream media, especially in trying to encourage them to write women’s 
stories. Not only that but be gender sensitive.”(cited in Sian Rolls, 2017).
147
 Women also operate community radio stations, are media correspondents, 
producers of video documentaries, information providers, communicators and 
media activists. This includes femLINKpacific’s regional media network that started 
with the ‘suitcase’ radio station in 2004.
femLINKpacific 
 femLINKpacific (Media Initiatives for Women) in Fiji launched its ‘suitcase’ radio 
femTALK 89.2 in 2004. A suitcase radio is a mobile radio station comprised of a CD, 
cassette tape players, microphones, controls and the transmitter. Much of the work 
of femTALK 89.2 radio has been to bridge the inter-generational gap – with young 
women learning the technology and older women finding their voice, often after 
years of being told to be silent. 
 Establishing the community radio platform was ‘a bold move because it 
challenged the status quo of existing decision-making structures in Fiji by enabling 
women to speak openly on common matters and, crucially, it also involved young 
women. The suitcase radio has also been used as a training tool to empower women 
to speak to each other and with their communities’ (Bhagwan Rolls & Narayan, 
2008). It enables dialogue about issues that people faced on a day-to-day basis, 
within a context where the political developments in Fiji had resulted in a significant 
impact on the media environment, including the legislative environment. political 
developments in Fiji had resulted
 femLINKpacific’s Generation Next Project supports young women throughout 
the Pacific region to become community radio producers and broadcasters. Initiated 
in Fiji in 2005, the project has since enabled a cadre of more than 100 young women 
to take to the airwaves and use information and communication to bridge the divide 
between urban and rural women, and their communities and national and local 
governance structures (femLINKpacific, 2012). 
 
148
 ‘‘Outside of femLINKpacific, there aren’t as many young women engaged in the 
technical aspect of media production. I know just how critical it is to continue to 
resource women’s media. We need to be setting the agenda, telling our stories and 
creating the narratives. It’s not as simple as just trying to get a woman to talk to 
a camera – it’s about investing effort, time and passion to enable someone who’s 
never been asked her opinion to tell her story.’  – Sian Rolls (Evans, 2017).
 ‘Through listening to women, communicating their stories, reading and 
researching policy documents and policy briefs of women, producing and 
documenting stories with women, for women, peace and security to enhance 
conflict prevention and peacebuilding (I am learning from them as women leaders). 
Another (thing I enjoy) is the radio. Women are able to speak wherever they are, 
from the comfort of their homes, on the mat or the community hall and with the 
availability of ICT their voices are reaching out wide and far across the globe.’  – 
Lucille Chute (Waqa, 2017).
RECOMMENDATIONS 
• Governments must ensure that broadcast policy and regulations support 
women’s media networks, in particular community media and community radio, 
and feminist networks who have a demonstrated role to enable women of all 
diversities, including young women, to use accessible and appropriate media and 
ICTs bridge the gap in media content in particular via the public airwaves.
• Donors and development partners should earmark specific funding towards the 
resourcing of women’s media networks, in particular community media networks 
and feminist media initiatives, which are addressing the persistent societal gender 
inequalities through the use of qualitative and quantitative research including 
media monitoring linked to the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP).
• Donors and development partners should re-define sustainability of women’s 
media networks, in particular community media networks and feminist media 
149
initiatives, by ensuring that at least 30% of all media capacity development funds 
are ear-marked for young women’s development and content creation.
STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD:
• Bring the opinions of women including rural women, women with disabilities as 
well as young women, into the public media arena. 
• Support capacity development of young women community media producers 
to apply their knowledge of gender, media and human rights commitments to 
support their role as community media correspondents, including their ability to 
confidently engage with media and political party structures and leadership.139
• Support the capacity of young women to produce content that responds to the 
gender gaps in media content using the Global Media Monitoring Project to guide 
content production, as well as engagement with public and commercial media 
newsrooms.140

APPENDIX: UNESCO’s contributions 
to Gender Equality in Media
 UNESCO exists as a specialized agency within the UN system, and is the sole 
entity therein with a mandate on media development. In addition, UNESCO’s 
Member States have identified Gender Equality as a cross-cutting priority for the 
work of the organization. In fulfillment of these points, UNESCO persistently works 
in forwarding the promotion and realization of gender equality in media on global, 
regional, national and local levels.
 Below follows a compilation of the most recent efforts undertaken by UNESCO in 
this domain, with relevance to the various themes related in the present publication.
UNESCO AND THE GLOBAL ALLIANCE FOR MEDIA 
AND GENDER (GAMAG)
 GAMAG was an initiative initially spearheaded by UNESCO, and has grown 
to become an independent network. In the process, the two organisations have 
had a number of partnerships. These include technical advice and financial 
support, notably through the International Programme for the Development of 
Communication (IPDC). UNESCO also helped GAMAG draft its Constitution and 
Code of Ethics. 
 UNESCO and GAMAG has also co-hosted several events and activities, such as 
at the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) in NY in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, 
the question of gender equality in and through the media was highlighted in relation 
to the overarching theme of “Women’s economic empowerment in the changing 
world of work”. An event held in UNESCO offices in New York examined the extent to 
which the media-related recommendations on women and the media contained in 
global agreements such as the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action been 
achieved. In 2018, the participants in a packed side-event in the UN General Assembly 
building presented the draft policy papers that constituted the basis of this publication. 
155
 UNESCO and the IPDC have continued supporting GAMAG in promoting gender-
transformative media development. 
UNITWIN NETWORK ON GENDER, MEDIA AND ICTS
 UNESCO has worked closely with the UNITWIN Network, in developing a Global 
Survey on Government Actions. Further, a meeting was held with eight UNITWIN 
members in April 2017 in Barcelona, Spain, which established priorities for the 
network and a plan to grow the network with more member universities. Ten 
universities141 were then members. A further eleven universities142 also strengthened 
regional cooperation during meeting on gender sensitivity in Honduras in June 2017. 
The UNITWIN Network on Gender, Media and ICTs, code of ethics and constitution 
was established and accepted by members. A website has been created.
http://www.unitwin.net/ .
 In the area of research and in connection with capacity building, in 2018, the 
UNESCO UNITWIN Network on Gender, Media and ICTs carried out a mapping 
exercise of related existing educational programmes (educational and training 
activities) in 10 countries (2 in Africa), in 5 world regions. This was done thanks to 
a partnership with the Netherlands via an earmarked grant made by the IPDC. The 
survey resulted in the collation of pedagogical approaches, disciplinary areas, gaps 
in educational offers, existing good practices, and future challenges. As a result, 
a new model curriculum has been drafted, called “ Gender, Media and ICTs: New 
syllabi for media, communication and journalism ” as part of UNESCO’s series on 
141 RMIT in Melbourne, Australia, the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the University of 
Padova, Italy, Howard University in the USA, S.N.D.T. Women’s University, Autonomous University of 
Barcelona, Hawassa University, Ethiopia, Complutense University Spain, UNIBE Dominican Republic, 
and the Namibia University of Science and Technology.

journalism education. This was previewed at the annual congress of the International 
Association for Media and Communications Research in 2018. 
THE GLOBAL REPORT ON THE STATUS 
OF WOMEN IN THE NEWS MEDIA (2011)
 Together with International Women’s Media Foundation (IWMF) UNESCO helped 
pioneer the most ambitious undertaking to date in promoting women’s voices in 
news media. Through a global and international research partnership, this resulted 
in a groundbreaking report published in 2011. The report offered comprehensive 
data on the status of women in news production as well as in decision-making and 
ownership structures within media management. It targeted professional facets 
such as governance, publishing, editing, reporting, photojournalism, broadcasting 
etc. Executives at more than 500 companies in 59 countries were interviewed by 
more than 150 researchers. The final report revealed gender-specific glass ceilings 
in 20 out of 59 countries, especially for middle and senior management positions. 
Just above half of the included companies had gender equity policies. By region, 
Western and Sub-Saharan Africa companies came in at 69% having such policies. 
For companies in Eastern Europe, 16% had these policies. 
THE GLOBAL MEDIA MONITORING REPORT (2015-)
 The Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP) saw its inception at the Women 
Empowering Communication international conference in Bangkok, 1994. The World 
Association for Christian Communication (WACC) and MediaWatch headed this 
global effort to enhance gender equality in news media. The project has several 
objectives with international scope: to map representation and portrayal of women 
in mainstream news media; to develop grassroots research; to strengthen networks 
among gender and communication groups; to create awareness and to develop 
monitoring skills in the media. The report is published every 5th year and is based on 
data collected by volunteer researchers. UNESCO was a partner in the latest report from 2015, which covered over 100 countries and focused on media performance 
particularly as regards coverage of women worldwide. Results showed stagnating 
progress since 2010, and identified glass ceilings for women reporters in especially 
visual media. While news content concerning dimensions of gender equality has 
faintly improved, it remain at a poor 9% of all content. Even less content was found 
to challenge gender stereotypes. Thus the research revealed entrenched patterns 
and norms detrimental to the representation of women in mainstream news media 
and on all platforms. This pattern also concerns women’s participation in top levels 
of management. 
WOMEN MAKE THE NEWS CAMPAIGNS
 Women Make the News (WMN) is a global campaign timed to kick off on 8 March, 
International Women’s Day. In 2017, the UNESCO-led initiative used key results from 
the 2015 Global Media Monitoring Project to highlight gender inequality by creating 
social media posts and focusing the campaign the Gender Equality Check. This in 
turn is based on the UNESCO developed Gender Sensitive Indicators for Media  
(GSIM). Sixty-two partners, including 18 media organizations took part.143 
 In 2018, the Women Make the News campaign was titled “Gender Equality 
and Sports Media” ( https://en.unesco.org/womenmakenews ), during which three 
initiatives were launched to forward the conversation on gender inequality and 
stereotypical portrayals of female athletes within sports coverage. These included:
• A Google Chrome extension labelled “HerHeadline”, the first–ever gender equality 
plugin which enabled an automatic highlighting of gender unequal sports coverage, 
including qualitative and quantitative gaps in media coverage of women athletes.144 
143 Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Benin, Canada, China, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Fiji, 
Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan. Kazakhstan, Liberia, Mauritania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Viet Nam and Zambia.
158
• Under the hashtag #HerMomentsMatter, UNESCO revisited sexist headlines with 
regard to female athletes published by news outlets during the previous Olympic 
Games. This social media campaign was a follow up to the theme of World Radio 
Day 2018 (see below) in relation to which several videos and audio clips were also 
produced regarding the topic. 
• An interactive quiz “Guess who” was designed to reveal unequal coverage of 
women’s sports. 
GENDER SENSITIVE INDICATORS FOR THE MEDIA (GSIM) 
AND GENDER AWARE POLICYMAKING
 Since the launch of the groundbreaking GSIM in 2012, and following their 
translation into six language, more than 50 media institutions/organizations and 16 
educational institutions and/or universities have been implementing policies and 
strategies based on application of the GSIM. 
 These include 15 in South East Asia145, 11 in South Asia146, 15 universities in 
Central Asia147, 6 institutions in the LAC region148 and 17 institutions in the Middle 
144 This extension is now to be reviewed.
145 The Alliance of Independent Journalists of Indonesia in Indonesia, the Radio Republik Indonesia 
in Indonesia and the Philippines Social Science Council in South Asia in the Philippines. In Thailand, 
UNESCO supported 12 media houses to develop and implement a gender mainstreaming strategy 
based on UNESCO’s GSIM. In addition, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, UNESCO in collaboration with 
the Asia Pacific Institute for Broadcasting Development (AIBD) organized a regional gender sensitive 
reporting workshop in March 2019, where participating editors and journalists from Nepal, Singapore, 
Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Maldives, Laos, Bhutan, as well as Malaysia, learnt about implicit gender bias in 
the media and its influence in newsrooms and programming.
146 South Asia Women’s Network (SWAN), Indian Institute of Mass Communication in India, Institute for 
Studies in Industrial Development in India, Development and Humanitarian Services for Afghanistan 
(DHSA) in Afghanistan, Manusher Jonno Foundation in Bangladesh, Dhensel Research and Consulting 
in Bhutan, Addu Women’s Association in the Maldives, Mizzima in Myanmar, Initiatives of Media 
Women in Nepal, Uks in Pakistan, and Women and Media Collective in Sri Lanka
147 In Kazakhstan, the Suleiman Demirel University and KazNU have implemented the GSIM in their 
research and presentations, while 13 other universities are currently using the GSIM.
148 The School of Communication of the University of Matanzas in Cuba, along with Radio Libertad, 
Radio Chaparra, Radio Manatí, Radio Cabaniguán and Radio Maboas in Cuba, are following an 
assessment implemented by the Cuban Union of Journalists, with support from IPDC in 2016.
159
East149. In Africa, the GSIM have been implemented to conduct self-assessment 
studies by the Malawi Institute of Journalism (MIJ) in Malawi, and in Zimbabwe by 
the Harare Polytechnic’s School of Journalism and Media Studies and by 4 radio 
stations in Rwanda.150
 Coherent with UNESCO’s strategy to empower women and girls through policy 
implementation, more than 30 institutions, community radio stations and national 
broadcasters around the world have adopted policies and/or developed strategical 
frameworks on youth or gender equality in media.
 In this vein, in Rwanda, UNESCO’s efforts helped to lead to almost 30 media 
houses signing an agreement with the AWMP (Association of Women in Media 
Platform) to develop and implement gender sensitive guidelines. Contributing to 
the implementation of the Rwanda Strategy for Gender Mainstreaming in Media, 
key recommendations were realized: the creation of a media platform to inform and 
educate against Gender Based Violence, and a gender audit assessing whether the 
30% minimum representation provided for by the Constitution is being respected.
 In Morocco, a memorandum was signed between UNESCO, UN Women and the 
constitutional regulatory body for communication called HACA (High Authority of 
Audiovisual Communication). A joint initiative was launched to develop an in-house 
monitoring tool designed to raise awareness among media operators on the image 
of women in the media landscape. The tool was based on UNESCO’s GSIM and the 
Global Media Monitoring Project indicators, and its success engendered requests 
from other countries (Niger and Belgium). 
149 16 different media institutions (print, audio-visual and online) were sensitized on gender sensitive 
matters within the workforce based on UNESCO’s GSIM in Lebanon; in Jordan, with support from 
IPDC, the organization 7iber conducted a monitoring study on diversity and gender representation 
in Jordanian media content based on the GSIM. Findings were disseminated online through various 
channels to all media outlets and have been used as a reference guide for media professionals.
150 Radio Izuba FM, Radio Huguka FM, Radio Ishingiro FM, and Radio Isangano FM in Rwanda.
160
 As the results of its application in Morocco showed mis- and underrepresentation 
of women in media content, UNESCO later piloted a gender focused programme with 
the national broadcaster SNRT (Société nationale de radiodiffusion de television), 
supporting their creation of a parity committee that consequently prepared a 
Charter and an Action Plan based on UNESCO’s GSIM. Furthermore, two online data 
bases aiming at enhancing women experts participation in news programming were 
launched (KHABIRAT and expertes.ma). UNESCO has supported the creation of a 
special gender sensitive ‘training of trainers’ for SNRT operators (journalists and 
content producers, managers, broadcasters and regulators). 
 In Tunisia, UNESCO supported the elaboration of a multi-stakeholder Media and 
Gender Charter, by the independent national regulatory authority for audio-visual 
communication (HAICA) and the National Journalists’ Union (SNJT). The Charter, 
based on the GSIM, aims at promoting equal representation of women in the media 
and fighting stereotypes.
GENDER EQUALITY IN JOURNALISM EDUCATION 
AND TRAININGS FOR MEDIA PROFESSIONALS 
 Between 2014-2018, UNESCO also implemented the project “Support to Media 
in Jordan” funded by the European Union. A series of workshops on professional 
reporting on issues related to human rights and gender issues resulted in the 
production of radio reports on gender issues and women’s rights.
 Following a regional training workshop in Jordan on UNESCO’s Gender Sensitive 
Indicators for Media for Arab States Public Broadcasters late 2017, and discussions 
with Lebanese partners on Gender in Media, UNESCO initiated a project on “Balanced 
Media in Policies and Language” addressing a pressing need within the Lebanese 
context. The training was based on the GSIM, and aimed to engage decision makers 
in Lebanese media to influence HR managers to adopt modifications to internal 
policies and procedures based on the GSIM; and to build the capacity of middle 
161
management of media in Lebanon to reflect gender sensitive balanced language in 
media production. 
 The UNESCO Office in Rabat, Morocco reported that work with the Women 
Journalists Network in Mauritania led to strengthened capacities and facilitation 
of the internal structuring and expansion of the network, adding a mentoring 
component to help young female professionals. It also led to the designation of the 
first female Editor in Chief of the main national channel.
 UNESCO gave technical support to implementing organizations of IPDC-
supported projects, promoting gender awareness in journalism education and/
or focusing on capacity building for women journalists. In Jordan, the project 
“Fostering gender equality within media organizations in Jordan” allowed 7iber to 
conduct an assessment study of diversity and gender representation in Jordanian 
media content based on UNESCO’s GSIM. Recommendations were developed and 
propagated in Jordanian media organizations.
 In Cuba, the Cuban Union of Journalists (CUJ) invited 30 female journalists 
from Cuba, Colombia and Argentina for a capacity-building activity focusing on 
management of media institutions entitled “Women lead the media: Developing 
managerial and leadership skills in women journalists from LAC”.
 In Kazakhstan, the bilingual project “Strengthening Curriculum on Gender 
Journalism” for journalism educators from 15 universities151 in Kazakhstan looked 
at gender inequalities, stereotypes and discrimination in the media content, and 
151 Pavlodar State University named after S. Toraigyrov, Karaganda State University named after E. 
Buketova, Atyrau State University named after H. Dosmukhamedova, Eurasian National University 
named after L. Gumilyov (Astana), Taraz State University named after H. Dulati, International University 
of Turkestan named after A. Yassavi, Al-Farabi Kazakh National University (Almaty), University of Korkyt-
Ata (Kyzyl-Orda), Turan University (Almaty), State University Shakarim (Semipalatinsk), KIMEP University, 
(Almaty), Zhetysu State University named after I. Zhansugurova (Taldykorgan), Kazakh University of 
International Relations and World Languages named after Abylai Khan (Almaty), and University of 
Suleiman Demirel (Almaty).
162
led to specific classes and modules on gender journalism and mainstreaming of 
gender aspects in the curriculum. The training was bilingual in Russian/Kazakh, 
and sessions included UNESCO’s GSIM and Gender Journalism’s Russian/Kazakh 
translation as well as exchange of best practices among the universities. 
 In the Dominican Republic in September 2018, 70 male and female supervisors 
from the network of Radio Stations of the Community Technology Centres 
participated in the capacity building workshop “Promotion of the gender approach 
on and through the radio”. Technical support from UNESCO included the webinar 
“Gender Approach and the Media” with the participation of over 1,000 connected 
users.
 In 2018, a project on the training of members of community radios and 
Community Multimedia Centres (CMCs) in Senegal in conflict-sensitive reporting 
gave special attention to reporting violence against women and to gender equality. 
It included the exchange of good practice from community radio stations in other 
countries such as Congo, Mali, and Rwanda. 
WORLD RADIO DAY (WRD)
 In 2018, stakeholders around the world celebrated World Radio Day (13 
February) under the theme “Radio and Sports” with a focus on gender equality in 
sports and deconstructing gender stereotypes through sports reporting. 490 events 
were organized in 102 countries. Young people in Jordan, Morocco, Palestine and 
Tunisia organized related campaigns through the EU-funded NET-MED Youth project 
by doing programmes, trainings, discussions and other activities that challenged 
gender stereotypes and promoted gender equality through sports coverage.
 Also marking WRD 2018, UNESCO partnered with the International Association 
of Women in Radio and Television (IAWRT) to organize India’s first ever Radio 
Festival, with at least 40% women in the audience, and with the participation of 
163
leading Indian women athletes, national awardees, and women officials heading 
India’s public service broadcaster and sports authority. Subsequent sessions at the 
event included at least 40% women. Specific presentations by community radio 
professionals focused on how radio has helped empower women and promote 
gender equality at the community level.
OTHER PROJECTS IN BROADCASTING 
AND VISUAL MEDIA
 Gender equality and women’s empowerment was a key aspect to a SIDA-funded 
project implemented by UNESCO, titled “Promoting Freedom of Expression, media 
development, and access to information and knowledge”152 and which included 
UNESCO’s “Empowering Local Radio with ICTs” project (2015 – 2018). This built the 
capacities of 27 local radio stations, located in 6 African countries, by strengthening 
long-term skills of local radio journalists, technicians, volunteers, correspondents 
and station managers. Emphasis was on the integration of ICTs allowed to modernize 
the radio stations’ operations, including programming and programme content; 
interviewing, researching, reporting and conducting investigations; broadcasting; 
guest interventions and other public interaction. 
 Throughout, the project encouraged the participation of female presenters 
and journalists/correspondents in training workshops – gender parity was always a 
target since constituting the most efficient way to ensure women’s representation 
of in radio stations’ staff. The project improved the quality of programmes and the 
interaction with listeners – poor people in rural areas – and extended the geographical 
coverage of news through the creation of networks of local correspondents from 
152 This SIDA-funded multiyear project had a clear gender component and connects to various 
activities reported in this document, such as the WMN campaign, the toolkit to train judiciary 
members in Africa, work with broadcasters and regulatory authorities in Morocco (HACA) and Tunisia 
(HAICA) etc. The SIDA-funded project also created synergies with other sectors and projects of 
UNESCO where gender equality is an explicit focus or embedded component. 
164
among communities’ members. Specific outcomes were designed to achieve 
quantifiable goals regarding gender balance and gender equality in the stations 
themselves, as well as in broadcasting. The implementation of ICTs made it easier 
for women to intervene in the debate by utilizing text messages (SMS), calls and 
posting on social media. Some programmes were dedicated to gender-specific 
concerns such as women’s rights, teen pregnancy, female genital mutilation, gender 
violence, sexual violence, etc. Other programmes were utilized as platforms for 
women’s expressions, with the promotion of local female artists and talents.
 The photo exhibition “On Air with Rural Women”, demonstrating the gender 
transformative impact of the project, has been presented at several venues, 
including UNESCO Headquarters on International Women’s Day 2018. It was further 
chosen by the European Commission to be displayed at the European Development 
Days in Brussels on 3-4 June 2018, and was presented at the 2019 Commission 
on the status of Women in New York City in March. The exhibition gathered audio 
testimonies of women journalists involved in community radio stations.153 From 
May to mid-July 2018, another photo exhibition of the “Empowering Local Radio 
with ICTs” project was featured on the fence lines of UNESCO HQ and was also made 
available online. The exhibition demonstrated the gender transformative impact of 
the project. 
 Both exhibitions combined creative audio and/or visual installations to display 
how the inclusion of rural women – one of the most marginalized groups in the 
world – in local radio can contribute to progress on gender issues in some of the 
hardest-to-reach communities of Africa.
 UNESCO participated in the Arab States Broadcasting Union (ASBU) festival in 
Tunis in April 2018. On that occasion, several meetings were held, including several 
153 More information on the exhibition can be found at: https://en.unesco.org/onairwithruralwomen.
165
exchanges around the pilot experiences on gender. This led to the realization that 
there is a need of a regional conference to further a unified gender approach in the 
broadcasting industry. 
 It was also the occasion to create synergies with the UNESCO-led project “Enhancing 
a gender responsive film sector in the Maghreb-Mashreq region”. This SIDA and EU 
supported project was implemented by UNESCO in partnership with UN Women, 
Mena Media Monitoring and the International Women’s Film Festival of Salé. It had 
the overall objective to enhance the image of women in the film sector in seven target 
countries: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. It directly 
benefits female film professionals by creating an enabling environment to formulate 
and express their concerns, and promotes freedom of expression by encouraging 
regional film makers to address gender inequality and tackle gender stereotypes.
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) AND THE MEDIA
 UNESCO observed the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against 
Women in New Delhi, India, by organizing the event ‘Media reporting of sexual 
violence: Why, what and how much?’ on 26 November 2018. The initiative was 
part of a larger ongoing UNESCO – Bournemouth University project titled Media 
Action Against Rape (MAAR). The event in brought together over 100 leading 
women journalists, editors and media stakeholders. The core objective was to 
promote gender-sensitive reporting of GBV and promote gender equality at media 
organizations.
 The project “Preventing Violence and Promoting Gender Equality through media 
in Morocco and Senegal”, supported by Spain, saw the launch of “Mig Radio” in 
December 2018 Marrakech as part of the United Nation’s High-Level Conference 
to formally adopt the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. The 
temporary radio station was operated by young community journalists from the 
southern Mediterranean region and sub-Saharan Africa. A workshop was held in 
to August 2018 in Thiès, Senegal where 40 media professionals were trained on 
166
the concepts of human rights, gender and the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and ethical journalism. The 
participants produced radio programmes that be disseminated to local communities 
for rebroadcasting.
GENDER, MEDIA AND ICTS
 In Cuba, the project “Promoting gender equality through ICTs” in September and 
October of 2017 allowed 35 men and women from the ICT sector in Cuba sensitized 
to develop information products and mobile apps to promote women and girls 
empowerment through ICTs in the framework a workshop organized in partnership 
with the Cuban Union of Informatics Professionals (UIC). Awareness raised on the 
integration of Gender Equality perspectives into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development. 
SAFETY OF WOMEN JOURNALISTS 
AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION
 In 2018, a range of institutions, as well as women and men, improved their capacity 
in the areas of freedom of expression and diversity. In Africa, UNESCO launched the 
first ever African MOOC on freedom of expression and the safety of journalists. More 
than 900 people from 42 African countries participated, of which 40% were women 
belonging to the judiciary and civil society. Participants included high-ranking judges 
such as Justice Lillian Tibatemwa Ekirikubinza from the Supreme Court of Uganda . 
 Since 2018, and by decision of its Executive Board, UNESCO includes gender 
issues in its annual inquiries to Member States on the status of judicial follow-up 
of killings of journalists. This takes the form of a request to include information on 
“actions taken to monitor and tackle gender-specific risks as a way to share good 
practices”. This is a measure to inspire Member States to undertake such actions 
and allows for sharing of good practices between Member States.
167
 UNESCO has included specialized sections on safety of women journalists in 
its annual reports such as the report on “World Trends in Freedom of Expression 
and Media Development” (published in the second half of 2017) and the UNESCO 
Director-General’s Report on the Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity 
(published in November 2018). These reports mainstream gender equality 
considerations throughout their content. 
 Further support in the area of safety includes UNESCO helping to ensure the 
publication of a handbook by the International Association of Women in Radio and 
Television (IAWRT) in 2017 titled “What if…Safety Handbook for Women journalists” 
featuring practical advice for women journalists.
 To increase its efforts in raising awareness on the specific risks and threats faced 
by women journalists worldwide, UNESCO has collected personal testimonies by 
women journalists for a publication on threats and harassment against women 
journalists. This publication will be launched in 2019 and this will kick-off a larger 
project on the safety of women journalists, to be rolled out subsequently.
 In February 2018, the UNESCO Office in Mexico participated in the discussion 
panel “national and international challenges to eradicate violence against women 
journalists” organized by the National Women Institute (Inmujeres) and the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs. The Office also discussed media development and the role of 
IPDC and UNESCO’s MDI and GSIM, emphasizing capacity building and protection of 
women journalists. 
 Alongside the Commission on the Status of Women at the General Assembly, 
UNESCO held a panel on Safety of Women Journalists on 22 March 2018 with 5 
participants, including Alison Smale, UN Under-Secretary-General for Global 
Communications. UNESCO participated in a panel on online harassment of women 
journalists in London on 8 November 2018 at the 23rd Congress of the Worldwide 
Association of Women Journalists and Writers.
168
 From May to mid-July 2018, a regional training course for women journalists 
on election reporting took place in Islamabad, Pakistan. Reflecting the challenges 
of the reporting industry, the 70 women journalists comprised 20% of the total 
beneficiaries, although they were given priority in the selection of participants. 
Gender sensitive reporting was a crosscutting theme across all modules. Gender 
emerged as the fourth most recurring theme taken up by the trainees on issues of 
gender bias, profiling of women political candidates, misogynistic slander campaigns 
as well as issues of transgender persons etc. Eminent transgender activists had 
been invited to observe and give feedback on the gender responsiveness module.
 In November 2018, UNESCO, together with OHCHR, the Netherlands and IREX, co-
organized a regional conference in Central America on the Digital Safety of Women 
Journalists. The conference which was hosted by the government of El Salvador, 
generated recommendations for a regional Plan of Action on psychological support 
for women journalists. During the conference, the UNESCO Office in San José 
launched the Central American Council on the Safety of Journalists, a platform to 
promote cooperation and dialogue among key stakeholders including governments, 
associations of journalists and other members of civil society.
WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY (WPFD)
 At the global celebration of World Press Freedom Day (WPFD) on 2-3 May in 
Accra, UNESCO hosted a discussion organized by the International Women’s Media 
Foundation (IWMF) on sexual and gender-based harassment in the media industry. 
Women journalists from different countries shared their experience and discussed 
possible mechanisms to address harassment. The “Academic Conference on the 
Safety of Journalists”, organized by UNESCO as a component of WPFD, featured a 
panel on “Sexuality, Religion and Other Sensitive Issues”. During this, recent research 
on safety of journalists and gender issues was presented.
 UNESCO’s observance of WPFD 2018 (3 May) in India was conducted keeping the 
principles of gender equality firmly in mind. At least 40% of the 120 or so participants 
169
in the event were women, with the presence of senior women journalists and editors. 
The annual South Asia Press Freedom Report for 2017-18 (produced by IFJ and 
supported by UNESCO), launched on the occasion, contained a special chapter on 
trends relating to gender in the media across South Asia, advocating gender equality 
at media organizations, and analysing the #MeToo movement in the sub-region.
IPDC
 During the 31st Council Session of the Intergovernmental Programme for the 
Development of Communication (IPDC), Member States adopted a Decision on the 
safety of journalists. The Decision encourages Member States to continue to employ 
a gender-sensitive lens in their reporting for the Director General’s Report on the 
Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity and to report on “action[s] taken 
to monitor and tackle gender specific risks”. Additionally, it invites Member States to 
reinforce reporting by “continuing to strengthen a gender-sensitive analysis in order 
to highlight the specific risks faced by women journalists in the exercise of their work”. 
 Between 2017 and 2019, UNESCO supported several activities with an explicit 
focus on gender equality. These activities included awareness raising and capacity 
building as well as journalism education and trainings for media professionals. They 
also included trainings on gender aware strategy and policy formulation for media 
organizations and associations. Such projects were carried out in Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
Botswana, Cuba, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Malawi, the Maldives Mauritius, 
Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe and 
(including participants from Cuba, Argentina and Colombia). At least six of the projects 
utilized UNESCO’s Gender Sensitive Indicator’s for Media (GSIM) and some were also 
implemented with technical support from respective UNESCO Field Offices.
PUBLICATIONS
 In addition, UNESCO developed and disseminated a number of tools/resources 
with bearing on gender equality to ensure more sustainable approaches to capacity 
170
building in its respective areas of competence. These include:
The publication “UNESCO’s Internet Universality Indicators - A framework for Assessing 
Internet Development” , published in 2019. This has gender issues mainstreamed in 
each section, and also given particular attention in a section on cross-cutting indicators. 
It is available on French, English and Spanish. It is being translated to Russian, Chinese, 
Arabic and Portuguese: https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality
A “Toolkit for the Judiciary in Africa on Freedom of Expression Standards”  has been 
published. It includes a specific module that focuses on the “Gendered perspective 
to freedom of expression” in Africa. A key objective of this module is to identify 
the particular challenges faced by women in exercising this right of freedom of 
expression. https://en.unesco.org/news/unesco-launches-toolkit-judiciary-africa-
freedom-expresssion  
The “Survey on Privacy in Media and Information Literacy with Youth Perspectives” , 
published in November 2017, including a gender equality perspective in the framing 
of MIL as a defence for privacy within the development context. 
“Gender Portrayal in the Jordanian Media Content” - Read the full study EN, AR
The new curriculum on Gender, Media and ICTs is cited above under the UNITWIN section. 
WORKING GROUPS IN THE BROADBAND 
COMMISSION (2010-)
 The Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development was launched 
by UNESCO and ITU in 2010, and it emphasises the importance of broadband in 
international policy development and to achieve the Sustainable Development 
Goals. To this end, it gathers high-level leaders across relevant fields and sectors 
to foster cooperation regarding ICTs and broadband-based technologies for 
sustainable development. UNESCO is co-vice chair of the Commission, and has 
171
co-chaired various Working Groups (WG), including on the Digital Gender Divide 
in 2016-2017, which produced a report including policy recommendations titled 
“Bridging the gender gap in internet and broadband access and use”. The other 
working group with explicit focus on gender was the WG on Broadband and Gender, 
2012-2015 where UNESCO was included among commissioners.
 UNESCO continuously strives to integrate a gender perspective in the active 
Working Groups, including by emphasizing SDG 5 for Gender Equality. The three 
current groups focus on Child Safety On-line, Digital Infrastructure in Africa, and the 
recently established Freedom of Expression and Tackling Disinformation. The latter 
was formed on the initiative of UNESCO, which co-chairs the group, and furthermore 
specifically included SDG 5 in its terms of reference. 
THE EQUALS SKILLS COALITION
 UNESCO co-leads with the Government of Germany, the Skills Coalition of the 
EQUALS partnership. The Coalition gathers around 40 partners from government, 
NGOs and INGOs, and the private sector. The Skills Coalition, among other activities, 
develops guidance and tools to reverse the digital skills gender gap.
 Within this framework, the Gender Equality Division at UNESCO heads a project 
for developing digital skills for girls and women. It aims to reduce digital inequality 
between women and men by developing knowledge products advancing gender-
transformative skills training, and thereby ultimately empower women and girls to 
fully participate in the digital world. In May 2019, UNESCO co-published the report 
“I’d Blush if I could: Closing gender divides in digital skills through education”  together 
with the EQUALS Skills Coalition with support from Gemany. The report exposes 
the proliferation and cementation of gender biases in ICTs, particularly in digital 
assistants like Siri and Alexa. It further addresses the issue of widening gender gaps 
in digital skills. The publication also explores the importance of gender-responsive 
education to promote gender equality in technology sectors. Recommendations focus 
on strengthening digital skills among women and girls, improving gender equality in 
172
digital professions, and eliminating stereotypes in AI applications. The report received 
extensive international attention, testifying to its relevance and urgency. 
ONGOING PROJECTS:
 Through partnerships with experts, UNESCO has prepared a publication on the media 
coverage of gender-specific issues such as “honour” killing, teenage pregnancy, child 
marriage, paternity, gender-free identities etc. This publication will be a practical manual 
to serve as editorial guidelines to provide assistance to media by outlining ways in which 
broadcasters and journalists in general should improve coverage of these issues. The 
launch of this publication is planned for 2019. It is foreseen that this publication will be 
translated into training modules for journalism schools or journalists in the newsrooms.
 Also foreseen is a Handbook on gender equality in the media intended for 
journalists and media professionals, related to improving the gender-sensitivity of 
sports broadcasts and tackling the impact of gender roles within sports media.  
 UNESCO is also currently working on a Handbook that aims to explore how 
the propagation of “narrow” masculinity in the media can potentially be linked to 
the exclusion of other masculine identities, as well as to violence against women, 
children and other men. 
The project “Promoting the Safety of Women Journalists” foresees two publications:
“#Journaliststoo – Women Journalists Speak Out”: collection of essays by 12 women 
journalists from all over the world featuring their personal experiences with 
harassment.
• An academic study that will identify effective mechanisms to counter harassment 
of women journalists.
 Another upcoming UNESCO publication is titled “Towards contemporary policy 
and practice for gender equality in and through the media and ICT”.
173
 The position papers in this publication respond to the need for 
contemporary policy on gender and media. They provide the reader a basis 
to interrogate existing norms of inequality and to reinforce mechanisms 
to strengthen gender equality within the media landscape. The papers, 
written by members of the Global Alliance for Media and Gender, assess 
contemporary issues often such as the persistent gaps in gender equality 
in and through the media. They explore how these hinder work towards 
the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. The chapters 
include author's policy options for how to achieve advances at the interface 
of gender and information.

 Preface  
 
This paper was prepared as a background paper  for the World Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) 
initiative , in which  digital skills is one of the five foundational pillars , and which was launched  in January 
2019.  Presenting a digital skills framework  was considered the first step in preparing the digital skills pillar 
of the: (a) DE4A Country Diagnostic Tool , to be used by the World Bank’s country teams to present  
strategies to foster and leverage digital skills for the emerging digital economy, and (b) DE4A Score card, 
which is being used by the World Bank to monitor progress towards achieving the DE4A targets for the 
African continent  to be achieved before 2030 . These targets are aligned with the strategic orientations of 
the World Bank Group as well as the global development agenda (i.e., SDG 4).  
 
Earlier working drafts of this paper have informed ongoing work of the World Bank on digital skills and 
have been revi sed as this work evolved. An early draft formed part of the technical background work for 
the 5th Forum of the Partnership for skills in Applied Sciences, Engineering and Technology (PASET), 
which is facilitated by the World Bank. The Forum (“Destination D igital Africa: Preparing our Youth for 
the Future) was held in May 2019 in Kigali and attended by 21 African countries and many partner 
countries.  Subsequent revisions of the draft (July 2019 and November 2019) were used as World Bank ’s 
inputs for the  African Union ’s Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa . The paper and the proposed 
digital skills framework s were also used to revise the  Digital Skills pillar of the DE4A Country Diagnostic 
Tool , to prepare the DE4A Scorecard  and for the Digital Skills Country Action Plan Technical Assistance 
provided to PASET countries.  The Digital Skills pillar of the DE4A Country Diagnostic Tool and 
Scorecard,  which incorporate the digital skills framework  outlined in the paper , were revie wed and

 Summary  
 
This paper presents a framework for digital skills, based on a review of international frameworks . It 
discusses the demand  and supply  of digital skills as well as  a mapping with formal education programs  at 
different levels of the system  that could produce these skills . It also gives examples of programs outside of 
formal education programs that could be used for imparting skills training. Finally, it suggests indicators  
(Annex 1)  that could be used to be tter measure progress towards the objectives of the DE4A initiative. The 
paper does not cover the question of connecting schools and universities to broadband, the types of 
technologies that could be used in education or the issues that need to be addresse d in implementing the 
use of technology – these are covered in other background papers . 
 
The paper highlights the following issues : 
 
(i) Digital skills for citizens and non - ICT professions : One of the most comprehensive 
framework s of digital skills for citize ns is the E uropean Union  (EU) ’s DigComp 2.1 Digital 
Skills Competence Framework  and/or its adap tation by UNESCO UIS  in the  Digital Literacy 
Global Framework (DLGF) . The DigComp framework  has 5 competence  areas , while the 
DLGF  framework has seven competence areas to better address  developing country contexts. 
Both have four proficiency levels – basic, intermediate, advanced and highly specialized , which 
can be further broken down into 8 levels depending on the level of task com plexity . The 
framework is especially useful for defining basic and intermediate skills that need to be broadly 
acquired by the youth population.  Adapt ation of t his framework to the local contexts  of 
countries is required , in order to develop relevant educa tion courses, training programs, and 
assessment frameworks.  Countries will need assistance to do this.  
 
(ii) Digital skills for the ICT professions require a separate framework that describes the highly 
technical content and composition of skills applied in the  ICT workplace.  The EU’s e -
Competence Framework 3.0 provides a useful reference which includes 5 competence areas 
and 5 proficiency levels  associated with  40 competencies required and applied in the ICT 
professions.  
 
 
(iii) While t he demand for digital skills is difficult to assess, especially in the informal sector, the 
requirement for basic digital  skills is likely to become ubiquitous . This is also the case  for 
intermediate level skills in most  formal sector  jobs. New approaches to assessing labor market 
demand, including data from online job search platforms  and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based 
analysis , can help to identify the skills that are in demand  at levels above the basic level . 
 
(iv) While  the supply of digital skills is equally  challenging to assess, self-reported measures 
suggest a large proportion of th ose living  in some of the Africa n countries do not even possess 
the most basic digital skills, which reflects their lack of familiarity with using a broad set of 
digital devices and services.  
 
(v) For non -ICT professions and citizens more broadly, digital skills can be developed though 
formal learning in educational institutions, a s well as informal and nonformal learning 
programs : 
a. Basic digital skills  should be provided to all high school students . While t he content of 
many of these courses is readily available,  there is important work to be done to adapt these 
to local contexts and to use local content.  Further, implementation challenges of delivering 
at scale have to be addressed . In North Africa, where primary schools are better equipped, 
basic digital skills can be provided at this level as well.    Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
6 
 b. Basic and , in some cases,  intermediate digital skills  should  also be provided out side of 
school  settings , especially as the majority of young people in regions such as Africa are 
out of school. The se skills  would ne ed to be provided together with foundational literacy 
and numeracy programs. While a  variety of  learning content s associated with basic and 
intermediate digital skills  are already available, public -private partnerships would need to 
be explored for efficie nt delivery to this population.  
c. Intermediate  digital  skills  should be provided to  students in  upper secondary  schools  and 
to all students in technical -vocational and undergraduate non-ICT programs , as these 
students will enter occupations that require increasing use of technology .  At the technical -
vocational and undergraduate level, students in non -ICT courses that are more technology 
intensive can also to be taught advanced digital literacy skills . 
d. In order to develop intermediate, advanced and specialized skills for the ICT professions, 
TVET and higher education institutions need to develop and reform courses that are 
benchmarked to international frameworks. At  the TVET level, these include hardware and 
software relate d courses for IT technicians, while at the university level, they include the 
core engineering programs  such as  electrical and computer engineering /science  programs. 
At present,  both TVET and university courses in these disciplines are too theoretical and 
outdated. Considerable and sustained efforts to reform these program s are  essential for 
African countries to assimilate and diffuse digital technologies . Bootcamps and rapid 
skilling/coding courses can also help to produce advanced digital skills, especially when 
there are spikes in demand for particular skills/programming languages. These can be 
delivered  through  universities in partnership with companies , or by the latter on their own.   
Highly specialized  digital skills  will be imparted through  postgraduate programs in applied 
mathematics, computer engineering courses  of high quality to train faculty and to introduce 
new courses. These may have to be done  at the regional level  due to the shortages of highly 
skilled instructors who could handle such technical courses.

 1. The Importance of Digital Skills in Driving Digital Transformation  
 
Digital skills constitute  one of the five foundational pillars of the Digital Economy for Africa initiative, 
launched by the World Bank, and are needed to mobilize digital innovations to transform economies, 
societies and governments in Africa.  The other foundational pillars are d igital infrastructure, digital 
platforms, digital financial services and digital entrepreneurship. African economies require both a digitally 
competent workforce  as well as digitally literate citizens  who could reap the benefits that the digital society 
brings.  
A digitally competent workforce can help strengthen the foundational pillars: the installation of the 
digital infrastructure  (for example, connectivity and data repositories ) that is most relevant for Africa, the 
growth of digital entrepreneurship  (for example, incubators and e -commerce, that shapes digital industries, 
and the development and use of digital platforms  and digital financial services  (for example, e -signatures 
and digital payments) . Moreover, a digitally competent workforce , comprising a  large majority with basic 
digital skills and a critical mass of skilled personnel and advanced specialists,  can help to extend the 
application of digital tools and processes in a wide variety of sectors, such as the informal service sector, 
agriculture, e nergy, transportation, health and education, to name a few.  
Digitally literate citizens can better reap the benefits of the digital economy by gaining access to more, 
better and safer information ranging from e -government services, commercial products and news, as 
well engage with the wider community.  In contrast , citizens who lack the capacity to digest complex and 
competing source of digital information and make appropriate judgements may fall into the traps of the 
digital economy, including financial fra ud and (especially for young people and children) physical and other 
forms of abuse and exploitation.  
The extent to which the spread of the digital economy is inclusive and broad -based will depend on 
the inclusiveness of the five foundations.  Equity in dig ital skills across the population is likely to play a 
particularly important role in sharing the prosperity promised by the digital economy.  A concerted effort is 
required to equip the young population with digital skills.  
Digital skills is one of the five  foundational pillars in the World Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa 
(DE4A) initiative , which includes Country Diagnostics on the state of the digital economy, a Scorecard to 
set targets and monitor progress, and World Bank investments and technical support  (See Box 1) .  As the 
term “digital skills” came to be used loosely across different pillars and strands of work, this paper starts 
with the framework that can help to define these skills and the programs/courses that could help to achieve  
them.  
Broadly speaking,  the digital skills for citizens and the general workforce and digital skills for the ICT 
professions involve different domains and competences and require different frameworks which specify the 
relevant competences and proficiency  levels.  These are summarized in Figure 1  and further detailed in the 
next section.

Box 1: The Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative  
 
Prepared to support the implementation of the AU Digital transformation Strategy for Africa, the World 
Bank’s Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) Initiative sets out a bold vision to ensure that every African 
individual, business, and government is digitally  enabled by 2030. The goal is to drive the digital 
transformation of Africa and ensure its full participation in the global digital economy.  
 
• The DE4A takes the approach of strengthening the enabling foundations that help advance a digital 
economy that promotes social inclusion and poverty reduction.  In case a country has good enabling 
foundations, it is on the path of developing a robust digital economy. The reverse may also be true. Based 
on the examination of the experiences of successful compan ies and public sector institutions that form 
digital economies, those foundations are taken to be: the availability of internet or broadband which 
brings people online, the ability to identify and authenticate people digitally, and the ability to pay or 
transact digitally. Digital economies further energize when there is sizeable population of tech -savvy 
workforce, and an ecosystem that supports firms to enter or scale up in ways that brings about digital 
transformation across sectors. Once those foundation s are in place, a wide array of use -cases can emerge, 
mostly driven by the private sector, in a digitalizing economy, bringing new products, services, and 
delivery channels.  
Measurable goals for 2021 and 2030 have been proposed with a DE4A Scorecard coveri ng High -Level 
Indicators and Targets as well as pillar specific High -Level Indicators ( Annex 1 ). 
 
The DE4A Initiative is also fully embedded in the IDA 19 Commitments. Key commitments include 
support to ensure: i) To help close the digital infrastructure g ap, IDA will support 25 IDA countries to 
double their broadband penetration (16 on the African continent), including eight in landlocked 
countries, by 2023; ii) 50 percent of entrepreneurship and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSME) projects will inc orporate digital financial services and/or digital entrepreneurship elements – 
and ensure they address particular constraints facing women and people with disabilities ; iii) At least 
60 percent of IDA19 financing operations for digital skills development will support women’s access 
to higher productivity jobs, including online work; iv) All IDA19 financing operations for  
Digital Development will support women’s increased access to and usage of digital services; v) Support 
at least 12 IDA countries to adopt universally accessible  GovTech solutions; and vi) Support building 
client capacity in 50 percent of IDA FCS countries  to use field appropriate digital tools for collection 
and analysis of geo -tagged data; and apply this technology to enhance project implementation and 
coordination.  
 
The DE4A initiative has  prepared a Country Diagnostics Tool to guide the World Bank’s mul tisector 
task team in carrying out an assessment of the five pillars of the digital economy , as well as cross -cutting 
areas . This tool is current ly in the process of being deployed in a large number of African countries.

 2. Framework s for Digital Skills  
Africa still lacks a comprehensive framework for digital skills, although some countries have 
developed broad fra meworks.  Many OECD countries  and some Asian and Latin American nations have 
developed frameworks to guide measurement of digital skills in the population and support the development 
of education and training materials2. A thorough review of existing Digital Skills Frameworks was 
undertaken as part of the background work for this paper. The list of the frameworks is given in Appendix 
Table A.  
The most comprehensive and widely used framework  for general digital skills  is the European Union’s 
DigComp 2. 0 and its more recent update DigComp 2.13, which identifies five areas with 21 competences. 
The five areas are : (i) information and data literacy; (ii) communication and collaboration; (iii) digital 
content creation; (iv) saf ety; and (v) problem solving (Carretero et al.  2017). For each competence, there 
are eight proficiency levels  (in DigComp 2.1)  grouped into four broad headings —Foundational, 
Intermediate, Advanced and Highly Specialized. UNESCO’s Institute of Statistics (2 018) has built on this 
framework to adapt it to developing country contexts, as part of its goal to develop a methodology that can 
serve as the foundation for the Sustainable Development Goal for digital literacy .4 As part of this adaptation, 
UIS has proposed adding two more competences to the EU DigComp  2.0 framework, to include 
competences related to devices and software operations, and career -related competences . A detailed 
explanation on the competency areas and  proficiency levels is given in Table 1 .5  Figure 2 indicates that 
while the proportion of the workforce that has the basic level of proficiency in multiple competences should 
ideally be large, this proportion will decline for those with higher levels of proficiencies.  
Figure 2: Digital Skills Framework  for General Workforce and Population - 7 
Competencies and 4 Proficiency Levels  
 
 
2 Existing frameworks can be grouped into two broad categories: (a) Digital competence frameworks, whic h identify key 
components of digital competence, at different levels of proficiency and (b) User skills level frameworks , which indicate digital 
skills needed by different types of digital users.  
3 DigComp 2.1 contains no conceptual updates to DigComp 2.0 competence areas and competences but it includes updates to 
proficiency levels and examples of use.

level of proficiency in digital l iteracy skills”.

 The proficiency levels reflect “the cognitive challenge,  … the complexity of the tasks as well as … 
autonomy in completing the tasks” (Carretero et al. 2017).  At the lowest levels (1 -2), a person is able to 
carry out a simple task with help; at levels 5 -6, the person is able to apply knowledge, solve problems and 
helps others; while at levels 7 -8, the person is a professional who is contributing to technical -scientific  
knowledge in that domain.  Box 2 provides  examples of competencies and proficiency levels for different 
uses.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 Box 2 Examples of Competencies and Proficiency Levels Required by Different Users  
Farmers : A mobile phone can help farmers to improve their earnings through their decisions regarding 
crops to grow, and markets to sell their produce. However, the degree to which this happens will depend 
partly on the technology (sophistication of the phone, conn ection to the Internet) and partly on the digital 
skills of the famer. The competence related to “ devices and software operations ” means that the farmers 
can input a SIM card into their phones, turn it on and charge it. Foundational “ information and data 
literacy ” skills would allow the farmer to receive text messages on their phone regarding weather 
forecasts, market prices of products, and effective farmer practices. With a high level of proficiency in 
the competence area of “communication and collaborati on,” a farmer could learn about connecting to an 
irrigation system and to program it by using online resources or tapping into an online community (UIS, 
2018).  
Students : At the foundational level of proficiency in “ creating digital content,” a student can create a 
digital presentation to showcase their work using, for example, a simple video tutorial from YouTube to 
animate the presentation.  In “ collaborating through digital technologies,” a student at an advanced level 
should be able to co -create data and  content for making a video, and be able to differentiate between 
appropriate and inappropriate digital resources (Carretero et al.  2017).  
Employee : A person who is seeking to improve their career opportunities would be able to use the tools 
of a massive open online course (MOOC) to enhance their learning experience.  This would require 
intermediate level proficiency in the competence area of problem solving (“ creatively using digital 
technology ”) (Carretero et al.  2017).  
 
Digital skills for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) profession s require a 
separate framework that describes the  highly technical content and composition of skil ls applied in 
the ICT workplace. The EU’s e -Competence Framework 3.0 provides a useful reference that covers 4 1 
competencies required and applied in the ICT professions , using a common language for skill levels that 
can be understood across  Europe  (see Figure 3).6 A similar framework exi sts in the US called the Skills 
Framework for the Information Age (SFIA) . In East Asia, Japan’s ICT Dictionary is most commonly used 
as a reference framework for digital skills for the ICT professions.  
The e -Competence framework articulates competences req uired and deployed by ICT professionals 
(including both practitioners and managers). It was created for managers and human resource (HR) 
departments, for education institutions (universities, technical training institutions) and training bodies, 
policy mak ers and other organisations in public and private sectors. It can therefore be used (with necessary 
adaptations) to assess the quality of ICT and engineering programs at the university and TVET level, as 
well as those provided outside the formal education system.7

As digital technologies penetrate an increasing number of sectors and occupations, sections of the 
workforce that are in “non -ICT professions and occupations” will also require more specialized 
digital competences characteristic of ICT technicians and specialists.  Hence, there is not a strict one -
to-one mapping between the two frameworks and the two broad groups of professions.  Nevertheless, this 
distinction is useful especially in the African context where the majority of workers are i n non -ICT 
professions and occupations but will increasingly require basic or intermediate level digital skills as 
enumerated in the UNESCO DL GF/EU DigComp  2.1 framework. The digital skills proficiency levels in 
this framework provide an indication of the c omplexity of the tasks that can be undertaken  by non -ICT 
specialists . For example , foundation or basic level of proficiency  in digital skills represents abilities required 
to carry out simple tasks using simple digital technologies, such as the capacity to  use basic digital devices 
or applications. Basic digital skills are typically used in vocational or informal sector occupations and 
occupations involving routine tasks  – for instance, Uber drivers, grocery delivery personnel, etc . 
Intermediate level profi ciency  would typically be required in middle -level occupations such as the general 
workforce in formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs)  that are using a range of digital technologies  – 
small firms and shops engaging in e -commerce and using digital payme nts, journalists who can use digital 
tools for collecting, searching and analyzing information . Advanced level proficiency , which requires 
greater analytical skills as well as theoretical knowledge, is typically required in occupations with a high 
level of  ICT intensity . Figure 4 presents a rough mapping of broad categories of occupations according to 
two education -related dimensions – the theoretical and analytical dimension and job -specific competences 
8– and the use of the two frameworks presented in this section.  
Digital comp etences, apart from the most rudimentary ones —such as using a mobile phone for voice calls 
or simple messages —cannot be developed without foundational literacy and numeracy skills . Certain 
competences, such as communication and collaboration, as well as hi gher levels of proficiency in all areas 
of competence, also require socioemotional skills . These include characteristics such as perseverance, 
empathy, trust, self -control and self -esteem, among others.  However, even foundational skills are lacking 
in maj ority of the population, including among young people after several years of schooling, particularly

 in SSA.  Hence, developing even basic digital skills will require ensuring a minimum level of literacy and 
numeracy.

 3. Demand for Digital Skills  
The spread of digital technologies may change the demand for skills in two opposing ways.  First, there 
could be an increase in demand for basic and intermediate digital skills which help workers deploy these 
technologies, as well as advanced digital and higher -order cognitive and socioemotional skills which allow 
workers to leverage digital wo rkplaces to engage in nonroutine tasks. Second, there could be a decrease in 
demand for routine skills or manual labor due to automation.  
There is little systematic data on how the demand for digital skills or skills more broadly is changing 
in Africa.  However, analysis presented in a background paper for the World Development Report 2016 
on Digital Dividends indicates that “employment in occupations intensive in ICT use at work in developing 
countries has increased by 10 percent between 2000 and 2012, alm ost two times the increase in developed 
countries” ( Monroy -Taborda et al, 2015) .   
The emergence of new industries and services in the digital economy, as well as the spread of digital 
technologies in many traditional manufacturing and service sectors, is likely to stimulate demand for 
digitally intensive occupations.  The ICT sector itself and emerging ICT intensive sectors  such as e -
commerce, Internet enabled offshoring and online work, bioengineering, and so on, will require a workforce 
with a range of di gital competences from intermediate to advanced and highly specialized levels. Moreover, 
demand will also emerge from the traditional sectors  which are increasingly using digital technologies, 
such as, agriculture, construction, transportation and logistic s, manufacturing, banking and finance, health 
and government sectors), in which the different categories of occupations, ranging from scientific to the 
professional, middle -level and vocational occupations, will require new digital skills.  Further, while the 
ICT and ICT -intensive sectors are not in themselves labor -intensive, they generate low -skilled and medium -
skilled jobs in services such as retail, food preparation, and cleaning .9 
Box 3: The demand for digital skills will be ubiquitous in the formal secto r 
The World Economic Forum (2018) global surve y of companies provides a glimpse of the forthcoming 
transformations across industries, including Africa.  The vast majority of companies in e ach of the 12 industries 
surveyed will adopt one or more of the 19  new technologies listed in th e survey.10   the highest level of adoption 
will be in user and entity big data analytics (85 percent of all companies), app and web -enabled markets (75 
percent ), internet of things (75 percent), machine learning and cloud computing (73 percent).  Skills in these areas 
will be demanded by over 65 percent of all industries —with ICT, professional services, global health, and financial 
services demanding these skill s the most.  
The other technologies that would have the biggest level of adoption include: digital trade (e -commerce), 
augmented reality, encryption, new materials, wearable electronics, 3D printing, blockchain, and robotics.  These 
technologies overall wil l be introduced in over 37 percent of all companies , with digital trade adopted in 59 percent.  
The WEF survey also defined the new jobs and new roles of workers. Top jobs that are expected to  be in high 
demand moving forward are : data analysts and data scientists, A rtificial Intelligence (AI)  and machine learning 
specialists, general and operations managers, big data specialists, digital transformation specialists, sales and digital 
marketing professionals, software applications developers  and analysts,  and innovation professionals.  Based on 
these surveys, the redundant roles are likely to be  data entry clerks, accounting, bookkeeping and payroll clerks, 
assembly and factory workers, client in formation workers. Analysis by LinkedIn in 2019, using its global database 
reveals a  trend of rising demand for jobs such as data scientists, AI and machine learning specialists , listing them 
on top of global demand including demand in Africa. Further, eve n where earlier jobs continue, workers and 
professionals would need to have hybrid skills —not only the skills of their core profession, but also digital skills . 
 
9 The World Development Report 2016 notes that “Kenya’s mobile money service M -Pesa uses more than 80,000 agents … 
Hormuud Telecom —the largest operator in Somalia —employs 5,000 staff but supports 25,000 agents.” ( p 106).  
10 The 19 technologies are: 3D printing, Aerial and underwater robots, App - and web -enabled markets, Augmented and virtual 
reality, Autonomous transport, Biotechnology, Cloud computing, Digital trade, Distributed ledger (blockchain), Encryption, 
Humanoid rob ots, Internet of things, Machine learning, New materials, Non -humanoid land robots, Quantum computing, Stationary 
robots, User and entity big data analytics, Wearable electronics.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 For instance, an accountant would not only need the usual accounting knowledge, but also skills in spreadsheets, 
databases, etc.  A marketing director needs to also have skills in digital marketing,  social  media, and content 
marketing and using search engine optimization.  
a Note :  Only cities with 100,000 LinkedIn members were included  in this estimat ion, which uses the skills and 
employment listed on the LinkedIn profiles of people.  
 
However, the effective demand for digital skills from the informal sector, especially agriculture and 
services where the majority of people are employed in Africa, is l ikely to be constrained.  This is 
because of high levels of income volatility, precariousness of employment, and high opportunity costs that 
reduce participation in training or skills upgrading. This may constrain the spread of digital technologies in 
these sectors. Yet, it is pre cisely in these labor -intensive sectors where relatively simple technologies such 
as mobile phones can help to improve productivity in, for example, agriculture through better information 
on weather and prices, as well regular technical advice on operation s. Small service providers —food sellers, 
tailors, and so on —can expand markets through the use of social media. The informal manufacturing sector 
may also benefit from digital technologies such as 3D printing which allows for small scale and 
customizable t ools.  
Finally, ensuring that all citizens, especially young people, have basic digital skills is crucial for the 
extension of e -government services and for inclusion in the new economy.    
The extent to which disruptive technological change is labor saving  in Africa will depend on the 
number of routine tasks in jobs, that might make them susceptible to automation, relative wages and 
the lags in adoption of technology.  In general, with lower wages and slower rate of technological adoption, 
the risk of automa tion drastically reducing jobs is lower, which gives time for governments to put in place 
policies for upskilling the population (World Bank 2016).  However, each country needs to do this analysis 
to assess the demand for digital skills.  
Artificial intelli gence enabled approaches can provide real -time and predictive guidance on in -
demand skills and identify skills gaps , especially for the formal sector or for employers and workers 
engaged in the digital economy .   Traditional methods of assessing demand (em ployer surveys, industry 
consultations, focus groups) can take a long time, and results can become quickly outdated when the job 
market is rapidly changing. Further, the skills assessed are not granular enough to provide guidance to 
training providers to c hange their courses. An example of such a platform is JobKred, which has developed 
algorithms to predict the top job occupations, and top skills within these jobs which are demanded by the 
local area market.  Careers and skills recommendations engine is bu ilt by these methods to yield actionable, 
relevant and accurate career and employment data.  
 
However, in the informal sector, there are many knowledge and information failures that prevent 
the matching of demand and supply of skills . Many small firms, whe re the owners themselves have low 
levels of education, are often not aware of new technology and new skills needs.   As in the case of other 
skills, matching the supply with the demand for digital skills is best done in the context of programs that 
offer technical, financial and marketing services to the informal sector.

 4. Supply of Digital Skills  
While a large proportion of the population in Africa has some familiarity with using mobile phones, 
their capacity to handle a broader set of digital devices and services are likely to be very limited. 
Information about  the current status of basic digital skills in the population  is sparse .  The rapid spread of 
mobile phones and mobile Internet services, in particular, means that a large proportion of the population 
has some familiarity with devices (mainly phones), some digital services (government service s and 
payments), as well as social media. However, with the limited penetration of fixed broadband, computers 
and laptops, both in homes and educational institutions, it is highly unlikely that there is even basic 
familiarity with broader digital services.  Access to digital devices does not necessarily translate into 
acquiring digital skills, except the most foundational. Although many countries have introduced ICT as a 
subject in school education, in practice, most schools are not able to teach even basic skills because of the 
lack of electricity, devices, and access to digital materials or the Internet. Only a few have introduced 
computer -assisted instruction.  
Cross -national t ask-based measures of digital skills suggest that the share  of the population with 
basic digital skills is very low in a number of countries in Africa.  Figure 5 presents the proportion of 
the population with basic, standard ( which roughly  correspond s to intermediate level in Figure 2) and 
advanced digital skills  based on self -reported behavioral measures of digital skills . The figure suggests that 
there are considerably lower proportion of people in Africa  (Togo, Niger, Cote d’Ivoire, Djibouti and 
Tunisia)  with basic, standard and advanced digital skills compared t o countries in Europe, Asia and South 
America. It also points to a large within region differences whereby selected Northern African countries 
have a higher proportion of the population with basic, standards and advanced digital skills.  
Generally speaking,  information about the levels of digital skills is very limited. This is partly due to 
the lack of reliable metrics of digital skills as well as limited availability of any data on digital skills in 
Africa based on a representative sample. Many of the exis ting measures of digital skills are based on self -
reports or proxies based on possession of devices or tasks performed (see Annex 1). Many of the existing 
large -scale household or labor force surveys in Africa do not systematically collect information on d igital 
skills.  
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

Figure 5: Proportion of the population with basic, standard and advanced skill levels 
(2017)  
 
Note: Measuring the Information Society Report (2018). ITU’s figures are based on  Botswana (2014), Cabo Verde (2015), Côte 
d'Ivoire (2017), Djibouti (2017), Niger (2017), Egypt (2016), Morocco (2017), Sudan (2016), Togo (2017), Zimbabwe (2014) . 
ITU’s figures also assume that an individual has basic digital skills if he/she has  engaged in at least one of the following four 
computer -based activities during the last 3 months: (1) copying or moving a file or folder, (2) using copy and paste tools to duplicate 
or move information within a document, (3) sending e -mails with attached files, and (4) transferring files between a computer and 
other devices . These task behaviors broadly correspond to DigcComp2.1/UNESCO’s proficiency levels 2 in the Competency areas 
‘0: Devices and software operations’, and ‘2: Communication and collaboration’, and proficiency levels 1 and 2. The assumptio n 
is that individual’s proficiencies in DigComp2.1/UNESCO’s Competence areas 0 and 2 are correlated with those in other 6 
Competence areas. Another assumption is that the data from 10  of countries  represent data from the African continent.  ITU’s 
figures also assume that an individual has advanced digital skills if he/she has  engaged in the following computer -based activities 
during the last 3 months : writing a computer program using a specialized programming language . This task behavior broadly 
corresponds to DigcComp2.1/UNESCO’s proficiency level 5 in the Competency areas ‘0: Devices and software operations’, and 
‘3: Digital content creation. The assumption is that individual’s proficiencies in DigComp2.1/UNESCO’s Competence areas 0 and  
3 are correlated with t hose in other 5 Competence areas. Another assumption is that the data from 10 cou ntries are representative 
of the African continent.  
Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
19 
 An alternative  way to assess the supply of digital skills is  to use information on the completion of education , 
assuming th at some form of ICT training11 is provided in education institutions  (see Figure 5).  Knowing 
the state of provision of school education, it is likely that students in high schools in the majority of African 
countries acquire only basic digital skills  (if ICT is included in the curriculum and actually delivered).  
Intermediate level skills may be provided at the upper secondary level.  A mor e careful assessment would 
require matching the ICT curriculum with the  competences and proficiency levels in the UNESCO/EU 
DigComp framework.  Digital skills for the ICT professions could be delivered at the upper secondary level  
and in TVET institutions  and technology programs in short -cycle tertiary institutions  (at the technician 
level), in university undergraduate programs in engineering, sciences, mathematics and related fields  and 
postgraduate programs in the same fields. Again, an assessment of the  curriculum of these courses against 
international frameworks such as the EU e -Competence framework would provide a better estimation of 
the skills of the students in these courses.  
Hence, using the proportion of students at different levels of education and in different types of ICT related 
courses could provide a rough estimate of the supply of digital skills through the formal education system.  
This mapping should be taken as indicative as  because much of the learning in SSA schools, including in 
techn ology related courses at the school level, tend to be theoretical and focused on rote learning which do 
not develop the competences listed in the above -mentioned frameworks.

“digital skills training ”

 5. Provision  of Digital Skills through Formal Education and Training Institutions  
 
5.1 Fostering  digital skills through  the formal education system  
 
The digital competencies listed in Table 1 can be acquired through formal education and training 
institutions for young people and on -the-job formal training and informal training (such as peer -to-
peer learning) for those in the workforce . Increasingly, online learning and blended learning are 
supplementing traditional training methods and vastly increasing the potential for enhan cing access.  
 
Universalizing basic digital skills  
Basic digital skills refer to the proficiency levels 1 and 2 in the framework outlined in  Table 1 .  A person 
who is proficient at this level would be able to do simple tasks that involve remembering content and 
instructions but also requires some guidance to execute.  
In sub -Saharan African, b asic digital skills programs can be offered in high schools (lower secondary 
schools) , covering grades 7 -9/10 approximately  and also at higher levels of education for those students 
who have not had access to digital skills training.   Apart from a few more advanced countries in Southern 
Africa, Kenya etc., it is un likely that primary schools have the minimum required infrastructure to provide 
digital skills training.   In Northern Africa, on the other, basic digital skills training can be provided in 
primary schools as well.  
An important decision is whether to provi de “stand alone” basic digital skills training to students or to 
integrate the use of digital technology across the curriculum.  Experience shows that the latter takes a long 
time, as teachers need to become confident in the use of technology and digital c ontent.  A promising way 
to start is to introduce basic digital skills training as a “subject” for high school students.  Essential steps in 
this process are definition of a curriculum,  selection of digital content  teaching methods, and assessment; 
the pro vision of devices that can be used by students in sequence but in such a manner as to allow equitable 
access; stable source of supply; connectivity to the internet  and regular, frequent training of all teachers 
(not just the ICT teacher) . 
An extremely impo rtant aspect is ensur ing that there is adequate and consistent technical support for 
teachers and students to troubleshoot issues with hardware, software, internet connection and use of content.  
Adaptation of existing basic digital skills curricula traini ng such as the International Computer Driving 
License (see below) is one quick way to introduce basic digital skills training.  
Intermediate digital skills for the general workforce and for ICT professions  
Intermediate digital skills refer to proficiency l evels 3 and 4 in the framework outlined in Table 1.  The 
student is able to independently perform simple tasks and well -defined and routine tasks, and 
straightforward problems, and where he/she is able to remember and to understand.  
Intermediate digital skills programs can be offered in lower and upper secondary schools  and should be 
made available to all undergraduate students in universities . Because intermediate digital skills require a 
greater understanding of content  in different  situations, they are best provided as part of teaching other 
courses. This means that use of digital technology needs to be integrated across several subjects. To begin 
with this could be done, in language and mathematics, as well as science subjects.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
21 
 Integrating digital technology into teaching is far more complex than providing “stand alone” digital skills 
training at the basic level of proficiency.  It is ideal if the school has a plan for the use of technology, and a 
heavy emphasis on teacher developme nt and continuous support is required. Careful selection and curation 
of digital content appropriate to each subject is time consuming and requires technical expertise.  
For the ICT technicians, courses at the level of e -1 and e -2 of the EU e-competence framework ( Figure 3 ) 
are appropriate and these need to be provided in technical upper secondary schools and post -secondary 
TVET institutions.  
Advanced digital skills for non -ICT and ICT professions  
Advanced digital skills refer to proficiency levels 5 and 6 in the DigComp 2.1/DLGF  outlined in Table 1 . 
For those in engineering and  ICT professions, advanced digital skills refer to the proficiency level 4 in the 
e-Competence for ICT Professions framework ( Figure 3). A person who is proficient at this level would be 
able to deal with and provide guidance to others on different tasks a nd problems that involve applying and 
evaluating content in complex situations.   Advanced digital skills are required for African countries to 
diffuse and adopt new digital technologies across many sectors of the economy.  
Advanced digital skills programs for ICT courses require greater theoretical content and would typically be 
provided in relevant undergraduate courses  in universities and other tertiary level courses . Typically, these 
would cover : 
• Engineering course s, specifically electrical and computer e ngineering courses  (4-year courses) - 
these would constitute the core of the advanced digital skills programs  
• Mathematics, science and related undergraduate courses  (3-year courses) in universities and 
technology courses in tertiary institutions  
The discipline of electrical and computer engineering is fundamental to the technologies of the 4th industrial 
revolution when artificial intelligence systems will be ubiquitous. Hen ce, reforming the content, pedagogy 
and assessment of these courses should be a priority  (Box 4). 
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
22 
  
Box 4: Advanced digital skills for the ICT professions require  reform of core engineering courses  
in universities  
Given the rapid advances in scientific knowledge, it has become impossible to fully train an engineer in the four 
years typically allotted for a baccalaureate degree at a university, or even in the cumulative total of eight to nine 
years typically consider ed adequate for an advanced (Ph.D.) degree. The implication is that no engineering 
curriculum should set out to provide a student with all the technical knowledge (s)he needs for a lifetime career.  
What is required is to structure a training program that focuses on imparting the fundamentals of the field, and on 
providing the students with the skill to learn how to learn on their own.   
  
The typical electrical and computer engineering curriculum at an African university differs significantly from that 
of a university in a developed country, for example in Korea or Singapore.  While most electrical and computer 
engineering curricula in the developed world are four -year programs, some African universities have five -year 
curricula for a baccalaureate degree. The key differences are:  
• A heavier course load in each year  
• The type of courses included in the curriculum, some of which are not directly relevant to core subject 
material for electrical and computer engineering  
• The content of the courses, which do not sufficiently emphasize the fundamentals, breadth and depth.  
• Lecturing as the dominant mode of instruction; no recitations and rare tutorials with small groups  
• Very large class sizes, ranging from 80 -150 students.  
• No capstone project  by students  
• Almost exclusive reliance on the final examination (no weightage to homework or continuous assessment)  
 
Engineering curricula and syllabi are not regularly revised in African universities and the lack of widespread 
accreditati on of engineering programs in sub -Saharan Africa by international bodies has serious implications for 
the quality of engineering programs in Africa.  
 
Modern engineering curricula are typically structured to fit within a four -level scheme that emphasizes c ertain skills 
and core knowledge.  At the base of the scheme are courses that impart foundational knowledge in the sciences 
(physics, chemistry, and biology), mathematics, and computing (computer literacy). The foundational background 
is followed by a set of courses considered to constitute the core subject matter of the particular engineering 
discipline.  Next, the student is exposed to the breadth of the subject after which (s)he can select one or two areas 
for an in -depth study. In addition to the course work, a typical four -year undergraduate program generally offers the 
student an opportunity to work on a capstone design project during the third or fourth year of their study.  Such 
projects usually have a minimum duration of at least one academic semeste r but could also extend to a full academic 
year.   Capstone projects are intended to help students assimilate and internalize core engineering concepts learned 
in the course of their study.  Most capstone projects at world -class universities are generally team projects intended 
to develop and impart interpersonal skills for working in teams; this is in addition to learning how to manage and 
cope with unknown factors as well as known (resource and time) constraints on projects that are designed to closely 
emulate real -world working conditions.  
 
Note:  Adapted from Towe (2019), consultant report.  
 
Highly Specialized  Digital Skills  for the ICT professions  
Although the UNESCO/EU DigComp framework outlines h ighly specialized digital skills  (proficiency 
levels 7 and 8 in Table 1 ), which could in theory be available to citizens and the general workforce, in 
practice this would be difficult to provide in the African context in most educational or other institutions.  
For the ICT professions, t hese skills , representing e -4 and e -5 levels of the EU e -Competence framework 
in Figure 3 ,  are typically provided at the postgraduate level (Masters and  doctorate level ) focusing on 
advanced computer science/ engineering, applied mathematics  and related fie lds, and cater to occupations 
such as data scientists and AI engineers . The availability of high-quality  postgraduate programs in these 
areas is very limited, especially in sub -Saharan Africa, outside of South Africa.  This has an impact on the Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
23 
 quality of undergraduate training and also on the limited ability to develop new solutions and applications 
of digital technologies.  Development of high-quality  postgraduate programs requires a high concentration 
of resources and alignment with international benchmar ks for quality ; for smaller countries or those with 
weaker capacity, this is likely done best at the regional level, and for all countries, high quality regional 
programs can supplement national efforts.  
 
5.2 Fostering  digital skills outside the formal education system  
 
A few case examples are provided to show how different levels of digital skills are being provided 
outside the formal education system.  However, it must be noted that these levels may not exactly 
correspond to the frameworks mentioned in this paper and th ey are given for illustrative purposes.  
Basic Digital Skills  programs  – case examples  
 The International Computer Driver’s License (ICDL)  offers courses that are for beginners with no prior 
computer or internet experience (intermediate level courses are also offered – see below). The ICDL is a 
computer literacy program which is based entirely on the European Computer Driver’s Licence (ECDL)  
program, operated by the EDCL Foundation, and its syllabus, content and assessment methods have not 
been adapted to country contexts. Its syllabus is divided into modules and standardized tests are taken by 
the student after completing a module. It is adm inistered by accredited test centers  operated by course 
vendors, educational establishments, large organizations or companies, using guidelines provided by the 
ECDL Foundation.  ICDL appears to be the world's leading computer skills certification organizat ion. 
According to its website, more than 14 million people in over 150 countries have engaged with the ICDL 
program through a network of over 24,000 ICDL Accredited Test Centers (ATCs). ICDL is present in 
almost all African countries. For instance, in Sout h Africa, there are more than 50 ATCs, in Kenya more 
than 80, in Uganda 14 and in Rwanda 8.   
Box 5: ICDL in Kenya   
Kenya is an interesting example of full -scale adaptation (not adaptation!) of ICDL. Based on a government decision 
in 2009, ICDL has become the st andard offering for organizations across the public and private sector. Recently, 
ICDL Africa signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Kenya School of Government, to offer 
ICDL to public sector workers across the KSG campuses throughout Kenya. E ach year, over 10,000 new candidates 
register for the program, taking over 50,000 certification tests annually. ICDL Africa operates through an office in 
Nairobi, with a team of 4 full time staff, providing support to the large network of ATCs. Organizatio ns wishing to 
become an ATC, must first be accredited by the Technical Vocational Education and Training Authority (TVETA). 
The network of ATCs covers wide variety of sectors, including schools, technical training institutions, universities, 
Government ins titutions, NGOs and commercial training organizations. Every autumn, ICDL Africa hosts its 
annual ATC Forum, bringing together all ATCs, as well as key stakeholders in the ICT and education sector to 
discuss updates to the ICDL program and share best pract ice from around the  world.  
ICDL was adopted into national law in Kenya in 2009 when the Information and Communications  Act recognized 
the ICDL Certification as ‘the entry level computer certification designed to demonstrate competence in computer 
use'. (Th ailand has also officially recognized ICDL as an education standard. However, to our knowledge no 
European country has adopted ECDL into its legislation.)  
As a result, all training courses in Kenya meet the ICDL standard (earlier some computer literacy courses were of 
low quality) and employers can easily compare (formal) IT qualifications of applicants and employees. 
Unfortunately, no sources indicate how far the substance of the ICDL, which basically is PC -based, would benefit 
from including m ore on skills related to the use of mobile phones, which have been the important drivers of the 
digital economy in Kenya. It would be important to get an assessment of the appropriateness/need for adaptation 
of the ICDL from members of the business communi ty in Kenya.  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
24 
  Given the extremely low level of literacy especially in SSA countries, even the introductory courses of 
ICDL may need to be adapted for use in schools.  Box 5 provides information about the  implementation of 
ICDL in Kenya.  
The Digital Doorway (DD) project , launched in 2002,  provides  freely accessible ICT centers  in the form 
of “containers” . They  encourage digital upskilling and computer literacy in rural areas of South Africa  
through unassisted - and peer -assisted learning . Container DDs are placed in disadvantaged localities to 
improve the digital and informational literacy of disadvantaged children, youth and adults through 
experimentation and exploration by allowing them to “learn without formal training and minimal external 
input”12. Based on the open -source software Ubuntu Linux, the content of container DDs includes the 
OpenOffice suite, educational programs  and content including interactive scientific simulations , an 
introduction to computer terminology, scientific software, 10 000 books, Wikipedia, etc. This allows for 
“varying computing activities ranging from entertainment to independent research.” (Gush,  2011)  DDs 
come equipped with internet  and local  wireless  hotspots  for the content to be accessible to anyone with a 
browser.  A joint initiative of the government and private sector in South Africa, more than 240 systems 
have been deployed across all 9 pro vinces of South Africa as of 2013  with the latest installation being in 
2019 . Each DD has the potential of reaching hundreds of users.  70% of users are below the age of 21 years. 
They have also been deployed across other  African countries like Ethiopia, Lesotho and Uganda while also 
being deployed in Australia and Solomon Islands.  Each c ontainer house s a multimedia computer system  
with three or four user terminals . Container DDs are solar -powered and hence self-sustainabl e “robust and 
vandal -proof” units designed to thrive in areas without power or shelter.   
 
PraDigi  was launched in 2017 in rural India spearheaded by Pratham13. 10,000 Google tablets have been 
distributed to 50,000 children across 900 villages. Pratham, an influential non -profit, provides numeracy 
and literacy e -content and partners with Slam Out Loud, another non -profit which provides performance 
and visual arts -based educational content and training14. The goal is to provide a cross -disciplinar y 
education and digital literacy in a non -formal setting through self -paced and personalized learning tools . 
The content caters to children aged 3 to 14 years but the rigor  adjusts to each child’s learning levels. The 
freely accessible tablets provide  contextual and  interactive content in regional languages. PraDig i, a spin 
on the word ‘prodigy’, encourages deeper mastery by promoting group -based learning and assignments 
through shared tablets. PraDigi staff visit villages once a week to assess student prog ress through qualitative 
observational data and to troubleshoot. This allows student progress to be measured holistically.  
 
Intermediate digital skills  programs  – case examples  
Various examples of intermediate digital skills training outside formal education are available, as described 
below and summarized in Table 2. 
 
The ICDL  also offers intermediate digital skills modules.  Although the content was originally oriented at 
the s kills a general office worker needs (word processing, spreadsheet, database and presentation), in 
2013 ICDL was broadened when a number of modules were added like project planning, 2D 
computer aided design, health information systems usage, ICT in educatio n, web editing, image 
editing and digital marketing. The ICDL Profile Certification allows candidates and organizations 
to decide on the combination of programs they wish to implement, according to individuals 
academic, business and job needs. The ICDL Pro file Certificate is issued to the candidate to 
demonstrate the various modules he or she has successfully completed .

 The IC-3 Digital Literacy Certification  is another course which is provided by Certiport (a product of 
Pearson Virtual University Enterpri ses), a for -profit provider of certification exam. These are courses for 
students or employees seeking to pursue a career in IT or  enhance knowledge in the use of technology. The 
course content includes areas related to online usage (internet, browsing, na vigation, email communication, 
digital citizenship, computing fundamentals, managing computer files, computer devices, configuration etc.  
It also covers common applications like word processing, presentations, slide design.  The course can be 
delivered on line or online/offline training, and the certification requires passing three individual exams to 
validate competency.  
 
The Microsoft Digital Literacy Certification is a popular course which is free and open -source.  This is 
targeted to all users with basi c reading skills who want to learn the fundamentals of using digital 
technologies, such as working with computers, accessing information online, communicating online, 
participating safely and responsibly online, creating digital content in word processing,  collaborating and 
managing content digitally. The course can be delivered online self -paced individual study or face to face 
classroom delivery. To obtain the digital literacy certificate, users require to pass 70 percent or higher. The 
biggest advantage of this course is that it is free and is an open -source, unlike the first two examples where 
user fees are charged.  However, a limitation is that the course is linked to a particular vendor’s software 
and may not give sufficient breadth of understanding t o the student.

 Advanced Digital Sk ills for ICT  – case examples  
 
Advanced digital skills training outside the education system (or in partnership with universities) are 
provided by a variety of for -profit providers through on-line and blended programs , and also through rapid 
skills training  (“bootcamps”).  
 
Examples of online and blended programs  are provided in Table 3.   They range across topics like computer 
language programming, artificial intelligence (AI), big data analytics, data science and cloud computing to 
name a few. Due to a wide variety of courses and proficiency levels within these programs, courses are of 
varying lengths . These initiatives are provided in a mix of both formats from purely online programs 
(including paid courses and MOOCs) to in -person training programs.  
 
Rapid training in a dvanced digital skills15 outside the education system, particularly  in the software 
industry, have  recently become very popular.  Such training sessions are usually on current topics that are 
in sudden high demand.   Because the standard c ourses take more time to prepare graduates, universities, 
even in advanced countries, are unable to respond to spikes of demand in certain areas, particularly in 
coding.  Universities can themselves offer such bootcamps over a summer session, but more rece ntly many 
for-profit companies have become active in this type of training, especially when the need is in some of the 
most popular high -level computer languages such as Python, C++, PHP, Java, etc.    
 
However, c oding bootcamps work best for individuals w ho already have background in the structure of 
computer languages but who do not have any experience programming in the particular language that there 
is a demand for.   For these individuals, having someone show them the gist of the language, immediately 
allows them to make connections to their mental (logical) concept of the syntax they expect for a computer 
language.  Learning is then very fast, and within a short time, they are coding very well.  For anyone lacking 
in the underlying structure of how hig h-level languages are constructed, the lessons can be confusing, and 
often frustrating.    
 
Another area where bootcamps are popular is machine learning —a subarea of artificial intelligence; again, 
rapid training courses in this area tend to be more useful  for individuals who have the mathematical 
background relevant to machine learning. This background is found in algebra, particularly in the field of 
matrices. Concepts in manipulating large (two and three dimensional) matrices are key to machine learning.  
The coding of algorithms (into software applications) for performing the manipulations can be meaningless 
if one does not have the conceptual framework on matrices.  
 
The delivery of these programs is best organized in partnership with the private sector to ensure that the 
course meet the requirements of the specific jobs in current demand.

5.3 Challenges in fostering digital skills in Africa  
A special feature of SSA countries is the lack of basic literacy and numeracy skills in a huge section 
of the population, which are essential prerequisites for the acquisition of even the most rudimentary digital 
skills. Self -reported literacy rates among young people are high —for example, 70 percent of young people 
aged 15 -19 report themselves as literate in most countries. But actual reading proficiency tests done in the 
two SSA countries show functional literacy rates to be much lower. Recent studies in SSA countries have 
found that the majority of fourth grade students cannot read a paragraph and close to ninety percent could 
not solve a mathematics world problem; for eighth and ninth -grade students in South Africa, close to half 
of the students did not have basic mathematical knowledge, including adding and subtracting whole 
numbers. Furthermore, over 50 million children under the age of 15 are estimated to be out of school (Bashir 
et al.  2018) . 
The creation of advanced digital skills  for the ICT professions, through engineering, computer 
science and related programs,  is restricted by the low access to post basic education . Across the region, 
enrollment rates in upper secondary education (grades 10 -12) are extremely low. In SSA, the av erage is 
about 28 percent, but in many countries, it is less than 15 percent. In higher education, the gross enrollment 
ratio is below 10 percent. Enrollments in technical -vocational education are below the average in other 
regions. Limited enrollment in m athematics and science streams in lower secondary and upper secondary 
and high failure rates in these subjects restricts the pipeline of those who could enroll in technical, 
professional, mathematics, and science courses in higher education. Estimates indi cate that less than a 
quarter of the small number of students in higher education are in mathematics and science courses. Further, 
gender disparities become acute in upper secondary and higher education, with very few girls participating 
in the technical a nd professional courses that lead to high -end jobs in the digital economy.  
Equally important is the poor quality of courses and teaching in technical -vocational and higher 
education, especially in the technical -professional and mathematics courses.  Lack of  qualified faculty 
is one major issue, with many university faculties  in SSA not having a postgraduate qualification. Even 
more serious is the lack of industry experience, which is especially important in the fast -changing 
environment of digital technologi es. Most universities still offer outdated courses in computer science 
courses, electronics, and telecommunications and information management systems. Key specializations 
that are considered necessary for a broad and deep digital economy are missing: thes e include cybersecurity, 
mobile computing, network and cloud technology, ICT hardware and service infrastructure, IT management 
(ITM), software development and engineering, storage and data, digital multimedia, big data, data analytics, 
artificial intellig ence, and so on.  
Formal education and training institutions are important for preparing the pipeline of young 
workers and citizens for the digital world.  Training opportunities for those who are currently out of 
school or those in the workforce are equall y important. For this enormous stock of the population, there are 
limited opportunities for training and few formal sector firms invest in the training of their workforce. 
Digital technologies may offer the chance to multiply the offerings of training on b asic digital skills which 
are linked to their jobs.  
Migration of high -skilled workers with digital skills can dampen the efforts made by countries to 
increase the supply of workers with advanced and highly specialized digital skills.  African countries 
vary considerably in the levels of economic development as well as the size and maturity of the labor 
market. Some countries with a relatively underdeveloped labor market for advanced and highly specialized 
digital skills (e.g., Lesotho) face risks of their hi gh-skilled worker with digital skills migrating to 
neighboring countries in search for a market that can reward those with such skills (South Africa). While 
there are clear benefits of brain drains (e.g., remittances), the efforts made by countries to fost er digital 
skills may be dampened.

 5.4 Adaptation of existing courses/ programs  for basic digital skills  – is this a feasible option?  
 
Development of new curricula and digital content is expensive and time -consuming. In low capacity 
environments, a choice has to be made between development versus adaptation of existing curricula and 
resources.  However, the costs and effort required for meaningful adaptation must not be underestimated, 
as apart from technical capacity requirements, issues related to copyright, intellectual property and licensing 
costs must be considered.  
For instance, the provision of basic and intermediate digital skills could be based on the ICDL. However, a  
change or extension of the ICDL program is not straight forward because the European C omputer Driving 
Licence ( ECDL ) program is owned and controlled by the ECDL Foundation. The Foundation could be 
approached to know on what terms is would consider collaboration with the Bank (or other actors) on 
developing new modules/subjects. The last upd ate of the ECDL was in 2013, and adaptation could be 
included as part of the next update (the date is not yet known).  
  
It would be preferable to collaborate with the ECDL Foundation and its network of national partners on 
changing and extending the ICDL program. The ICDL certificates seem to be widely recognized by private 
and public employers, and the infrastructure for t eaching and testing is well developed in several countries. 
An alternative system would be costly to establish and to maintain, and (at least in the beginning) it would 
not be known by employers. Before the Bank teams up with the national ICDL system, it w ill however 
require an assessment of the capacity and credibility of the relevant national structures and partner 
organizations.  
 
It would also be useful  to undertake an independent evaluation of the de facto competences of the holders 
of the different lev els of ICDL certificates and of the reliability of the testing system. This could be 
conducted by a qualified research institute.  
 
In general, this would require a regional approach, as it would be expensive to conduct the exercise of 
adaptation on a case by case basis.

 6. Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and Intermediate Level  
The measurement of digital skills in the population is not done extensively in SSA and is still at a 
nascent stage in most countries. Difficulties of designing and administering the survey, including 
access to devices, posed considerable challenges. Nevert heless, systematic assessment based on 
an accepted framework is required.  Annex 2  provides more details of the issues involved  and 
Appendix Tables C and D  indicate sample questions  from surveys and aggregation of indicators 
by Eurostat.  
 
  Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs  
 
31 
 Annex 1: Indic ators and Scorecards for Digital Skills in the 
Digital Economy for Africa Initiative  
 
The DE4A initiative proposes two high -level indicators to assess progress  
 
• Percentage of lower -secondary schools with access to internet for pedagogical purposes  (target: all 
lower -secondary schools by 2030)  
• Proportion of youth and adults with advanced digital skills (target: 100% by 2030)  
 
The frameworks used in this paper, the Digital Literacy Global Framework, based on DigComp 2.0/2.1 and 
the EU e -Competence fra meworks, adapted to African contexts - can be used to define different levels of 
digital skills.  
 
Basic digital skills  
A large proportion of young people are still out of lower secondary school, especially in sub -Saharan Africa, 
but also in parts of North Africa, and it would be logistically difficult to provide the same level of basic 
digital skills training to all out of school children, many of whom will lack of foundational literacy and 
numeracy skills. Further, it is impossible to have one test that wi ll measure the performance of all children.  
It is therefore better to consider two indicators for basic skills : 
 
• For children in lower secondary school :  Percentage of children in the terminal year of lower 
secondary education who acquire basic digital sk ills, equivalent to Foundation Level 2 in the 
DigComp Framework.  
 
• For current out -of-school children :  Percentage of children aged 15 years who acquire basic digital 
skills, equivalent to Foundation Level 1 in the DigComp Framework.  
 
Provided that all basic digital skills programs for these children are based on the DigComp Framework, and 
assessments test this level of proficiency, the completion of these programs could be treated as an indicator 
of acquisition of very basic digital sk ills.   
 
For the former group, it is better not to specify the age, as children will be of varying ages due to repetition 
and late entry in primary and lower secondary.  Further, due to the high failure rate in the lower secondary 
examinations, it is prefe rable not to use “completers” but all those who are in the terminal year of the lower 
secondary cycle.  
 
Integration of the basic digital skills program in the lower secondary curriculum and assessment based on 
this would allow collection of data on how ma ny students acquire basic digital skills.  
 
Advanced digital skills (ICT professions and occupations)  
The purpose of this indicator is to identify how African countries are developing the capacity to drive the 
digital economy through ICT and ICT -enabled industries and services. Although it is desirable to assess 
the level of advanced digital skills in the workforce, it is not feasible to do so.  It is feasible t o measure the 
new entrants into this workforce , as represented by the number of  graduates of undergraduate level 
programs in engineering, computer science, mathematics and physics . Ideally the programs would be 
assessed against the EU e -Competence framewor k (proficiency levels e -3 and e -4) or related framework. 
It would also include graduates of online, blended and rapid skills training programs provided such 
programs can also be assessed against the same framework . Digital Skills: Frameworks and Programs

 Annex 2: Measurement of Digital Skills at Basic and 
Intermediate Level  
 
In this section, we cover only digital skills at basic and intermediate level, since the advanced and highly 
specialized skills are typically measured through assessment and certification by the formal education 
provider (university or online provider).  
 
Currently, measures of basic/ intermediate digital skills constitute a small portion of large -scale surveys 
intended to understand ICT usage levels or adult skills of a popula tion.  The principal surveys are indicated 
in the following Annex T able 2.1. 
 
Survey questions assess digital skills in two ways. The first method is based on self -assessment by the 
respondent and is the most commonly used approach. The second method is to  use an indirect form of 
assessment, by posing questions about the types applications that the respondent can use.  
For example, when an individual uses an application that is conceived to be difficult to use, this is held to 
be an indication of a high lev el of skills (Deursen et al.  2014). Sample questions from such indirect 
assessments can be found in Appendix Table  C. 
 
The DigComp 2.1 Framework is used to guide the identification of a limited set of indicators for the 
purposes of measurement of digital c ompetence within the EU (and a number of other countries for 
comparative purposes) through an ICT survey about activities realized during the previous 3 months within 
four domains: information, communication, content creation and problem solving. It is ass umed that 
persons having realized certain activities (e.g. copying or moving a file or a folder or using copy and paste 
tools to duplicate or move information within a document) have the corresponding skills. However, as the 
data is self -reported, they are  likely to be positively biased.  
 
The Eurostat indicators are simple (the indicators for all the domains are listed in Appendix Table D. At the 
overall level the digital skill indicator defines four levels of skills: no, low, basic and above basic; whereb y:  
• ‘No’ refers to individuals who answered none in all categories, plus those who have not used the 
internet in the last 12 months or who have never used the internet;  
• ‘Low’  refers to individuals having one or more ‘none’ in three domains;  
• ‘Basic’  refers to individuals having one or more ‘basic’, but no ‘none’;  
• ‘Above basic’  refers to individuals with ‘above basic’ in all four domains.  
 
A similar simple indicator for digital skills would be appropriate for measuring at the population level in 
Africa. Such an indicator could be inspired by the indicators and aggregation methods used by Eurostat to 
measure digital skills. However, the indicators must be ‘Africanized’ as some of them are more relevant to 
PC users in Europe than to users of smartphones in Afric a (e.g. copying or moving files or using a formula 
within a spreadsheet).  
 
Most of the basic and intermediate digital skills programs listed above administer performance tests with 
the purpose of certifying the level of digital skills. Examples of most com monly used certification programs 
include Microsoft Digital Literacy Standard Curriculum, CISCO Networking Academy, International 
Computer Driving Licence (ICDL), Internet and Computing Core Certification (IC³) Digital Literacy 
Certification, etc.

Abstract  
The paper discusses the arguments for inclusion of cybersecurity awareness building in 
development assistance programs. We note that cybersecurity awareness building can 
strengthen the resilience of productivity -enhancing services, such as mobile banking a nd e-
payment systems, and benefit economic growth. We develop a typology of cybersecurity 
strategies involving government, the private sector and the international community. The 
paper describes an Australian -funded program delivered by Monash University t o overcome 
cyber errorism by strengthening cybersecurity capacity and awareness in Myanmar and 
explains how and why it was delivered. Drawing on the program’s experience, the paper 
identifies various challenges to managing an effective program as well as e ight lessons 
learned which might be applicable to other programs. Key among the lessons learned is the 
need for a solid understanding of how the internet is accessed and used in the host country, 
and the need for local content to attract target audience at tention.

 2 Introduction  
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have transformed the way in which we 
live, the way we do business, and the way we communicate. They are drivers of productivity 
gains and economic growth, and are essential for participation in the global e conomy. Most 
of us are enjoying the convenience that the Internet brings. And since the advent of the World 
Wide Web in 1989, ICTs have evolved rapidly. We are now in the age of the Internet of 
Things (IoTs) where almost every machine is connected online, and many services can also 
be transacted through the Internet. The importance of the Internet to the economy and all 
aspects of society has led governments to inclu de the Internet in what they consider to be 
national critical infrastructure.  
However, as t he Internet was originally built for research rather than commercial use, 
security was not taken into consideration in its design ( Chang,  2017; Lessig 1999). With the 
popularity of the Internet, criminals also see the opportunity to commit crime u sing the ICTs 
or by targeting the ICTs. According to the 2017 Internet Crime Report, the Internet Crime 
Complaint Centre (IC3) under the Federal Bureau of Investigation received 301,580 
complaints with an estimated loss of USD 1.418 billion in 2017. (Internet Crime  Complaint 
Center, 2018). In Australia, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet found that 
cybercrim es are costing the Australian  economy “up to $1 billion annually in direct cost 
alone”. (ACIC, 2019).  
Cybersecurity has become a concern for individuals, organisations and states as reports of 
hacking, data theft, system shut -downs, fraud and hate speech create fear and anxiety about 
the use of new technology, the so -called “cybercrime.”  To prevent this, cyber security 
technologies, policies a nd regulations are developed. However, many users do not follow the 
rules and regulations or fail to practi se the  expected  behavio ur while they are using ICTs. 
While most systems are technically secure, a great proportion of cybercrime is enabled by 
“human  error” (Kelly, 2017 ). “Cyber Errorism” , that is , cybercrime and cyber security 
breach es caused by human error or behavio ur, have become key concern s in the field of 
cybersecurity. We are starting to see more resources being allocated to the promotion of  
cyber security awareness  to harden society against cyber errorism .   
Academic study has emerged on the design and effectiveness of cybersecurity awareness 
campaigns. For example, one  study led by the Global Cyber Security Capacity Centre at the 
         
          
 3 University of Oxford assumed (on the basis of a 2013 study on user compliance behavio ur 
towards health information system security) that cyber security awareness campaigns fail to 
change behavi our (Bada, Sasse and Nurse: 201 5). It reviewed current behavioural psychology 
literature and applied psychological theories to awareness and behavio ur in the area of cyber 
security to get an understanding of the reasons why changing cyber security behavio ur is a 
challenge. The study also identified “many psychological theories of behavioural change that 
can be used to make information security awareness methods significantly more effective”. It 
concluded that the following five factors could enhance the eff ectiveness of cyber security 
awareness campaigns:  
● Security awareness has to be professionally prepared and organised  
● Invoking fear in people is not an effective tactic  
● Security education has to be more than providing information to users – it needs to be 
targeted, actionable, doable and provide feedback  
● Once people are willing to change, training and continuous feedback is needed to sustain 
them through the change period  
● Emphasis is necessary on different cultural contexts and characteristics when creating  
campaigns.  
De Bruijn and Janssen (2017) investigate why cybersecurity is not receiving the attention it 
deserves and how cybersecurity awareness can be created. They make the case for evidence -
based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of 
cybersecurity. Messages need to be based on facts and be framed in such a way that it is 
explained effectively to the public. Based on the more generic literature on framing and in the 
specific area of global warming, they propos e six strategies which frame cybersecurity in 
such a way that will generate more awareness:  
● Do not exaggerate the problem (this can lead to denial, apathy and fatalism)  
● Make it clear who the villains are (use examples of clear and unambiguous villains)  
● Give the fight against cybersecurity a face (put the heroes in the spotlight)  
● Connect cybersecurity to values other than security alone (eg economic benefits)  
● Personalise for easy recognition (different messages for multiple audiences)  
● Connect to other tangible and clear issues (eg the threat of IS, Islamic State).  
These early studies are mostly concerned with improving the effectiveness of the messaging 
in cybersecurity awareness campaigns. Other studies have focused on the need for 
         
          
 4 cybersecurity capaci ty building in developing countries (Muller, 2015, and Klimburg and 
Zylberberg, 2015) and its role in international cybersecurity governance norm development 
(Homburger, 2019). Although cybersecurity awareness raising and capacity building is now 
featuring  in a number of development assistance programs,  there is no academic study on the 
challenges in delivering them effectively.  
This paper provides a detailed account of the implementation of a donor -funded cybersecurity 
awareness campaign. Drawing on recent experience in Myanmar – a country where only 
since 2014 has Internet access become feasible – this paper evaluates the rationale for 
development assistance being directed at cybersecurity. Drawing further on the experience of 
an Australia n-funded program to strengthen cybersecurity capacity and awareness in 
Myanmar, it identifies various challenges to managing an effective program as well as eight  
“lessons learned”. Key among the lessons learned is the need for a solid understanding o f 
how the Internet is accessed and used, and the need for local content to attract target audience 
attention . 
Development of the Internet in Myanmar  
An estimated 3.6 billion people, about half the world’s population, are Internet users and 
most of these ar e in the Asia region (World Internet Statistics). And among these, Myanmar 
has experienced one of the fastest increases in the number of Internet users. In 2014, the 
mobile telecommunications market was opened to international service providers and Qatar’s  
Ooredoo and Norway’s Telenor were successful tenderers  breaking the monopoly previously 
held by the state -owned MPT (Myanmar Posts and Telecommunications). Since July 2014 , 
MPT has been a joint operation with Japan’s KDDI Corporation and Sumitomo Corporat ion. 
With the introduction of competition, the price of a Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) 
card dropped from around US$2,000 in 2009 to around US$1 in 2015. With this significant 
fall in the entry barrier to mobile telephony, together with access t o cheap handsets from 
China, the uptake in mobile phones surged. Telenor had 17.232 million mobile subscribers in 
2018 while Ooredoo reported it had over ten million active subscribers in February 2019.  
In January 2017, a third international license  was issued to Mytel, a joint venture between a 
consortium of eleven Myanmar companies operating under the name Myanmar National 
Telecom Holding Company (23%), Star High Public Company Limited (28% - part of the 
military -owned and managed conglomerate Myan mar Economic Corporation) and Vietnam’s 
         
          
 5 military -run and largest mobile network operator Viettel (49%) (Mytel , nd). It launched its 
4G-only network in June 2018. Mytel quickly reached 5 million subscribers and expects to 
double its Myanmar subscriber base to 10 million by the end of 2019 ( Vu and Nguyen, 2019) . 
Mobile financial services have also experienced phenomenal growth in recent years. Wave 
Money, a joint venture between Telenor, FMI, Yoma Bank and Yoma Strategic Holdings, is 
the leading provider of mobile financial services in Myanmar. It moved approximately 
US$1.7 billion in remittance in the first half of 2019. According to the company, more than 
11 million people have used the Wave Money platform to send and receive money, buy 
airtime, pay util ity bills and process digital payments ( Wave Money, 2019) . 
While Myanmar is one of the fastest growing mobile markets it also stands out for its lack of 
safe online practices. The low level of cyber security awareness among its internet users and 
low cap acity in government and IT dependent institutions make “cyber errorism”, cybercrime, 
cyber bullying and the online spread of hate speech serious risks for which Myanmar is ill -
prepared:  
“In economies characterised by low internet penetration rates and few resources 
devoted to fighting cyber -crimes, formal institutions related to such crimes tend to be 
thin and dysfunctional. A cyber -criminal is less likely to be stigmatised in such  
economies. Moreover, organisations’ and individuals’ technological and behav ioural 
defence mechanisms are likely to be weaker. Many people in developing economies 
are also attracted into cyber -crime because of high unemployment and low wages.” 
(Kshetri, 2010, p.1057)  
It is difficult to know the extent of cybercrime and malicious c omputer activity in Myanmar 
as no systematic research or survey has been undertaken. For the purposes of this paper, 
cybercrime refers to all breaches of cybersecurity and malicious computer -related activity 
irrespective of whether it is considered an offe nce under current laws. Commercial 
information security companies and organisations (such as Symantec, AV -test and Trend 
Micro) use malicious computer activity statistics to quantify cybercrime and information 
security problems. And Microsoft detects malic ious software globally through computers that 
run Microsoft real -time security software and produces its Microsoft Security Report . 
However, Myanmar is not included in any of these surveys (Chang, 2017, p.138) . 
         
          
 6 While Myanmar is not included in these surveys, there is evidence of cybercrime and 
malicious computer activity in Myanmar. Immediately before Myanmar’s 2010 national 
elections, the country’s main Internet provider, the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, 
came under a large Distributed Den ial of Service (DDoS) attack (an attack which makes the 
targeted system unavailable by flooding its bandwidth). In 2013, Google warned media 
organisations covering Myanmar that their Gmail accounts might come under state -sponsored 
attack (O’Toole , 2013).  
Other malicious activity includes sets of computers  hacking targeting specific entities to steal 
their data. For example, malware such as PLATINUM and Gamarue are particularly 
prevalent in much of Southeast Asia. While there is no verifiable evidence of th eir presence 
in Myanmar, it would be complacent to assume that Myanmar is somehow immune to 
malicious activity. Other forms of cybercrime have been detected in Myanmar. In 2014, five 
foreigners were accused of ATM scamming using cloned ATM cards and, in an  unrelated 
incident, a Bulgarian national was arrested for allegedly stealing US$38,500 from ATMs.  
With the development of e -payment and online banking in Myanmar, these types of 
cybercrime can be expected to increase.  
Notwithstanding the newness of wide access to the Internet in Myanmar, there is evidence of 
significant hacktivism. In January 2016, in response to the Thai Government’s arrest of two 
Myanmar migrant workers accused of murdering two tourists at Koh Tao, internet vigilantes 
(netilantes) launc hed a massive DDoS attack on nearly 300 Thai Government websites and 
brought many of them down. The Myanmar netilante group, Blink Hacker Group, is believed 
to be responsible for the attacks (Long 2016). Also in 2016, the Myanmar hacktivist group 
Cyberroot  and other hackers launched DDoS attacks on Bangladeshi Government websites in 
response the Bangladeshi Cyber Army’s “declaratio n of war” against Myanmar alleging 
mistreatment of Rohingya Muslims (Coe 2016). A report on cyber “maturity” (as 
demonstrated by  the presence, effective implementation and operation of cyber -related 
structures, policies, legislation and organisations) in the Asia Pacific region ranked Myanmar 
as least “mature” among the ten ASEAN member states, and placed Myanmar at 21 out of the 
25 cou ntries surveyed (ASPI , 2017) . 
Without safe online practices there is significant risk in introducing electronic voting, e -
government and e -payment systems in Myanmar. Globally, the majority of cybersecurity 
         
          
 7 breaches are caused by human error, rather t han the vulnerability of the computer system or 
hardware ( Kelly, 2017 ), there is a need to focus on the human factors to cyber security.  
The majority of people in Myanmar are new to the internet and less likely than well -
established users in other countrie s to be aware of the necessity to protect themselves online. 
As a result of this lack of awareness, easily preventable cybercrimes such as loss of mobile 
money, hacked social media accounts, and money stolen from bank accounts are , according 
to Myanmar cyb er security firms,  common in Myanmar. These could easily be prevented 
simply by raising user safety awareness.  
Combatting cybercrime and malicious computer activity  
Grabosky  (2016:123) states that “one of the most important strategies for the prevention and 
control of cybercrime is to increase public awareness of the risks that private individuals and 
institutions face, and how best to minimize them.” Other important strategi es include 
government and private sector cooperation, legislation to criminalise the various forms of 
cybercrime, the global harmonisation of cybercrime laws, and international cooperation 
including the development of capacity among criminal justice profes sionals to deal with 
cybercrimes (Chang &  Grabosky, 2017).  
Cybersecurity capacity building has been defined as “support and assistance aiming at 
empowering individuals, communities and governments to reduce risks stemming from 
access and use of informatio n and communication technologies. ” (Homburger, 2019, p.227). 
The Event Report of a European Union Institute for Security Studies’ seminar on capacity 
building in cyberspace reported that there was general agreement “that capacity building is 
something that  should leave recipient countries with the ability to enjoy the benefits of 
cyberspace, including in the economic and social domains”  (EUISS, 2013, p.2) . 
The various strategies can be mapped in the typology in Figure 1 below.  
(Insert figure 1 around here)  
In the typology, optimal cyber security is represented by the central area where all the circles 
overlap. It encompasses all stakeholders and all strategies, indicating that the various 
strategies are not options to choose  from but all are important to pre vent and control 
cybercrime. This leads program managers to ask whether their programs should embrace all 
         
          
 8 the strategies and, if this is not possible, is it reasonable to allocate scarce development funds 
to strengthen cybersecurity incompletely, in the fu ll knowledge that a major cyber security 
incident is a risk to the program? Precisely because cyber security is everybody’s business, it 
is difficult for even a well -funded and designed program to address each strategy. And there 
are some strategies that a re best addressed at the government -to-government level, rather than 
by a contracted implementing partner. For example, encouragement to sign and ratify the 
Council of Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime (Budapest Convention), which encourages 
signatories to  harmonise domestic criminal substantive law and procedural law and to 
establish a fast and effective regime for international cooperation (Chang , 2012) is likely to 
be more effective when government officials from a signatory donor country acknowledge 
and engage their counterparts. Similarly, international cooperation involving police and 
security agencies is traditionally undertaken at the police -to-police or agency -to-agency level, 
drawing on the mutual trust and respect that has been built through a his tory of cooperation 
on other matters.  
It is important that cybersecurity development assistance is a priority in the donor country. To 
be effective, it cannot simply be a priority within a development agency, it needs to be a 
whole -of-government priority a nd there needs to be coordination between the relevant 
government agencies. If this proves to be difficult then coordination with other donors is an 
opportunity to ensure that through collective efforts as many as possible of the strategies for 
the prevent ion and control of cybercrime in the recipient country are a ddressed.  
Australia’s International Cyber Engagement Strategy  
In October 2017, Australia’s then Minister for Foreign Affairs launched Australia’s 
International Cyber Engagement Strategy  (Commonwealth of Australia,  2017). The 
Minister’s Foreword to the Strategy  said it “sets out Australia’s plan to promote confidence in 
the online environment, increase economic opportunities, reduce losses attributable to 
cybercrime, minimise the risks of s trategic miscalculation in cyberspace, promote multi -
stakeholder Internet governance, protect human rights online and deliver sustainable 
development outcomes.”  
The Strategy  identifies the Internet as a vehicle to advance established development prioritie s, 
including human rights, sustainable development and inclusive economic growth. The 
Internet provides “an unparalleled opportunity for online democratic participation and the 
         
          
 9 promotion, protection and fulfillment of human rights…Beyond the realisation of  human 
rights, connectivity and the uptake of digital technologies also act as a profound enabler of 
sustainable development and inclusive economic growth”.  
Having situated cyber engagement within the domain of development assistance, the Strategy  
commits Australia to  
“build their technical, legislative and institutional capacity to fight cybercrime. This 
will not only preserve our neighbours' economic growth, but also prevent the creation 
of cybercrime safe havens... Such capacity building also equips cou ntries to 
participate more constructively in international discussions on the future of 
cyberspace.”  
In May 2016, before the launch of the International Cyber Engagement Strategy , the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs announced the establishment of a Cyber Cooperation Program  to support 
the engagement strategy , especially across the Indo -Pacific region. Homburger (2019) 
situates cybersecurity capacity building in the realm of the debate on international norms. She 
argues that capacity building is necessary t o make adherence to internationally agreed norms 
feasible, but it can also serve as a tool for fostering donor state’s interests in recipient states. 
She notes  that China and Russia favour a new universally accepted International Code of 
Conduct on Informa tion Security formulated within the UN framework, while the United 
States and EU member states promote the EU -drafted Budapest Convention (promoting use 
of existing international law and governance based on freedoms, human rights and the 
openness of cybers pace) (Chang, 2012; Homburger, 2019: 233 -234, 237).  
Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines is the only country that has ratified the 
Budapest Convention. However, Myanmar and most other member states have enacted 
legislation to regulate cybercrime based on the provisions of the Budapest Convention 
(Chang, 2017: 142 ; Chang, 2020 ). ASEAN has its own agreements and forums that provide 
an opportunity for cybercrime cooperation. Indeed, the founding principle of ASEAN is to 
promote regional peace and sta bility and to promote active collaboration and mutual 
assistance on matters of common interest (ASEAN Declaration, 1967). In 2004, the Joint 
Communique of the Fourth ASEAN Ministerial Meeting on Transnational Crime recognised 
cybercrime as a transnational crime affecting ASEAN’s security and urged effective legal 
cooperation (ASEAN 2004). Cooperative and emergency response procedures to maintain 
         
          
 10 and enhance cybersecurity and to prevent and combat cybercrime are also a part of the Plan 
of Action to Implement  the Joint Declaration on ASEAN -China Strategic Partnership for 
Peace and Prosperity (2016 -2020) (ASEAN 2015). ASEAN Telecommunication and IT 
Ministers meetings have also been a driver for cyber collaboration, including agreement in 
2003 that all member st ates should establish national Computer Emergency Response Teams. 
The ASEAN ICT Masterplan 2015 goal to make ASEAN a global ICT hub incorporates a 
number of initiatives, including to raise cybersecurity awareness through public education 
(ASEAN 2015). The various ASEAN cyber initiatives have contributed to Myanmar’s 
cybersecurity development, although being a party to a regional initiative in itself is 
inadequate without effective implementation to make it meaningful and useful.  
A constraint on active coll aboration on cyber matters is the digital divide – the vastly 
different levels of cyber maturity among the ASEAN member states. The digital divide is 
defined by the OECD as “the gap between individuals, households, businesses and 
geographic areas at differ ent socio -economic levels with regard both to their opportunities to 
access information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to their use of the internet for 
a wide variety of activities” (OECD 2001). Narrowing the digital divide is considered to be 
an important step towards economic development  (Evers and Gerke 2013) .  
Myanmar Cyber Security Awareness Raising  
The project “Strengthening Cyber Security Capacity and Awareness in the Indo -Pacific 
Region: Australia and Myanmar” was one of the first to be funded by the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and Trade under Australia’s Cyber Cooperation Program  and Internation al 
Cyber Engagement Strategy . Led by  Monash University, and i n collaboration with the 
National Cyber Security Centre, the Myanmar Computer Emergency Response Team 
(MMCERT) and private internet security company Kernellix, the Program was designed to 
strengt hen Myanmar’s cyber security capacity and raise cyber security awareness among 
government officials, IT practitioners/industry and the general public. Recognising that 
although each of these groups  was vulnerable to “cyber errorism”, they  had different nee ds 
which  the Program targeted : 
● A social media campaign, “Cyber  BayKin” (baykin means safety in Burmese), to raise public 
awareness ; 
● A facilitated workshop in Nay Pyi  Taw for government officials to identify their needs and 
         
          
 11 build professional networks across ministries  
● Creation of a private sector cybersecurity alliance to foster information sharing and formation 
of industry views to feed into the drafting of regulatio ns and legislation  
● Lectures to students at Myanmar’s Universities of Computer Studies . 
A campaign hub group , co-founded by Dr Lennon Chang  from Monash University  and Mr 
Ye Th ura Thet from Kernellix,  was created as a local organization to design and manage the 
program, including by first identifying types of cybercrime in Myanmar that were in greatest 
need of being addressed, and identifying the potential victims. Key messages, program design 
and part ner agency selection followed.  
During the approximately six months long research phase of the program, many meetings and 
panel discussions were held with stakeholders from government ministries, financial 
institutions, telecom companies, local and internat ional tech companies, and IT academics. 
Several main issues were identified, some of which were surprising to non -Myanmar 
participants:  
o New to the internet/social media:  the m ajority of people in Myanmar are relatively new 
to social media and still unaware of some of the dangers of online hate speech or smear 
campaigns. Most o nly know about Facebook and think Facebook is synonymous with the 
internet. They do not have the basic know -how to use the internet and tend to use 
Facebook as their only source  of news and information, which makes them very 
vulnerable to fake news . 
o Lack of technology literacy: many customers are not technically capable of setting up 
their various internet user accounts. They will often buy their mobile phone at a shop and 
have a ll their email, social media, mobile money accounts set up by shop clerks. 
Similarly, with online banking, they will let the bank staff set up their account with a PIN 
number or password and not change them afterwards. This type of naïve consumer 
behaviour  not only makes it easy for hacking in general but also results in numerous cases 
of internal theft within financial institutions.  
o Lack of regulation and policy: there are some broader issues that need to be addressed 
at the policy level, such as lack of a  coordinated effort to draft and implement cybercrime 
laws. At present hackers who steal money online have little risk of getting caught, and 
face no serious consequences even if they are caught.  
         
          
 12 o Lack of resources: banks and businesses often lack resources  to prevent online theft and 
reduce its impact on their bottom line.  
o Cultural stigma in Myanmar:  Generally speaking, people in Myanmar do not seem to 
care about privacy as much as people do in Western countries. They believe it’s bad to 
keep secrets from family and friends. This attitude then translates into their online 
behaviour. Users do not bothe r to use the most basic safety measures such as use secure 
passwords, lock mobile phone screens, or protect their banking information.  
o Need for self -empowerment:  users do not see the importance of preventing themselves 
from becoming victims.  
As part of the  social media strategy, instead of using cyber security campaign material from 
other jurisdictions , Myanmar comic characters were created to engage the Myanmar 
audience. The CyberBayKin  comic strip has seven characters  (Figure 2) : four women, two 
men and a stray dog. The central character is Mi Kay, a female university student specialising 
in cybersecurity. She is the heroine who can solve all the cybersecurity and hacking problems 
of others. Phwar Cho is a woman over sixty years of age who likes to use he r mobile phone to 
access Facebook and to share posts. May Se is a younger woman, around 30-year-old, and a 
wealthy company owner. She likes to use her mobile phone and tablet for online shopping. 
Thar Noe is the hacker. He causes trouble for others and has plenty of spare time at work. 
May Shal is an 18-year-old, female, first year university  student who likes to take selfies and 
who checks -in wherever she goes. She is popular on Facebook and Instagram. Kwee Kyaw is 
an over 30-year-old male with a good income and holds a senior corporate position. He uses 
gadgets (smart watch, mobil e phone, tablet and laptop) and various online services (including 
Facebook, Twitter, online gaming and Youtube). The stray dog, Ga Lit, gets along with all 
the characters other than the hacker, Thar Noe.  
(Insert Figure 2 around here)  
There is a strong  tradition of reading comics in Myanmar and a thriving community of 
cartoonists and illustrators. By creating original and local content, the campaign aimed to 
reach the most unaware internet users, old and young, urban and rural, directly through social 
media and public outreach events  (see figure 3) . By combining internationally proven tactics 
and Myanmar -specific content in Myanmar language with cultural sensitivity, the campaign 
aimed to reach as many internet users as possible.   
         
          
 13 (Insert figure 3 around  here)  
A Facebook page has been used as the main channel to distribute the comics 
(https://facebook.com/cyberbaykin ). Facebook is synonymous with  the Internet in Myanmar . 
Almost all internet users in Myanmar are Facebook users. It is also the best way to engage 
internet  users from both urban and remote areas.  Comic books were also printed for 
dissemination , especially to remote area s. 
The campaign was launched on 11 June 2018, and in the twelve months since then the 
Facebook page had attracted more than 7,500 organic likes. Thirteen comics were produced 
in the first year. Each comic reached around 15,000 users on Facebook with the comic on 
phishing reaching 158,700 users1. The Facebook followers number is increasing steadily 
without any buy -in likes or paid advertisement. The CyberBaykin  campaign has been listed 
on the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s eLearning course on cybercrime as a 
good example of a cyber security awareness campaign . (See 
www.unodc.org/elearning/en/courses/course -catalogue.html#cyber , accessed on 22 August 2019.  
Content only accessible to registered institutions.) .  
Messages  
Identified campaign topics included, but were not limited to, phishing, hacking, changing 
passwords, personal information protection, cyber bullying, hate speech and online stalking.  
Several key messages featured strongly in the campaign:  
o There is a strong likelihood of getting hacked if you don’t protect  your safety online (risk)  
o Cybercrimes can be prevented (action)  
o High cost of inaction (financial or data loss)  
o What is cyber bullying (recognition)  
o Stop hate speech (sensitize), and propose response tactics  
Within the generalized framework proposed by Bada, Sasse and Nurse  (2015),  the 
CyberBaykin comic strip campaign was professionally prepared and organi sed, it avoided 
creating fear, it provided actionable and doable information, the information campaign was 
                                                
1 As of 30 May 2020, there were 25,370 organic like s and some comics reached more than one million 
Facebook users.  
         
          
 14 sustained for over a year, and it was sensitive  to the different cultural context and 
characteristics of Myanmar. The CyberBaykin campaign, while not consciously informed by 
the de Bruijn and Janssen  (2017)  evidence -based framing strategies, is well -aligned with five 
of the six strategies they propose for cybersecurity campaigns. The CyberBaykin comic strip 
campaign was not based on fear, it’s clear who the villain and heroes are (Thar Noe and Mi 
Kay respectively), the societal benefits of cybersecurity awareness are key messages, and the 
use of local, identifiable characters ma de for a strong message framing strategy.   
Myanmar Cybersecurity Awareness Conference  
As can be seen from the typology of cyber security strategies  (Figure 1) , there is an important 
role for government to play in ensuring cybersecurity. In Myanmar, the newness of 
widespread access to the Internet has also meant that awareness of cybersecurity issues 
among government officials is not high and consequently cybers ecurity legislation and 
regulation are underdeveloped. Furthermore, the highly siloed nature of the bureaucracy in 
Myanmar has not encouraged information sharing and cooperation among Ministries. To help 
overcome these problems and in response to a request  from the Myanmar Cybersecurity 
Centre, one two-day Cybersecurity Awareness Conference was held in Nay Pyi  Taw, 
Myanmar’s capital (26 -27 November 2018). The conference program was derived from 
multiple meetings and panel discussions with cybersecurity stakeholders in Myanmar over a 
six-month  period. The conference aimed to strengthen the institutional  capacity of the 
Myanmar Cyber Emergency Response Team (MMCERT) and government network 
administra tion officials from multiple ministries. It also aimed to foster dialogue between and 
within ministries. The conference was opened by the Union Minister of Tra nsport and 
Communications, indicating a new level of government interest in the topic.    
The conference program included keynote speeches and presentations by six international 
and two Myanmar speakers, with simultaneous interpretation. Each presentation was 
followed by a Q&A session. A mixed panel discussion was held at the end of each day to 
facilitate exchange among government officials, academics, cybersecurity experts, industry 
representatives and educators. The conference attracted over 200 participa nts consisting 
mainly of government officials and network administrators, and representatives from the 
private sector and academia.  The post -conference survey of participants revealed broad 
satisfaction and requests from government agencies for follow -up conferences.  
         
          
 15 More than ten networking events were organised during the first year of the project to help 
players in Myanmar’s IT security industry build connections and form relationships. This led 
to the eventual establishment in July 2019 of the Myanmar Information Security Association. 
The Association will help build the trust and cooperation that underpins incident reporting 
and will facilitate public/private sector collaboration, including on the formulation of 
cybersecurity and cybercrime strategy, policy and legislation.  
Cyber security and safety ed ucation  
Over the two years of this program, e leven workshops/seminar s were provided to university 
students , including at the University of Computer Studies (UCS) Yangon, UCS Mandalay 
(twice), UCS  Pyay, UCS Taungoo , UCS Dawei, University of Information Technology 
(twice), Yangon  University (twice), and Parami Institute. More than 800 students were 
trained on cybe r security law , ethics  and awareness . More than half of the participants were 
female.  The topics were sel ected and prepared in collaboration with local university lecturers 
and the materials were given to the lecturer for their future use. The campaign team also 
helped with  professional comments on the establishment of  the Myanmar ICT curriculum and 
the drafting of Myanmar  cyber laws . 
Role of cybersecurity in an aid program  
Most economists would agree with the statement that “economic growth is the engine of the 
escape from poverty and material deprivation” (Deaton , 2013, p.327) and also that 
“institutions that provide dependable property rights, manage conflict, maintain law and order, 
and align economic incentives with social costs and benefits are the foundatio n of long -term 
growth” (Rodrik , 2003, p.10). For this reason, much development as sistance is focused on 
capacity building and institutional strengthening. Cybersecurity awareness raising and 
capacity building is congruent with the broader development objec tive through a 
strengthening of the resilience of the enabling environment for economic growth. 
Cybersecurity is essential for confidence in the integrity of mobile banking, e -government 
and e -payment systems which facilitate the internal transfer of resou rces from wealthier 
urban areas to poorer rural communities. In the words of the Australian Government, “the 
uptake of digital technologies also act[s] as a profound enabler of sustainable development 
and inclusive economic growth .” (Commonwealth of Austra lia, 2017) . Thus, cybersecurity 
capacity building can be viewed in the context of the traditional concept of capacity building 
         
          
 16 and accompanying donor -recipient relationships between developed and developing 
economies (Homburger , 2019, p.225).  
Under OECD De velopment Assistance Committee (DAC) definitions, no military equipment 
or services is reportable as Official Development Assistance (ODA). Anti -terrorism activities 
are also excluded (OECD , nd). Cybersecurity has dimensions that strengthen the security of a 
country from foreign interference, including from cyber attack. This paper is concerned with 
the other dimensions of cyber security that go to the heart of strengthening governance with 
positi ve development and gender equality outcomes in developing countries. Cybersecurity 
assistance to the Ministry of Defence, the armed forces and counterterrorism agencies is not 
the focus of the CyberBayKin program in Myanmar, nor of this paper.  
 Gender  
The Australian Government’s aid program lists ten targets at the strategic level to ensure its 
aid program is well managed, achieving value -for-money and making progress in delivering 
key Government priorities. The fourth target - empowering women and girls – is “more than 
80 per cent of investments, regardless of their objectives, will effectively address gender 
issues in their implementation” (DFAT , 2014 ). Progress on this target “might mean ensuring 
women participate in decision -making throughout implementa tion, identifying and pursuing 
opportunities for women to be employed through an investment, or addressing particular 
challenges to implementation”.  
There is no tension between this target and the objective of cybersecurity awareness. For 
cybersecurity awareness to be implemented effectively it must include all people with access 
to the internet, including through the use of smartphones. According to W ave Money, women 
in Myanmar are 30 per cent less likely than men to own a smartphone and 39 per cent less 
likely to use mobile internet for affordability, technology literacy and personal safety reasons. 
At the same time , Myanmar women manage 80 per cent o f the more than 41,000 Wave shops 
throughout Myanmar, earning agent commissions ( Wave  Money, 2019 ). An effective 
cybersecurity awareness campaig n must ensure that it is reaching women and girls.  
It is not sufficient to argue that the technology is gender neutral and women and girls are 
targeted no differently from men in technical campaign materials. For example, the choices 
made in depicting citi zens in campaign materials need to avoid gendered role models that 
         
          
 17 might stereotype males as teachers or as the masters of technology and reinforce social norms 
that exclude women. Women and girls need to be reached by the campaign materials for them 
to respond to the messages. Inclusion in the benefits from the enhanced protection that comes 
from adopting cybersecurity messages contributes to their economic empowerment and 
lessened cyber bullying, as well as to the effectiveness of the campaign. Cybersecur ity is 
maximised when everyone adopts cybersecurity practices.  
Demonstration of progress on this target in the cybersecurity awareness campaign in 
Myanmar has been straightforward. The central charact er in the comic strip created to 
disseminate awareness of risks and remedies to cybersecurity, Mi Kay, is a female IT expert 
and teacher. She is the heroine who gives advice to hapless victims on how to protect and fix 
devices vulnerable to hacking, financial fraud or mis -use such as on -line hate speech and 
cyber bullying. She gives the fight against cybercrime a face, one of the ways messages need 
to be framed to be effective (de Bruijn and Janssen, 2017). The portrayal of a woman in this 
role was a natural fit: the vast majority of teachers in Myanmar are fem ale and women are 
seen in important cybersecurity roles.  
Similarly, the Myanmar Cybersecurity Awareness Conference (26 -27 November 2018, Nay 
Pyi Taw) included female professors of computer science, ministers and senior officials as 
presenters and panellis ts. Approximately 65 per cent of the audience were female and from 
the public sector (Nay Pyi Taw is the newly created capital city and very much a government 
town). Enhancing women’s voice by using the skills and talents of Myanmar women 
advances both gen der equality and cybersecurity.  
Sustainability  
Ongoing relevance is central to the sustainability of the Myanmar Cybersecurity Awareness 
campaign. If the public’s interest in the campaign falters or declines then its effectiveness 
diminishes, and donor in terest in it will also decline. Interest in the campaign can be readily 
measured using the standard metrics of Facebook: number of likes and number of shares. 
These metrics can reasonably be regarded as proxies of the public’s demand for information 
on cyb ersecurity. To be sure, the metrics can be influenced by the campaign itself through 
payments to Facebook to “boost” visibility of the posts. While boosting has not been a part of 
the campaign strategy to date, it c ould be used to target a particular aud ience, such as women 
and girls, or to promote awareness of a particular issue such as cyber bullying.   
         
          
 18 It should not matter that funds are used to boost the visibility of the Facebook posts. The 
objective of the awareness campaign is to make as many peopl e as possible aware of risks, 
precautions and remedies related to malicious internet -based activity. Boosting is a legitimate 
and effective way of achieving that objective and may be considered for CyberBayKin  in the 
future.  While DFAT funding for this particular project was exhausted in mid -2019, the 
project has continue d with funding from local and international donors. This recognises that 
cyber security awareness raising is an ongoing task, partly because the message nee ds to be 
continuously reinforced and partly because every day there are new internet user s who need 
awareness training.  
 
In the world of development assistance, success breeds success. Donors want to ensure that 
their aid program is well -managed, achieving  value -for-money and making progress in 
delivering key government priorities. This is enshrined in Australia’s aid program and both 
“Working with the most effective partners” and “Ensuring value for money” are two of the 
program’s ten targets (DFAT 2014). A known and proven partner is generally preferred over 
an unknown and untested potential partner. Strengthened cybersecurity in the Indo -Pacific 
region is a key government priority ( Commonwealth of Australia,  2017) supported through 
Australia’s Cyber Cooperation Program  in the Indo -Pacific.  
Other donors, seeing what can be accomplished and which local organisations to  partner  
safely with, are willing to follow. This is an important achievement. There is much 
uncertainty when launching into a new fie ld of development assistance for the first time in a 
developing country. The pioneering development agency, in this case Australia’s Department 
of Foreign Affairs and Trade, lowers the entry barriers for followers. The identification of 
trusted and proven local partners, the engagement of both the public and private sectors, the 
evidence of local ownership, and the visibility of the program all appeal to potential program 
managers and capitals alike.  
There is risk in this too. Especially in capitals, develo pment programs on cybersecurity are 
seen as an opportunity to project an image of the donor as advanced and technologically 
sophisticated. There is little incentive for donor coordination when this is a motive . Similarly, 
program managers in development ag encies can be tempted to project an image of 
themselves as innovative and in tune with emerging priorities by developing a cybersecurity 
         
          
 19 program within their overall program. Because cybersecurity is a relatively new area for 
development assistance program s in Myanmar, the donor coordination groups that exist on 
the ground for established sectors such as education and health do not yet exist for cyber 
programs. There is, therefore, a risk of poor or non -existent donor coordination, duplication 
and competiti on for the time and resources of the few government officials, industry players 
and NGOs concerned with cybersecurity. The donor that identifies these risks can also 
mitigate them, primarily b y establishing an in -country donor coordination mechanism 
dedic ated to cybersecurity.  
Ultimately, the sustainability of a cybersecurity awareness campaign comes from the 
awareness itself. At this point, awareness of the importance of cybersecurity leads to new 
legislation and inclusion in school curricula, training pr ograms and in telecommunication and 
mobile banking company promotional material.  The EUISS cyberspace capacity building 
seminar report (2013:3) “agreed that we will have achieved good, sustainable and scalable 
capacity building  when the need is understoo d at all levels – among the citizenry, 
government, and institutions”. When this level of understanding is reached, local ownership 
is dominant and donor assistance might more usefully be targeted at Myanmar’s numerous 
and often remote ethnic minorities or geographic areas not otherwise reached by a broad -
based, Myanmar -language campaign.  
One of the mo re encouraging outcomes from the DFAT -funded cybersecurity capacity and 
awareness program has been the speed with which key private sector players gained an 
appreciation of the on -line risks to their customers and their business. In August 2019 
Telenor Myanm ar announced that it had partnered with Plan International, an independent 
development and humanitarian organisation working to advance children’s rights and 
equality for girls, to launch “Myanmar’s first nationwide Digital Literacy, Online Safety and 
Resilience Project”. The partners will also work with the Ministry of Education “to integrate 
online safety digital modules into the government education curriculum to prepare youths for 
a digital Myanmar” ( www.telenor.com.mm/en/article/telenor -myanmar -and-plan-
international -join-hands -improve -digital -skills -myanmar accessed 23 August 2019 ). In 
November 2018, Telenor Myanmar announced the start of a free Digital Schools program to 
provide basic computer literacy and safe internet training to 100,000 students. The 
announcement said Telenor had already trained over 130,000 students in core smartpho ne 
and computer skills and its safe internet programs had educated over 220,000 government 
         
          
 20 school students on using the internet effectively and safely 
(www.telenor.com.mm/en/article/telenor -commences -free-digital -school -program -train-
100000 -students -accross -country accessed 23 August 2019 ). 
Ooredoo, which has over 10 million active subsc ribers, is collaborating with GSMA (a trade 
body that represents the interests of mobile network operators worldwide) and Facebook in a 
101 Digital Literacy campaign to teach its customers through a simple online video how to 
use the internet safely and re sponsibly ( see https://ooredoo.com.mm/portal/en/digitalliteracy , 
accessed on 23 August 2019). The state -owned MPT announced in October 2017 that it 
planned to conduct 110 free seminars (in addition to the 195 conducted since the previous 
year). MPT said it  “aims to encourage knowledge growth amongst the country’s growing 
number of connected communities on the issues of unsafe online activities, security and how 
to manage unintentional data consumption for a more enjoyable experience”. Topics to be 
covered i ncluded “proper mobile usage and etiquette, internet safety, how to securely 
navigate the online environment from threats and deter cyberbullying, harassment, as well as 
safeguard one’s personal data in a connected world” ( MPT, 2017) ). MPT also supports a  
program to train trainers to be able to teach computer literacy ( MPT, 2019 ). 
The activities sponsored by mobile telephony operators are intended to enhance the customer 
experience. Concomitant with digital safety awareness is an enhanced understanding of the 
range of activities – including financial services – that can be undertaken with a mobile 
phone. They deepen the relati onship between the mobile service provider and the customer, 
enhance the customer’s experience and strengthen the company’s brand loy alty. This is good 
for the company while at the same time benefitting the customer and improving the enabling 
environment for economic development and inclusive growth . 
Lessons learned  
Several themes and lessons learned can be drawn from the experience of introducing a 
cybersecurity awareness campaign in Myanmar which might be of value to the design and 
implementation of further programs in Myanmar as well as programs in other countries , both 
developed and developing . 
Lesson 1:  Understanding context.  No two countries are identical in terms of cybersecurity 
awareness, extent of cybercrime and malicious computer activity, and capacity to deal with 
         
          
 21 these matters. For this reason, country level programs can be strategically focused and more 
effective th an regional or global programs. The first step in the design of a country -level 
cybersecurity awareness program is to establish a good understanding of the local context. 
This can be done by consulting recent reports or studies (if they exist) and by consu lting local 
stakeholders.  
Lesson 2:  Understanding stakeholders.  Potential stakeholders include government agencies, 
corporations, the not -for-profit sector and the citizenry. Building relationships with these 
groups is not straightforward. Governments ca n be suspicious of foreign interference or 
intelligence activity identifying system weaknesses and other vulnerabili ties. The private 
sector and not -for-profit sector will have individuals with information and views on cyber 
security risks and activities, but the issues are too new and the situation changing too fast for 
industry associations or peak bodies to have a se ttled view on the situation and on what needs 
to be done. Relationships and trust need to be built to avoid creating suspicion.  
Lesson 3: Bu ild a public -private partnership.  Both the government and private sectors have 
an interest in the security of cyberspace and should be involved in policy planning, incident 
reporting, awareness raising and other strategies to prevent and combat cybercrime and 
malicious computer activity. A public -private partnership is a key component in effective 
cybersecurity awareness programs.  
Lesson 4:  Coordinate with other donors.  Notwithstanding its newness, there is a need for 
donors in this area to coordinate their activities to avoid duplication and conflicting 
objectives.  
Lesson 5:  Identify or create a local partner.   A local partner can engage a broader range of 
stakeholders  than an English language -only contractor whose engagement is confined to an 
educated elite or constrained by slow and stilted communication through an interpreter. A 
local partner is also likely to more readily build trust with local stakeholders.  
Lesson 6:  Use or create local content.  A cybersecurity awareness campaign needs local 
content to be culturally sensitive and effective. To simply translate campaign material 
produced for another context risks using material that does not resonate with the local target 
audience either because the issues are different or less relevant or because the absence of 
local identifiers makes it harder to engage.  
         
          
 22 Lesson 7:  Identify problems and solutions.  It is too easy to simply identify problems such as 
the risk of cyber crime or the absence of adequate cybersecurity legislation without proposing 
a pathway forward. Cybersecurity is a new field involving technical concepts and regulatory 
approaches that many people in both developed and developing countries have difficulty 
comprehending. Even well -researched reports can end up on a bookshelf. A good donor -
recipient partnership is focused on implementation to achieve results.  
Lesson 8 : It’s not a one -shot activity. Cyber security awareness raising is an ongoing task  as 
the me ssage needs to be regularly reinforced and as every day there are new internet users .   
Conclusion  
There is a place for projects to strengthen cybersecurity capacity and awareness in 
development assistance programs. They help protect citizens from cyber bullying, hate 
speech and theft, and they strengthen the institutions that combat cybercrime and mali cious 
computer activity. They also help ensure the robustness of productivity -enhancing services 
such as mobile banking, e -government and e -payment systems. The limited academic 
research on cybersecurity awareness programs has proposed strategies, largely around 
framing the message, to increase the effectiveness of campaigns  and the policy argument for 
locating  cybersecurity awareness campaigns within official development assistance programs 
and the challenges and risks attached to those programs from a pra ctitioner’s perspective.  
In this paper, t he first donor -funded cybersecurity awareness campaign in Myanmar  is 
described, analysed , and a number of practical lessons are drawn out which might have a 
more general applicability.  While no formal assessment has been undertaken  on the 
effectiveness of the program , the statistics of the likes and reaches on Cyber Baykin 
Facebook page, media reports , UNODC curriculum  and the continuing support from local 
and international donors, is evidence supporting the view that Cyber Baykin has helped  
promot e cyber security awareness and  capacity  building  in Myanmar.  
A key finding is that for a campaign t o be effectiv e it needs  to understand  and be designed 
around  the individual country situation, especially its level of “cyber maturity”, and cultural 
factors. The program is considered sustainable when a wareness of the importance of 
cybersecurity leads to new legislation and inclusion in school curricula, training programs 
and in telecommunication and mobile banking company promotional material.  Early 
         
          
 23 evidence of this occurring in Myanmar is presented.  However, f urther funding will be needed 
to elevate the project to create more significant impact to Myanmar society  in cyber security 
awareness, education and capacity.

Abstr act
Backgr ound: There is a paucity of subnational data on patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in Tanzania to inform the
development of digital health interv entions.
Objecti ve: The aim of this study is to assess patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in pregnant women to inform the
feasibility and design of digital health interv entions for promoting timely uptak e of childhood vaccines in southern Tanzania.
Methods: Between August and November 2017, pregnant women in their third trimester were enrolled at health facilities and
from surrounding communities, and asked about their patterns of mobile phone ownership and use in an intervie wer administered
survey.
Results: Of 406 women, only 3 had never used a phone. Most women (>98%) could make and recei ve phone calls. Compared
to urban women, rural women reported higher mobile phone use rates but were less likely to be sole owners of phones, and less
likely to send or recei ve SMS, transact mone y, browse the internet, or use social media via mobile phones.
Conclusions: The findings suggest high feasibility for digital health interv entions delivered via mobile phones to pregnant
women in southern Tanzania. The feasibility of smartphone-based interv entions or strate gies relying on the use of social media
or the internet is limited.

Introduction
In recent years, many efforts have leveraged increasing
mobile-cellular subscription rates in low- and middle-incomecountries (LMIC) as a mechanism to promote childhood
vaccinations [1,2]. Examples of “digital health” strate gies for
promoting childhood vaccinations in LMICs include text
message–based delivery of educational content, appointment

RenderXreminders, conditional financial transfers, and tools to support
health care providers in vaccination delivery [1,2]. The
feasibility , successful implementation, and scale-up of these
digital health strate gies depends on the availability of
mobile-cellular infrastructure and patterns of mobile phone
ownership and use in target populations. Mobile-cellular
infrastructure and patterns of mobile use also provide insights
about the feasibility and potential success of next-generation
interv entions and technologies (eg, smartphone apps, wearables).
The government of Tanzania has developed a detailed
investment road map for the use of digital health interv entions
to strengthen the performance of the national health system [3].
Despite ranking 123rd among 143 countries in its Netw ork
Readiness Index, a measure summarizing the extent that
countries benef it from the opportunities provided by information
and communication technologies, Tanzania currently has the
third highest mobile cellular subscription rate in East Africa at
77 per 100 people [4,5]. In addition, several large text messaging
programs have been successfully implemented to deliver health
information to target populations via mobile phones. Examples
of such text messaging programs include the Wazazi Nipendeni
multimedia campaign and the mobile for reproductive health
educational messages for reproducti ve health [6,7] Yet, there
is little subnational data on mobile phone ownership and use
that are publicly available to inform the design and feasibility
of digital health interv entions.
In support of diverse research and interv ention studies in urban
and rural areas in Tanzania, we sought to develop a mobile
phone-assisted reminder and incentive system (mPARIS), a
digital health system capable of, among other things, sending
reminders and conditional financial transfers to mothers of
newborn children as a means of promoting timely uptak e of
childhood vaccines [8,9]. To inform the feasibility and design
of digital health interv entions using mPARIS , we used a
structured survey to assess pregnant women’ s mobile phone
ownership and use in the Mtw ara region in southern Tanzania.
The findings of the survey are reported below.
Methods
Mobile phone ownership and use were evaluated to inform
research on the feasibility and potential efficacy of SMS
reminders and conditional financial incenti ves for impro ving
the timeliness of childhood vaccinations in southern Tanzania.
The study protocol for the parent study , including objecti ves,
conte xt, and methods, was previously published [8]. The
protocol was registered in ClinicalT rials.go v (Protocol
NCT03252288) and appro ved by the Institutional Review
Boards at Duke University (Protocol 2017-0591) and theUniversity of South Carolina (facilitated review, Pro00051213)
in the United States, and the National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR) in Tanzania (NIMR/HQ/R.8a/V ol. IX/2194).
Methods pertinent to the analysis of mobile phone ownership
and use are presented below.
The study was implemented in one rural and one urban district
in the Mtw ara region in southern Tanzania. In 2015, Mtw ara
ranked 13th in the Human Development Index among
Tanzania’ s 21 regions. Between August and November 2017,
pregnant women were recruited from 4 urban and 8 rural health
facilities and their surrounding communities. Eligibility was
limited to health facilities that regularly provide childhood
vaccinations.
To participate in the study , women had to meet the following
inclusion criteria: be 16 years or older , be in the third trimester
of pregnanc y, have access to a mobile phone, and provide
informed consent. Eligible women recei ving antenatal care at
participating facilities were approached by trained study
personnel and offered enrollment in the study . Participating
women and local community leaders were asked to identify
other pregnant women in their community , who, if eligible,
were also offered enrollment in the study . Informed consent
was obtained from all participating women. Upon enrollment,
a trained research assistant administered a structured survey
comprised of closed-ended questions to collect data on
sociodemographic characteristics, reproducti ve and antenatal
care history , and mobile phone ownership and use. Data were
collected electronically using the Qualtrics (Provo, UT) survey
platform installed on tablet devices.
Data were imported into the Stata version 16 (StataCorp, Colle ge
Station, TX) statistical softw are for analysis. Descripti ve
summaries (means, standard deviations, and percentages) were
calculated for relevant survey responses and are presented
below. Differences between rural and urban women were
evaluated using the 2-tailed Student’ s ttest for continuous
variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Results
A total of 406 pregnant women were enrolled in the study . Table
1summarizes their demographic characteristics, and Table 2
details their mobile phone ownership and use. Enrolled women
were 28 years of age, on average. A majority of the women
were married, had at least standard 7 schooling, and were either
emplo yed or self-emplo yed. Education and emplo yment
distrib utions differed between rural and urban women. A
majority of women had started their antenatal care in the second
trimester and most had previously given birth.

cTSH: Tanzanian shillings.
Only 3 women, all residing in rural areas, had never used a
mobile phone. However, rural women reported more frequent
mobile phone use than urban women. Most women either owned
a mobile phone or could access one through family members
including the father of the child to be born. Notably , fewer rural
women reported being sole owners of phones compared to urban
women. Similar percentages of urban and rural women reported
using phones for making phone calls. However, compared to
urban women, fewer rural women reported being able to
communicate via text messaging and transact mobile mone y.
Fewer than 10% of both urban and rural women reported using
social media or the internet on phones.
Most urban and rural women said that important messages
delivered to a mobile phone would reach them the same day.
Problems related to phone charging and netw ork connecti vity
were reported to be infrequent (less than once per week) by a
majority of the women. Most women reported spending
500-2000 Tanzanian shillings (TSH; US $1 corresponded to
approximately 2200 TSH at the time of the study) per week on
phone-related charges.
Discussion
Study findings suggest high mobile phone access among
pregnant women in the Mtw ara region. Our data suggests the
feasibility of text- or voice-based interv entions delivered via
mobile phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of
southern Tanzania, but there was less readiness for
smartphone-based interv entions or strate gies relying on the use
of social media or the internet. High rates of mobile phone use
for financial transactions (sending or recei ving mone y) and the
widespread use of bundles, both of which require menu-based
interactions with phones, suggest that Unstructured
Supplementary Service Data (USSD) assessments or
interv entions may be feasible. Potential applications could
include short questionnaires for data collection or monitoring.
Due to observ ed variations in phone access and ownership, it
is likely that any mobile phone–based interv entions will be
delivered to shared phones for some participants. This findingmay be of relevance to studies involving sensiti ve health topics
(eg, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases; intimate partner
violence).
According to our data, the population in the Mtw ara region are
relati vely smartphone-nai ve, compared to some other Tanzanian
cities like Dar-es-Salaam and Arusha, where 4G netw ork
infrastructure has been previously reported [10].
Smartphone-based interv entions may be possible in Mtw ara,
but may require larger financial investments for the provision
of smartphones to participants, as well as higher training needs
to facilitate their use. We did not formally assess whether mobile
netw orks in the Mtw ara region would be able to support broad
use of smartphones.
This study is subject to several limitations. First, only women
who had access to a mobile phone were enrolled for the survey.
Our study , therefore, excludes women from families that do not
have access to a mobile phone. Literature suggests that women
from socioeconomically disadv antaged families are more likely
to lack mobile phone access [10]. Such women may be more
vulnerable and could potentially benef it more from interv entions
promoting health information and health service use. Second,
the selected facilities were within 20 kilometers of Mtw ara, the
urban regional capital and commercial center . Generalizability
of the study findings is limited to the specif ic study area in late
2017, as mobile phone use and ownership characteristics may
vary in other regions and is likely to increase over time. Third,
the study provides only conte xtual information for the design
of interv entions; qualitati ve work concerning end user
perceptions on feasibility and acceptability should complement
the design and implementation of specif ic digital health
interv entions.
In conclusion, study findings suggest high feasibility of text-,
voice-, or USSD-based interv entions delivered via mobile
phones to pregnant women in the Mtw ara region of southern
Tanzania. The use of social media and internet among pregnant
women is limited. Future studies may use this study’ s findings
to track growth in mobile phone ownership and changes in use
patterns among pregnant women in the region.

Abstract  
Purpose : The research was  to establish teachers ' attitud e towards integrating ICT in classroom  
instruction   
Methods:  The study was carried out in secondary schools of the southern region, Eritrea. A 
descriptive survey research design was adopted. The study targeted 27 public secondary schools 
in the region. Str atified random sampling technique was used to get a sample of 12 secondary 
schools from 12 sub-regions. The sample of respondents of the study was drawn from thes e 12 
secondary schools of 12  sub-regions. The respondents were 12 school directors, 34 Biology  
teachers and 175 grade eleven students. Questionnaires, interview and observation schedules 
were used as instruments for data collection. Questionnaire for Biology teachers and students, 
Interview Schedule for school Directors , were employed. Piloting and  consultation were 
conducted to establish validity and reliability before the instruments were used for the actual data 
collection. The data collected included both qualitative and quantitative data. The quantitative 
data were  analyzed using Statistical  Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The qualitative data 
obtained f rom the open -ended questions were  analyzed thematically based on research 
objectives .  
Results:  The study found that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had a 
positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning. They liked to use ICT in their 
Biology lessons; they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting, understandable and 
improves learners' performance   
Unique Contribution to Theory, Practice and P olicy:  The study recommended that Ministry 
of Education should provide adequate in -service training on ICT integration skills for teachers

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
Attitude is one of the teacher 's factor s that affect the use of ICT in the classroom . Having a 
positive attitude is crucial in integrating ICT in education . Muslem, Yusuf and  Juliana (2018)  
conducted a study on attitude and barriers to ICT use amo ng English teachers in Indonesia. The 
study used a questionnaire and interview for 26 teachers selected by purposive sampling 
technique. The finding s of the study show ed that participant teachers had positive perceptions of 
the implementation of ICT in classroom teaching and learning. Teachers believe  that ICT support 
them in their lessons as well as helps them to find information that enriches their lessons easily 
and qu ickly.  They also think that ICT makes teaching in the class more interesting.  
Hong (2016)  carried out a study on teachers’ views of ICT integration using open -ended, semi -
structured interview for 23 teachers from different parts of Colorado, USA. The study revealed 
that teacher s involved in the study had a positive attitude  towards ICT as an instructional tool . 
They liked ICT as a pedagogical tool and as a resource bank for their teaching. Teachers wanted 
to learn new ways of using ICT to deliver instructional materials to stude nts effectively and 
showed their willingness to incorporate ICT in their lessons frequently. This is because they 
believed that ICT is a current trend , and it has many benefits for students. Further, the study 
found that low availability of ICT resources , especially the availability of computers and 
unreliable internet connection were major barriers that limited the implementation of ICT in  the 
classroom.  
Daher,  Baya’a and Anabousy  (2018)  conducted a n experimental study on in -service M athematics 
teachers' integration of ICT as innovative practice in lower secondary  and found out that the 
teachers h ad positive attitudes and  beliefs.  Despite  their positive feeling s, teachers were reluctant 
to integrate technology in their lessons due to their little experience and different obstacles they 
encountered in  the integration of ICT in education.  
According to the study carried out by  Semerci and Aydın ( 2018)  on examining high school 
teachers’ attitudes towards ICT use in education, applying descriptive res earch design and 
questionnaire for 353 teachers working in different schools of Ankara, turkey. Teachers 
displayed a high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low level of anxiety 
towards ICT use in education.  
Adegbenro, Gumbo  and Olakanmi  (2017)  investigated in -service secondary school teachers’ 
technology integration needs i n an ICT enhanced classroom in Pretoria , South Africa using 
Questionnaire and focus group discussion. The  finding of the study revealed that teachers had 
positive attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms. Teachers were willing to learn 
more ab out how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes. However, 
teachers faced difficulties in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their 
inadequate knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices. According to 
Ottestad (2013) , an online survey was done on 247 school leaders , and 386 teachers from 
Norwegian primary and lower secondary  schools  revealed that there was a correlation between 
the attitude and behavio r of school leaders and the a ttitude and behavio r of teachers regarding  
ICT integration in classroom practices.  Journal of Education  and Practice

 A study conducted by Msila (2015)  in South Africa, using an interview to explore the view of 
teachers on digital technology use in instruction. Findings showed that younger teachers were 
more open -minded than the older teachers who found the introduction of  ICT discouraging. In 
the end, the study concluded that the success of digital technology in classrooms depend s more 
on teacher competence as well as positive attitudes towards ICT.  Similarly , a study conducted on  
pre-service Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology teaching revealed  that 
pre-service Biology teachers had a positive attitude with no difference in gender or class  (Yapici 
and Heved anli 2012) . The p resence of a positive attitude in teachers enhances the use of ICT in 
instruction.  However, least was known about Biology teachers’ attitude toward s the  integration 
of ICT in teaching and learn ing in the S outhern Region's secondary schools in Eritrea . 
Statement of the Problem  
The use of technology has influenced all human aspects of life , and it has an impact on how 
education is delivered. The Government of Eritrea , through the Ministry of E duca tion, has placed 
effort in introducing a new curriculum that focuses on learner -centered, outcome -based 
interactive pedagogy. The new curriculum allows learners to actively participate in their 
learning. In addition to this, ICT policy in education has bee n launched for integrating ICT in 
education. While studying B iology is important for it generally helps us to get a  better 
understanding about ourselves , the world and its natural processes, the performance of this 
subject in secondary schools in Eritrea was not satisfactory  in the last five years . The 
performance of Biology , as indicated in table 1.1 , was poor in the last five years. This can have a 
serious implication for the quality of education and discourage students from studying Biology. 
This problem  of low performance could be solved by integrating I CT in teaching and learning of 
Biology.  
Various researches conducted on ICT integration in education have proved that integrating ICT 
in teaching and learning improve s the quality of learning and perform ance of learners. Moreover, 
ICT integration simplifies abstract and complex concepts, create s cooperative learning, and 
create s interest in learning among students . In essence, integration of ICT creates a learner -
centered learning environment. Although the integration of ICT has many benefits that can be 
considered as opportunities, it also has numerous challenges. It demands educational 
transformation such as changing curriculum, assessment , and importantly changing role of 
teachers from being c ustodians of knowledge to being facilitator s in pedagogy.  
The effective integration  of ICT in teaching and learning requires the availability of ICT 
resources, Teachers' preparedness on ICT integration, and attitude of teachers towards ICT 
integration in teaching -learning . However,  it is not clear whether Biology teachers integrate  ICT 
in the classroom instruction  with the purpose of improving teaching and learning of biology . 
This study,  therefore , intended to examine the integration of ICT in teaching and learning  of 
Biology in the Southern R egion of Eritrea . 
2.0 METHODOLOGY  
This study used a descriptive survey research design.  The study took place  in the Southern  
Region Eritrea.  The t arget population for the study comprised 27 public secondary schools of the 
southern region, 27 school directors, 78 Biology teachers and 1664 grade eleven  Biology Journal of Education  and Practice

 students of secondary schools  of the southern region, Eritrea.  In this study, stratified, purposive 
sampling and simple random sampling techniques were used. Stratified  sampling was used to 
determine a sample of 12 schools from 27 public secondary schools.  The school directors of the 
sampled schools were purposively selected to participate in the study.  Simple random sampling 
technique was further applied to obtain Biolo gy teachers and 10.5% of students of grade eleven, 
making 175 students from the sampled school. From the sampled sch ool, three (3) Biology 
teachers, one teacher from the list of teachers who teach grade 9, grade 10 and grade 11 was 
randomly picked to parti cipate in the study . The sample size of the study comprised of 221  
secondary schools, school directors, Biology teachers and students . Three-research instrument s 
were  used for data collection : questionnaire, interview and observation schedule.  The data 
collected include d both qualitative and quantitative data.  The quantitative data collected from the  
sampled secondary schools using teachers' questionnaire, students' questionnaire  interview and 
observation schedule s were organized, cleaned, coded and entered  into a computer program 
Statistical  Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis. The quantitative data were analyzed 
using desc riptive statistics such as mean and percentages . The data were presented in the form of 
tables and figures such as percentag es, bar graphs  and pie charts.

3.1 Demographic Information of  Respondents  
3.1.1 Demographic Information of School Directors  
This section presents the demographic information of the school directors  who participated in the 
study. The demograph ic data explored  in the  study were gender, computer literacy and 
professional experience.  
a) Gender of school directors  
In the study,  12 school directors participated in the interview, and a ll the school directors were 
male s. This shows that in the sampl ed school, there were not female school directors.  
b) Computer training of school directors  
 The findings of the study show that all the school directors were computer trained and could 
able to play a role in  supporting other teachers to use ICT in classr oom teaching in their schools.   
c) Professional experience of the school directors as principals   
The distribution of school directors based on their professional  experience  was as desc ribed in

The sampled school directors had varied professional experience  in the current post  as indicated 
in table 2.  One-third of the directors (33.3  %) had less than  or equal to  five years  of experience, 
41.7% had between 6 and 10 years of experience. Other 16.7 % of the directors had between 11 -
15 years of experience, and 8.3% had between 16 and 20 years of experience. This shows that 
most of the school directors  (75%) had professional experience of less than ten  years.  
4.1.2 Demographic Information of Biology Teachers   
This section presents the demographic information of B iology teachers involved in the study. 
Teachers were the main targets of the study because teachers mainly implement ICT integration. 
The demographic data explored were gender, age, teaching experience, computer literacy , class 
size and workload of teachers.  
a) Gender composition of teachers  
The composition of teachers based on their gender was as presented in figure 1

The finding in figure 1 shows the gender composition of teachers who participated in the study. 
The greater part (70.6%) of the respondents were male teachers, and the remaining (29.4%) were 
female teachers. This shows that both male and female teachers participated in the study . 
b) Age distribution of teachers  
Age distribution of teachers was integrated into the study. The sampled teachers of Biology had 
varied distribution of age , as indicated  in figure 2.

Figure 2. Age distribution of teachers  
Source: Teachers' Questionnaire  
Figure 2 shows 47.1% of the teachers were aged between 20 and 30 years, followed by 26.5% 
aged between 41 and 50 years. Another 23.5% were aged between 31 and 40 years. There was 
only one teacher aged above 50 years in the sampled schools. Majority of the  teachers (70.6%) 
fall in the age range of 20 and 40 years. This shows most teachers that participated  in the study 
were at young were they could easily accept the use of technology in their teaching.  
c) Teachers ' professional experience  
The experience of teachers in their teaching profession was considered in the study. The 
distribution was as presented in table 2.

 teachers  had experience of between 3 and 4 years, and 11 .8% of teachers had the experience of 
between 7 and 8 years. The study  found that the majority of  the participant teachers were novice 
of 1-2 years and above 9 years of experiences. This show s that the  teachers had different  years of 
experiences in teaching .  
d) Computer Literacy of teachers   
The researcher sought information on computer literacy level s among Biology teachers. The 
Findings were as illustrated in Table 3.

Source: Teachers' Questionnaire  
From table 3, out of the 34 teachers of Biology, 91.2% had computer literacy training, while 
8.8% had no computer literacy  training . This shows that majority of  Biology teachers  had 
received computer literacy training,  though the training was not adequate to have compe tency in 
computer.  
e) Teachers ' workload  
The w orkload is the number of periods the teacher teaches in a week. The lowest and highest  
periods  that the teachers had were 15 a nd 32 , respectively. The mean of periods that a teacher 
had was 23 in a week.  If teachers have a heavy workload, it can be a barrier to prepare ICT based 
classroom lessons.  
f)  Class size in B iology classrooms  
Class size is the number of student s in a classroom in a Biology lesson.  From the sampled 
schools, the minimum class size was 46 , and the maximum was 73  students  in a Biology 
classroom . The average number of students per class in the sampled schools was 64. This is too 
large to manage the student s' activity in the  technology -enhanced learner -centered  classroom  
instruction . In large  class size, to use ICT and leaner -centered learning could be a challenge.  
4.1.3 Demographic Information of Students    
This section presents the demographic  information of students  involved in the study. The 
demogr aphic data explored were gender and computer  literacy.  
a) Gender Distribution of Students   
The gender distribution of students involved in the study was as presented in figure 3.

4.2 Teachers Attitude towards Integrating ICT in the Instruction of Biology  
The study sought to establish the attitude  of Biology  teachers towards the integration of ICT in 
teaching and learning  of Biology.  The attit ude of teachers was measured in Likert scale, ranging 
from strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree and strongly disagree in the statements that 
determine the teachers' attitude as illustrated in table 4.

From table  4 majority of Biology , teachers constituting 41.7% strongly agreed and 32.4% agreed 
that teachers of Biology in this school like using ICT in teaching. However , 11.8% of the 
respondents were neutral , while 2.9% of them disagreed, 5.9% of teachers strongly disagreed to 
the statement. Majority of the teachers 61.8% strongly agr eed, and 26.5% of them agreed that 
students understand Biology very well, when ICTs are used, however , 8.8% of the respondents 
were neutral to the statement. All Biology teachers either strongly agreed 82.4% or agreed 17.6% 
that ICT makes teaching and lear ning interesting. The study also showed that  majority (58.8% ) 
of Biology teachers strongly agreed followed by 35.3 % who agreed to the statement ""Integration 
of ICT in Biology lessons improves students' performance in Biology national examinations,"" 
wherea s 5.9% of teachers were neutral. For the statement ""Students in this school like the use of 
ICT in Biology lessons,"" it was indicated that 29.4%, of teaches strongly agreed and 38.2% of 
them agreed together constituting 67.6% while few teachers 11.8% disag reed and strongly 
disagreed. However, 20.6% of teachers were neutral to that.  
Majority of teachers 55.9% strongly agreed , and 35.3% agreed that ICT makes the students to be

of teachers agreed that much content is covered within a short time when ICT is used in Biology 
lessons. However, 11.8% of the teachers responded neutral ly. The few teachers who strongly 
disagreed and disagreed comprise 8.8%.   
In each of th e statement, teachers either agreed or strongly agreed. This shows that majority of 
the teachers had a positive attitude towards the integration of ICT in teaching and learning. 
Findings from other researches revealed that teachers believe that ICT could b e used as a 
pedagogical tool in improving their teaching when there are adequate resources and Journal of Education  and Practice

ICT in education has been seen as an important factor to encourage teachers to use ICT in their 
classroom  (Player -Koro, 2012) . 
In addition to the attitude of teachers,  as the beneficiaries of the ICT integration,  the study also 
looked at  the attitude of students towards the use of ICT in Biology learning. Table 5 shows the 
attitude of students towards the integration of ICT in teaching and learning.

As presented in table4.12 , over 90% of students strongly agreed and agreed  that ICT can help to 
improve students' performance in Biology, few students (3.4%) disagreed, and another few 
students (3.4%) were neutral.  The study found that 25.1% of respondents agreed, 20 % st rongly

respondents were neutral to that, whereas 8.6% the students strongly disagreed and 6.9% of the 
respondents disagreed with the statement.  
For the statement, "" Students easily understand Biology when ICT resources are used"" 51.4% of 
students strongly agreed. They were seconded by 33.1% of students who agreed, however , 
10.9% were neutral. Little percentage (4.6%) of students strongly disagreed and disagreed.   
Majo rity, more than 80% of students strongly agreed and agreed that ICT makes learning

positive attitude towards the use of ICT in biology  learning.  
Majority of the interviewed school directors said that  teachers in their schools had a positive 
attitude towards ICT integration. Teachers like using ICT and believe ICT makes teaching and  
learning more interesting. Few school directors were not able to decide about teachers' attitude.  Journal of Education  and Practice

 One school director was quoted in saying that:  
Without providing ICT resources necessary for teaching and learning  their subject, 
giving them adequate trai ning on how to integrate ICT in  biology teaching and without 
observing them using ICT in their  classrooms, it is not easy to judge about teachers' 
attitude towards ICT  integration in teaching and learning. (School Director No.9, 2018) . 
Based  on the quot ation of the school director, it was difficult to measure teachers' attitude 
towards the integration of ICT in Biology lessons before providing the requirements.  
The school directors were also asked to give their view  on how they see the integration o f ICT in 
teaching and learning. Majority of them believe d ICT would improve the quality of teaching and 
learning. However, few responded that computer and internet could take the attention of students 
away from their Biology learning.  When school directors  have a positive attitude towards ICT 
integration in schools, they can give the necessary support for teachers in using ICT in their 
lessons. Teachers, students and school directors involved in the study showed a  positive attitude 
towards the integration o f ICT in teaching and learning process. The findings of this study were 
in ag reement with several research  studies. A study conducted by  Semerci and Aydın  (2018)  on 
examining high school teachers’ attitudes towards ICT use  in education, applying descriptive 
research design and questionnaire for 353 teachers working in different schools of Ankara, 
turkey. Teachers displayed a high level of positive attitude towards ICT use in education and low 
level of anxiety towards ICT us e in education.  
Hong (201 6) carried out a study on teachers’ views of ICT integration using open -ended, semi -
structured interview for 23 teachers from different parts of Colorado, USA. The study revealed 
that teachers involved in the study had a positive attitude towards ICT as  an instructional tool . A 
study conducted on  pre-service Biology teachers attitude toward the use of ICT in Biology 
teaching, the result revealed that pre -service Biology teachers had a positive attitude with no 
difference in gender or class (Yapici and Hevedanli, 2012) . 
Although a positive attitude towards ICT is one of the factors for the integration of ICT in 
education, having a positive attit ude alone is not enough for ICT integration in teaching and 
learning. Adegbenro, Gumbo  and O lakanmi (2017)   ascertained that teachers had positive 
attitudes towards using computers in their classrooms. Teachers were willing to learn more about 
how to integrate computers in the teaching and learning processes. However, teachers faced 
difficulti es in the implementation of ICT in classroom practices due to their inadequate 
knowledge and lacked skills to use ICT in their pedagogical practices.  
4.0 SUMMARY,  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
4.1 Summary  
In the study, it was revealed that majority of B iology teachers who participated in the study had a 
positive attitude towards the use of ICT in teaching and learning. They liked to use ICT in their 
Biology lessons; they believed ICT makes learning Biology interesting, understandable and 
improves learner s' performance. In addition, the study revealed that the attitude of the majority of  
school directors and students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education.Even though 
a positive attitude existed in the schools' community, ICT was not applied for teaching and Journal of Education  and Practice

 learning of Biology. This could be due to other barriers that influenced ICT integration in 
instruction.  
4.2 Conclusion s 
The study concluded  that majority of Biology teachers who participated in the study had positive 
attitudes towards th e use of ICT in teaching and learning. The attitude of school directors and 
students was also positive towards the use of ICT in education. Though the attitude of teachers 
and school directors was positive, ICT was not integrated into instruction. From thi s, it is logical 
to conclude that having a positive attitude alone could not make ICT integration practical in the 
classrooms.  
4.3 Recommendations  
The study recommended that Ministry of Education should provide adequate in -service training 
on ICT integration skills for teachers

UNESCO-Pearson Initiative for Literacy: Improved Livelihoods in a Digital World2
Summary
Nepal has sustained a continued reduction in maternal and under-5 mortality 
rates, but there are still severe disparities between those of different socio-economic status (Nepal, 2015). In 2014, under-5 mortality rates per 1,000 live births were 1.5 times greater for rural than for urban areas, 2.4 times greater for mothers with low levels of education than for mothers with higher education, and 2.6 times greater for the poorest than for the wealthiest Nepali households (Nepal, 2015).
Following this trend in disparity, in 2014 the chance of receiving a full cycle of 
antenatal care (ANC) was twice as high among the wealthiest households and highest educated mothers than for the poorest and least educated mothers (Nepal, 2015). Also, the ratio of institutional delivery or delivery by a skilled attendant for highly educated mothers was over twice that for mothers with 
no formal education, and for the wealthiest households it was over three times 
greater than for the poorest (Nepal, 2015). Fewer than 20 per cent of all new mothers successfully complete the full cycle of three postnatal check-ups after giving birth (Nepal, 2017).
To address this shortfall, Medic Mobile was launched in Nepal in 2013 as a mobile 
phone-based health monitoring solution using a simple data capture interface appropriate for community health workers (CHWs) with low levels of literacy and technical skills. CHWs conduct home visits and register maternal health information directly to their mobile devices to provide increased coverage of ANC among rural women from poor households and with little formal education. A web-based digital dashboard allows CHW supervisors to monitor CHW activity and schedule follow-up services for those with high-risk pregnancies. Since its launch, the programme has been scaled up in Nepal to over 2,500 CHWs, and has been launched in twenty-two other countries, supporting almost 14,000 CHWs worldwide.  The focus of this case study is the Medic Mobile implementation in Nepal.
Through the UNESCO-Pearson Initiative for Literacy: Improved Livelihoods 
in a Digital World, this case study is part of a series highlighting how inclusive digital solutions can help people with low skills or low literacy levels use technology in ways that support skills development and, ultimately, improve livelihoods – in contribution to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal on education.

1 By traditional literacy is meant the ability to read and write. Why selected
To ensure that the digital solution is as appropriate as possible, Medic 
Mobile has continually focused on a user-centred design approach, undertaking a range of activities such as user interviews and field visits, focus group discussions and role-playing with supervisors and CHWs, stakeholder and process mapping of current activities, paper-prototyping, usability tests, and pre- and post-tests for education and digital skills. The process followed offers an instructive example of good practice when 
designing with users.
Key takeaways
1 /  Medic Mobile offers an accessible mobile health (mHealth) approach 
to support more connected and coordinated health-care systems.
2 /  Medic Mobile recognizes that the process of user-centered design 
requires extensive collaboration with all types of users and key stakeholders.
3 / The Medic Mobile digital solution provides evidence of effective 
mHealth implementation among communities with low traditional1  and 
technical literacy.UNESCO-Pearson Initiative for Literacy: Improved Livelihoods in a Digital World4
Context and project origins
In 1997 the government of Nepal instituted 
the national Safe Motherhood Programme, 
with a primary goal of reducing maternal and 
neonatal mortality (of new-borns up to one month) while improving overall health through preventive practices for antenatal care, delivery 
and the postnatal period (Nepal, 2017). While 
overall maternal and child mortality rates have steadily declined over the past fifteen years, limitations in knowledge about services among 
expectant mothers, institutional coverage, 
and service delivery have created disparities between mothers’ experiences along the lines of 
education, wealth and (rural or urban) location.
In addition to the Safe Motherhood Programme, 
the government added a policy in 2006 
underscoring the importance of skilled birth 
attendance (SBA) at all deliveries through the national deployment of trained professionals. As part of its ongoing commitment to maternal and neonatal health (MNH), Nepal has a goal of 
70 per cent of deliveries by institution or SBA by 
2020 (Nepal, 2017). Some constraints that make achieving this goal difficult include inadequate referral mechanisms for receiving care, low coverage of ANC consultations, and lack of access 
to hospitals and health centres (Nepal, 2017). 
Medic Mobile was developed with these specific constraints in mind.
In 2013, Medic Mobile partnered with the Ministry 
of Health in Nepal and One Heart World Wide
2 to 
equip CHWs who conduct routine house visits for 
expectant mothers with basic mobile phones. The 
health workers receive reminders to follow up with mothers for ANC consultations, delivery procedures and postnatal care (PNC) visits. The primary 
objective of the programme was to increase rates 
of full ANC visits and institutional deliveries among expectant mothers. Medic Mobile’s target audience is the network of almost 60,000 CHWs in Nepal.

organization (NGO) working to strengthen public health services for mothers and children. www.oneheartworld-wide.org.© Medic Mobile/Lewis FeuerCase Study: Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile5

Distribution of CHW pilot sample by educational attainment, 2014Designing with the user 
© Medic Mobile/Lewis FeuerCentral to Medic Mobile’s philosophy and practice 
is following a user-centred design approach, or 
what it calls human-centred design, in partnership 
with CHWs. Prior to pilot implementation, the Medic Mobile team ran two rounds of field tests, creating opportunities for local stakeholders to 
influence system design features. Over 40 percent 
of registered CHWs have no formal schooling (JSI, 2012). Therefore, the Medic Mobile team consciously included key stakeholder feedback from 
communities with low traditional and digital literacy 
as an added measure for ensuring an appropriate mobile health design solution.
Initial design activities included mapping current 
health-care system activities with CHWs and their supervisors to identify constraints and opportunities, 
and validating sketches of the proposed platform 
interface before developing a prototype for field-testing. This process also involved individual interviews with staff at the government agency responsible for all public health programmes in the 
district.
Preliminary design activities led to a pilot 
implementation among seventy-seven CHWs and 
twenty-one supervisors in the Baglung District 
of Nepal. The purpose of the pilot was to test the feasibility of the platform among the sample of CHWs and to solicit feedback for improving its overall usability design. The pilot CHWs ranged in age from 20 to 71, with an average age of about 40. 
The sample for the pilot reflected the educational 
and ethnic distribution in the district (Figure 1).
Almost a third of the sample had no formal 
education and limited reading and writing proficiency, while 12 per cent of the sample 
had higher secondary education or above. The 
CHWs had between none and twenty-one years’ experience of community health work, with an 
average of 12.7 years. The pilot implementation 
stage resulted in critical shifts in the programme objectives and strategies concerning the system’s core technologies.
UNESCO-Pearson Initiative for Literacy: Improved Livelihoods in a Digital World6
Prior to field-testing, stakeholder groups were divided about 
the type of content to include in the CHW reporting system. 
Given that the tool was developed to improve ANC coverage, 
the field-testing revealed some clear areas that could be cut. Protocol items specific to health facility services that could not accurately be substantiated by self-reports at home 
(such as iron tablets given, and tetanus and diphtheria (TD) 
vaccination administered) were removed from the updated version. The resulting protocol was not only easier for CHWs to administer, but more focused on the intended purpose of the 
design solution.LESSON
 
Focus on the 
content the digital 
tool was designed 
to addressHealth worker motivation. A 
major insight from the focus group sessions was that there was low motivation among CHWs because of a 
perceived sense of isolation from supervisors, and lack of support for their work (Sharma and Holeman, 2017). The group solicited for feedback indicated that the idea 
of linking their efforts to a larger system and receiving 
confirmation was appealing. Medic Mobile used this feedback to incorporate a personalized and automated SMS confirmation each time a report was submitted as a 
means of increasing the visibility of, and acknowledging, 
the CHWs in the health system. The pilot validated the fact that the automated response including a warm greeting 
and salutation using the CHW’s name was better received 
than a generic confirmation. Therefore, Medic Mobile carried this feature over into subsequent iterations of the platform.
Continuous adaptation. An early 
design of the Medic Mobile system included a reporting 
feature for flagging high-risk pregnancies in birthing 
centres. The pilot revealed that CHWs preferred making phone calls to ask for assistance with emergency issues, while they preferred the SMS system for non-emergencies 
and as a useful backup in low-network-coverage areas 
(Sharma and Holeman, 2017). Medic Mobile used this insight to redesign the workflow to allow CHWs to submit the reports after making an initial phone call. This 
underscores the importance of continuous feedback for a 
sustained user-design process.Validation and shifts in programme objectives

Right-sizing the reporting 
system. During the initial field-testing 
process, stakeholder groups debated how much 
information the CHWs should submit through 
the reporting system, with some groups pushing for a more comprehensive reporting protocol. The pilot revealed important insights into what it 
was feasible for CHWs to achieve on the ground. 
Informed by the pilot outcomes, stakeholder groups were able to agree on a more limited set of essential data, and prioritize the primary 
objectives of the reporting system (Sharma and 
Holeman, 2017)Expanding the role of the 
target group.  The pilot implementation 
revealed a need to expand the target group of 
end users. The original design included a web-
based dashboard system for displaying reports and CHW activity, but many CHW supervisors did not have computers and relied on SMS alerts 
from CHWs. The pilot showed the importance of 
their role for scaling up, and made it clear that the community supervisors needed more information to support CHWs. This insight has led to 
modifications in the roles of the CHW supervisors 
and their information needs.

Feature phones and SIM card 
apps. The initial design of the Medic Mobile 
approach incorporated low-cost feature phones and 
SIM card apps. Compared with smartphone devices, 
feature phones were both more cost-effective to the programme and more familiar to CHWs. Also, CHWs often used SMS for communication in their 
daily lives, and feature phones were more reliable in 
environments with low internet connectivity. Pre-pilot stakeholder interviews called for a comprehensive digitization of the entire MNH protocol. Therefore, the 
team developed a SIM-based app for data collection 
and storage of report protocol. The app resided on the SIM card and ran on the phone. As a comprehensive 
reporting system, SIM app technology was attractive 
for its ability to support menu-driven forms to help mediate responses and ensure accurate data entry. The pilot experience led to three important findings 
regarding the initial design solution:
1   There was a need to validate CHWs’ ability to use 
the feature phone comfortably and adopt the 
SMS design approach. However, the menu-driven 
platform of the prototype presented a challenge 
because of its more technically complicated, multi-step interface.
2   It was necessary to expand the training module 
to include a comprehensive digital literacy component, covering the basic alphabets on the keypad and general operation of the 
feature phones. This needed to be offered prior 
to orienting the CHWs to the more advanced features of the Medic Mobile platform.
3   There was also a need to arrive at a consensus 
for streamlining the data capture process, as described above. Through this pilot experience, Medic Mobile began to explore other SMS-based tools that did not involve a menu-driven platform, and simplified the 
data collection protocol.
Improving the efficiency of the technology

natively on any feature phone
Text forms collect small amounts of structured data using 
ordinary SMS. To submit a text form, a CHW sends an 
ordinary SMS message with values delineated by spaces. A 
CHW might send a text message with content such as ‘P 8 Pabitra’ , where ‘P’ indicates registering a new pregnancy, ‘8’ the number of weeks pregnant, followed by the patient’s 
name. In Nepal, text forms came to be seen as a viable 
option after insight was gained from a SIM-based pilot trial.INSIGHT
 
Co-designing  
for improved 
usabilityData entry with text forms. 
Medic Mobile decided to test the use of web-based text forms that allowed CHWs to enter 
space-delineated lines of text to register data, 
instead of the multi-step menu approach of the SIM app used during the pilot. This switch reduced the number of key strokes needed to send an 
updated report. While SMS-based text forms – 
essentially structured SMS messages – have proved effective in similar studies for maternal health in Rwanda (Ngabo et al., 2012) and family planning in 
Malawi (Vollmer Lemay et al., 2012), stakeholders at 
pre-pilot design workshops were sceptical of this approach based on concerns related to data entry 
© Medic MobileCase Study: Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile9
and poor adoption among CHWs used to the traditional 
paper-based system.
Prioritizing the reporting items captured and streamlining 
the protocol allowed the team to revisit the topic of alternatives to SIM card apps. Further research revealed 
that text forms have two key usability advantages over 
SIM card apps. They reduce hardware procurement costs and improve routine software updates as an alternative to convening CHWs and updating cards one at a time. CHWs 
also reported that communicating through SMS offered 
a more comfortable reporting technique and reduced overall reporting time as opposed to navigating through the menu-driven interface of a SIM app.
Enhanced information for CHW 
supervisors. Medic Mobile discovered that if it 
was to promote the use of the system by CHW supervisors 
for monitoring and supporting CHW engagement, the 
supervisors needed access to more information right 
on their phones. Focus group sessions with supervisors revealed that their priority data need was to verify that all expectant mothers were being registered. Therefore, 
Medic Mobile updated the automated SMS schedules to alert CHW supervisors each time a new pregnancy was registered. The alert was 
accompanied by a comprehensive report of delivery information related to the 
expectant mother, including anticipated 
delivery date, the assigned CHW and upcoming ANC consultations. The supervisor could then integrate the Medic 
Mobile Unique ID with the mothers’ official 
MNH register at the local clinic, and easily account for any discrepancies between the two systems.
Design challenge 
Typing text even in the native language (Nepali) is difficult; CHWs were much more 
comfortable with structured alphanumeric digits.
Responses
 ●All Medic Mobile text forms are structured and require as little text as possible. 
Some examples of forms are: ‘P 12 Rita’ , ‘V 12345’ , ‘F 12345’ , ‘D 12345 H 1’ . 
 ●The date field was also replaced with number of days since last menstrual period (LMP). This change allowed CHWs to type one- or two-digit entries instead of the full date format. Example: Weeks since LMP (12) instead of Date of LMP 
(19/02/2017).
Design challenge 
Remembering simple form syntax can be a challenge. 
Responses
 ●All text forms are very short and simple, with a maximum number of four fields 
required: a) pregnancy status, b) number of weeks pregnant, c) mother’s first 
name, d) additional data point.
 ●Medic Mobile form codes are relatable to the action being performed so that they are easy to remember. All error responses and reminders contain the exact 
syntax of the text form that needs to be sent so that CHWs only need to refer to 
these messages to know what to send and when. INSIGHT

The digital solution
Remote registration. Once an expectant mother is identified, the CHW 
registers her information via SMS text form. Medic Mobile’s web application then registers 
the pregnancy, creates a unique patient ID, calculates the expected date of delivery and 
schedules a series of automated reminder messages to the CHW related to ANC and anticipated delivery date.
Antenatal care reminders and advice.  The reminders 
system is scheduled based on the Nepali Ministry of Health’s protocol for recommended ANC visits. SMS alerts are automatically sent to CHWs for follow-up with the expectant mother 
throughout her pregnancy. During the consultation, the CHW provides counselling and 
antenatal education following the adapted government protocols, and reminds the pregnant woman to attend the nearest health facility for an ANC visit. CHWs follow up a few days later to confirm whether the pregnant woman completed her ANC visit at the health facility. If the 
woman has completed her visit, the CHW sends a confirmation SMS text form to the Medic 
Mobile application. If the CHW does not send a confirmation SMS within two weeks of the first ANC reminder, her supervisor is alerted for follow-up.
Emergency forms and birth reports. The platform also 
incorporates a system for supervisors to flag pregnancies with danger signs so that these 
women are more closely supported by the CHWs. Alternatively, if a CHW identifies a danger 
sign during pregnancy, birth or postnatal period, she notifies a professional health-care provider by directly calling them or sending an emergency SMS to the Medic Mobile platform, which then immediately sends out SMS alerts to multiple clinic personnel. After the 
woman gives birth, the CHW confirms her delivery and whether the delivery was performed 
a) at home without a trained health worker, b) at home with a trained health worker, or c) at a health facility certified to provide basic obstetric care services.
Web application and analytics dashboard.  The text 
forms are integrated with the Medic Mobile web application and analytics dashboard, which 
can be translated into local Nepali languages. All the information sent and received by CHWs 
in the form of SMS messages is listed via a web-based application. The analytics dashboard displays preconfigured data reports addressing the CHW supervisor’s needs. The web-based application and the analytics dashboard are monitored by public health administrators at the 
district level.1

4The Medic Mobile digital solution consists of structured SMS messages submitted by CHWs to a web-
based application for registering expectant mothers. An automated reminder system and reporting 
dashboard supports the accountability between expectant mothers, CHWs and their supervisors. The 
system integrates digitized information from the official MNH register to improve institutional and SBA deliveries as well as ANC coverage for expectant mothers.Case Study: Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile11
DigComp2.1: The Digital Competence Framework for Citizens  
(Carretero et al., 2017), developed by the European Commission, 
provides a common reference on how to describe key areas of 
digital competence and proficiency levels among individuals. 
UNESCO has applied this framework to understand the minimum skills needed to use Medic Mobile as well as thirty-one other digital solutions. Benchmarking digital competences 
is recommended because it provides a knowledge base from 
which to design appropriate solutions as well as to track progress of skills development. Please refer to the forthcoming UNESCO landscape review Digital Inclusion for Low-skilled and Low-literate

During all Medic Mobile trainings, more time is 
spent on case-based exercises than on lectures 
or presentations. Trainees are paired in groups 
based on their technical competency levels and proximity of catchment area so they can continue to support each other if they have any difficulties 
after returning to their communities. Each 
training has a maximum of twenty participants, and there are at least two trainers per session. The initial training spans three days, and begins 
with a baseline questionnaire and pre-test of 
digital competencies. At the end of the training, participants complete a competency post-test to ensure they have the minimum skills needed to operate the Medic Mobile platform independently 
in their communities. After the training, CHWs 
receive an a comprehensive, illustrated user manual demonstrating basic concepts of mobile phone use such as sending and receiving messages and other 
relevant functions (Figure 6). In addition to the 
initial training, CHW supervisors convene monthly meetings to gather CHW feedback and provide continuing training and support. Every three to six 
months a more comprehensive refresher training is 
scheduled with all CHWs.Figure 5. Example of Medic Mobile

Monitoring and evaluation strategy
Medic Mobile believes that coordination 
between CHWs and clinics will lead to 
stronger adherence to a full cycle of 
ANC visits and facility-based deliveries, reducing maternal and neonatal mortality. The platform’s analytics dashboard is 
designed to provide real-time data to help 
users spot trends and improve support across the rural health-care system. The Medic Mobile dashboard reports on CHW 
user activity and engagement metrics 
alongside programme outcome metrics. Supervisors use the data to follow up with 
CHWs through phone calls or scheduled 
monitoring visits. Complementing dashboard data with user feedback and field-based observations is an important 
part of support visits. User feedback 
informs not only programmatic revisions but also improvements to the efficiency of the technology.
As part of its monitoring strategy, Medic 
Mobile runs a structured baseline and endline questionnaire  for each training session to ensure participants have 
learned the skills that they require to 
make effective use of the digital platform. As noted earlier, many CHWs are not fully 
confident in their digital skills, so the 
Medic Mobile implementation modality and training curriculum incorporates additional support for CHWs requiring 
additional guidance. For example, CHW 
supervisors schedule more frequent follow-ups with these CHWs, or they are paired with a neighbouring CHW who 
is available to serve as a peer mentor. 
Monthly meetings and reviews are held 
with all CHWs.

Data from a recent CHW intake training reinforces the 
need for digital skills training for mobile phone use prior to 
jumping into the Medic Mobile activities. Survey responses 
from 500 CHWs serving more than thirty communities reveal overall fluency with basic or routine functions such as switching on the device and checking the airtime balance. 
However, respondents indicated less familiarity with more 
advanced SMS features which are critical for Medic Mobile administration.INSIGHT

specific guidelines based on country and partner mandates. During the planning phase of 
each project, data security and confidentiality agreements are strictly defined and signed by 
all CHWs.
Many CHWs are learning to use mobile phones for the first time. The Medic Mobile training approach pairs 
high-literacy and low-literacy CHWs to support people 
with lower skills. Qualitative reports suggest that this has improved literacy for some low-literacy CHWs, not only in reading and writing but in basic fluency with important 
communication tools.FINDING

Results to date
Figure 9. Endline gain scores from training 500 CHWs, 2017
Preliminary evaluation findings from the pilot 
implementation revealed that users believe the mobile 
application made the CHWs' work easier as they do not have 
to keep constant track manually of the timing for scheduled visits. Given the number of expectant mothers CHWs support monthly, it can be easy to lose track of paper registers. CHWs 
remind pregnant women about recommended clinic visits 
every three, six, eight and nine months. The CHWs may do actual home visits to the pregnant women more often. The reminders help them keep track of the visits.FINDING
 
Medic Mobile 
improves service 
deliveryPilot results.  One year since full deployment of 
the pilot in 2015, seventy-seven CHWs from four villages 
across Baglung District had used the SIM application to 
register 604 pregnant women and 215 births, almost two-thirds (64 per cent) of which were at official birthing centres (Medic Mobile, 2015).
During a series of focus group discussions held as 
a part of the interim qualitative evaluation of the 
programme, the CHWs stated that Medic Mobile’s tools 
had increased the frequency of contact with mothers and newborns, increased routine home visits to provide health services to pregnant women and new mothers, 
achieved timely management of complicated cases, and 
created a sense of achievement provided by immediate acknowledgement of their work (Medic Mobile, 2015). 
In addition to achieving broad adoption of the Medic 
Mobile communication system, the pilot showed that a low-bandwidth mHealth system can reliably organize and automate SMS messages for improved adherence to the prescribed ANC schedule.
CHW digital skills. Post-test results 
from a training conducted with 500 CHWs 
across thirty-two communities revealed the 
strongest overall gains in the more complex mobile phone operations that CHWs initially struggled with most (Figure 9). There were 
40–45 per cent gains in the ability to use SMS 
functions including retrieving specific SMSs and accessing the phones inbox.
Scale-up efforts.  In terms of Medic 
Mobile’s activity metrics, the follow-on to the 
pilot deployment has seen an average CHW 
engagement rate of 60 per cent across Baglung district, which is above the internal programme target for monthly ANC coverage. This engagement rate represents the proportion of 
the 950 trained CHWs using the Medic Mobile 
platform to send at least one ANC report per month. So far, in Baglung itself a total of 6,920 pregnant women have been registered, with 
13,567 confirmed ANC visits and 4,989 deliveries 
confirmed.

Sustainability and future plans
Medic Mobile supports a growing network of 
implementing partners running community health 
programmes and building new models for CHW 
programmes. The platform is also well positioned to achieve government adoption of the approach and analytics tools due to positive uptake by county 
health management teams in Kenya and district 
health offices in Nepal. Globally, Medic Mobile is deployed across twenty-three countries supporting almost 14,000 health workers.
In Nepal, the programme has expanded to three 
additional districts outside of Baglung, reaching over 2,700 CHWs supported by 200 health facilities. 
In 2018 the programme will be expanding to ten 
further districts in Nepal, with a cumulative reach of 7,000 CHWs.
Some of the districts in Nepal will be using the Medic 
Mobile tools to track immunizations as well. This 
intervention has the potential to reach more than  1 million Nepali women and children in low-income 
and under-served communities, every year.
Medic Mobile aims to scale its model nationally in 
Nepal, with support from the national government and local buy-in and ownership from the district health office. In the medium term, local and district 
governments have expressed a willingness to 
cover ongoing costs. In the long term, recurring costs could be sustained through a combination 
of local, district and national support, along with 
public–private partnerships. Although Medic Mobile will provide targeted support to initial districts replicating the deployment through 2017, the team envisions government staff deploying and managing these systems starting in 2018.
The Baglung intervention serves as a valuable 
example of how local resources can support sustained funding. Recently, local leaders in the 
community have allocated funds to cover the SMS 
costs and the cost of monthly incentives for CHWs. To date, about US$13,400 has been allocated from fifty-nine villages. This is a unique cost-sharing model 
Medic Mobile has implemented with local-level 
administrative bodies, and is hoping to replicate this model at higher levels of administration.
The cost of deployment per CHW is estimated at 
US$150–200 in the first year and US$10–15 each 
subsequent year. Costs associated with this estimate 
include technical assistance and training support, with hardware and software costs decreasing every 
year.
Medic Mobile is experimenting with direct ways to 
incorporate new features and workflows to influence the end users. One feature incorporates routine SMS 
educational messages to help CHWs review their 
skills, and mechanisms to ensure targeted support from their supervisors. This complementary feature to the training is intended to sustain learning on the 
part of the users as well as ensure that the lower-
skilled CHWs are receiving additional and continuous support. An evaluation of the effectiveness of this 
SMS skills support approach will be aligned with the 
initial CHW trainings, and will commence at the end of 2017.
IMPACT
Medic Mobile 
improves digital 
literacy skills53-year-old Sabitri Pun has been a CHW in Baglung for fifteen years. Until very recently, she had never used a mobile phone. During the three-day 
Medic Mobile training, she learned to power on and power off her mobile 
phone, to dial and save phone numbers, to compose structured SMS messages to register pregnancies and report on ANC visits of expectant mothers. Not only has learning to operate a mobile phone made it easier 
for her to monitor the health of pregnant women in her community, she 
reports that she is now comfortable using the device to communicate with her family and extended network of relatives.Case Study: Medic Mobile by Medic Mobile17
Lessons learned and recommendations
Support scientific knowledge 
while respecting cultural beliefs. 
In rural Nepal, traditional beliefs 
sometimes come into tension with efforts to ensure 
that women give birth in health facilities with skilled 
attendants. As trusted community members, CHWs are uniquely placed to introduce biomedical knowledge in ways that respect local practices and cultural beliefs. 
Therefore, supporting CHWs is vital to improving 
health literacy in ways that reflect local priorities.
User-centred design requires 
collaboration.  A rigorous, user-centred 
design process involves putting people first 
and revising throughout every stage of design, 
implementation and scale-up. This requires tight cooperation between several teams: CHWs and partners at the Ministry of Health, Medic Mobile’s project managers and regional designer, and Medic 
Mobile’s globally distributed product managers 
and software developers. Medic Mobile uses a combination of user-centred design and agile development methods. Experimenting with and 
documenting these methods is a priority for Medic 
Mobile’s research group because they see it as an important way of making their design process more 
consistent and rigorous.
Leveraging expertise within the 
user base. One of the primary challenges for 
Medic Mobile implementation has been the traditional 
and digital literacy capacity of the CHWs when 
working with mobile phone and SMS messaging. The team addressed this reality in part by pairing CHWs with weaker literacy skills and peers with stronger skills through a mentor model.Leverage policy agendas 
for sustainable solutions. 
At the policy level, securing support for the 
implementation of mHealth interventions is a 
major challenge. Medic Mobile’s success working 
alongside communities not only helps clarify their implementation needs, but improves the sustainability of effective mHealth solutions by 
informing government policy through evidence.
Scalability does not always 
require iteration with the same technology. 
When pilot 
outcomes do not result in scaling up a 
prototype technology, it does not imply that 
the technology did not play a role in the scaling process. In the case of Nepal, the initial SIM card app played a key role in building a consensus among stakeholders on prioritizing 
data collection needs. Tools that are appropriate 
at pilot stage may be less appropriate when applied at a larger scale, and vice versa. Results of co-design sessions and experimental trials 
of small pilots should be contextualized as 
waypoints on the journey to a more connected, coordinated delivery system.UNESCO-Pearson Initiative for Literacy: Improved Livelihoods in a Digital World18

DigitalLiteracy,9025.txt,"1 The Gender Labor Market Gap in the Digital Economy
Monserrat Bustelo Luca Flabbi  Mariana Viollaz 
October, 2019 
Abstract 
Recent years have seen an ever-greater expansion of the digital economy , a development that 
may bring new opportunities to workers who were at a disadvantage in the traditional 
economy. We focus on a specific set of workers who belong to such a group: women. We 
study a skill set of particular relevance in the digital economy and estimate their returns in the 
labor market, according to gender, across four Latin American countries. We find that 
information and communication technologies (ICT) skills and science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills yield significant positive returns for both men 
and women. However, there is a significant gender gap that favors men on the STEM returns. 
There is also a sizable gender gap regarding the amount of skills accumulated by gender. 
Through an Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, we estimate that up to 80% of the gender gap in 
hourly wages may be due to the lower returns that women receive, relative to men, on their 
STEM skills. If an investment in skills relevant to the digital economy may be beneficial for 
the labor market performance of both men and women, why returns to STEM exhibit such 
strong gender asymmetries remains an open and relevant question.

1.1 Motivation
Recent years have seen major changes in global labor markets. Technical innovation is leading to 
-greater expansion of a digital economy , in 
which old jobs are lost, new jobs are created, and even the same jobs are approached differently 
and require different competences. If old jobs are lost but new ones are created, then new 
opportunities may arise for workers who were previously at a disadvantage in the traditional 
economy.1 
In this paper, we focus on a specific set of workers who belong to such a group: women. Gender 
gaps in the labor market have been a significant and persistent empirical regularity in most 
countries around the world (Blau and Kahn, 2017). The digital economy affects this longstanding 
gap and may act to reduce or magnify it, depending on the skills that men and women can acquire 
and deliver in the labor market. Focusing on a set of high-income countries, OECD (2018a) finds 
that differences in skill endowments between male and female workers account for some but not 
all of the wage gap. When controlling for skills relevant to the digital economy, the gender wage 
gap is reduced by 1 to 12 percentage points.2OECD (2018b) also shows evidence of gender gaps 
in skills, tracing some back to human capital acquisition during the schooling years. However, 
among recent generations, the study finds that the gender gap in skills relevant to the digital 
economy is more ambiguous: In some areas, girls outperform boys (e.g., collaborative problem 
solving) but are outperformed by boys in others (e.g., digital-related skills). 
Our report focuses on Latin American countries where no systematic analysis of the interaction 
between the digital economy and the gender gap has been undertaken.3The primary reason for the 
1 A number of reports by multilateral organizations and international think-tanks are making a similar point: for the 
OECD, see OECD (2018a; 2018b); for the World Bank, see Box 2.10 in World Bank (2016); for the ILO, see Ryder 
(2018); for the WEF, see World Economic Forum (2018); for the IDB, see Busso et al. (2017). 
2 See Section 1.3 in OECD (2018a). The highest reduction is for Japan, which has the highest gender wage gap among 
OECD countries at about 40%. 
3 Some country reports are starting to look at gender differences in skill acquisition, but without relating the results to 
gender differentials in the labor market. See, for example, OECD (2016) on Chile. The report  using PIAAC data   
3 
 absence of systematic contributions across Latin America relates to data limitations: 
Representative individual-level data, capable of capturing the skills required in the digital 
economy, are scarce. We are taking a first step in this analysis by using data sets comprising this 
relevant information for four Latin American countries: Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, and El Salvador. 
We have obtained the relevant information by combining two different surveys that collected data 
on skills: the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies  (PIAAC) survey, 
available for Chile in 2014, and the Skills Towards Employment and Productivity  (STEP) survey, 
available for Colombia and Bolivia in 2012 and for El Salvador in 2013.  
After extracting the estimation sample, we document gender gaps in skills endowments and 
estimate returns to skills. We control for a variety of factors, including heterogeneous returns by 
with respect to the endogenous selection of women in the labor market. Finally, we decompose 
the gender gap in the portion resulting from differences in returns to skills and differences in skill 
endowments. 
Two specific skills yield significant returns across the board: STEM ( science, technology, 
engineering, and math ) and ICT ( information and communication technologies ). ICT returns are 
similar across genders, with an increase of one standard deviation in the skill generating a return 
in hourly wages of about 17%. By contrast, STEM returns differ significantly between genders, 
with an increase of one standard deviation generating a 15% return for men and a 9% return for 
women. Results by country show some differences in magnitudes. Returns to STEM are higher 
than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia, Colombia, and El Salvador. 
We also estimate that higher levels of education imply significantly higher returns for men but not 
for women. The estimates indicate that STEM endowments and returns play an important role in 
explaining the aggregate gender gap in hourly wages; the lower endowments for women may be 
responsible for up to 30% of the gap, while the lower returns for women may account for close to 
80%. 
 
 
, on study skill formation in the Latin American and the 
Caribbean region, provided evidence on the availability and adoption of digital technologies but not on their relation 
to the gender gap.

 1.2 Structure 
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the data and the specific indicators we build 
to describe the digital economy. Section 3 provides standard descriptive statistics on the gender 
gaps in the labor market, integrating gaps in skills relevant to the digital economy. Section 4 
provides estimates of the returns to these skills, according to gender. The estimates control for a 
rich set of individual characteristics and, in some specifications, for selection in the labor market. 
We also provide evidence regarding the interaction of the skills with the sectors most exposed to 
the digital economy, as well as with education levels. Section 5 focuses on the gender gap in hourly 
wages and unpacks the extent to which the gap can be accounted for by differences in returns, 
relative to differences in the endowment of digital-economy-relevant skills. Section 6 provides 
final comments and a summary of the results. Appendix A includes details about the construction 
of the variables of interest, Appendix B presents the complete regression results, and Appendix C 
provides results according to country. A Web Appendix includes additional specifications and 
robustness checks. 
 
2 Data 
We combine information from two surveys that collected data on skills at work. First, we use 
information accessible in the  PIAAC survey, available for Chile in 2014. The PIAAC is a survey 
-
processing skills  literacy, numeracy, and problem solving  and gathers data on how adults use 
their skills at work. The survey is implemented by an international consortium, contracted by the 
OECD, and is designed to ensure international comparability of the data. Second, we use 
information from the STEP survey, available for Colombia and Bolivia in 2012 and El Salvador 
in 2013. STEP is a survey collected by the World Bank and gathers data on skills in urban areas 
of low- and middle-income countries. It also shares the main objectives and structure of the PIAAC 
questionnaire. It strives to record the data in a way that renders it comparable across different 
countries. 
Still, two concerns remain regarding the comparability of STEP and PIAAC for our purposes. The 
first relates to differences in sampling: STEP is representative of people aged 15-64, living in urban  
5 
 areas, while PIAAC is representative of people aged 16-65, living in both urban and rural areas. 
represented more heavily in non-urban areas: agriculture, forestry and fishery, as well as mining 
and quarrying.4 Due to the slightly disparate age range between the two surveys, we include 
individuals aged 16-64 in the estimation sample. We also restrict the sample to wage employees 
of the private sector, except for El Salvador, where it is not possible to distinguish between the 
private and public sector. These restrictions generate a final estimation sample with 1,541 
observation for Chile, 510 for Bolivia, 668 for Colombia, and 522 for El Salvador. 
The second relates to differences in survey questions. PIAAC and STEP use different 
questionnaires to collect information. Still, the questions about labor market outcomes, 
demographic characteristics, socioeconomic variables, and ability measures generate variables that 
allow for a high degree of comparability between the surveys. The differences in survey questions 
become more relevant when crafting measures of skills, as eliciting skills is a more difficult, and 
arguably less agreed upon, task than eliciting demographic characteristics or standard labor market 
outc
devote the next section of the paper to describing how we build the relevant skills measures from 
parability across countries and 
surveys. 
Throughout the paper, the unit of observation of the data remains the individual worker. The level 
of analysis operates at both the country level and the aggregate level, pooling all countries into a 
single data set. Typically, we discuss the results from the pooled sample in the main text of the 
paper and report country-level results in the Web Appendix. 
 
 
4 We could not limit our direct focus to the urban population in Chile because PIAAC does not report an indicator for 
urban and rural areas. The only geographic indicator reported by PIAAC is the OECD territorial level 2 region, which, 
for Chile, corresponds to 11 of the 15 regions of the country. We have combined this information with the rural/urban 
indicator contained in a nationally representative household survey for Chile  the 2013 CASEN survey. Based on 
CASEN, we can calculate the proportion of the population in each region living in urban areas. Results show that most 
of the population in each Chilean region is concentrated in urban centers. In most of the regions, more than 90% of 
the population lives in urban areas, with the most rural region (Maule) reporting 67% of urban population. Still, we 
have performed a robustness exercise, where we eliminated regions with less than 85% or 75% of the population living 
in urban areas. Our results were barely affected.

 2.1 Skills measures 
We build the skills measures to summarize the information collected in the numerous relevant 
survey questions and in order to maximize the comparability with previous literature and across 
countries. We focus on skills relevant in the digital economy. The previous literature has identified 
ICT and STEM quantitative skills as critical to thriving in the digital era (OECD, 2018a; OECD, 
2018b). It has also argued that soft, social, and interpersonal skills, jointly with creativity and 
critical thinking, will become critical in future, innovative labor markets (Ryder, 2018; World 
Economic Forum, 2018; OECD, 2018b). To capture both sets of competencies, we follow the 
classification proposed by Grundke et al. (2017) in preparatory work for a series of OECD reports 
on skills and the digital economy.5They define the following six sets of skills using data from the 
PIAAC survey on OECD countries: 
1. ICT skills are those related to ICT use, from reading and writing emails to using Word and 
Excel or a programming language. 
2. Managerial and communication skills  capture strategic management abilities for the 
generation of sustainable competitive advantages, including human resource management 
practices, which encompassnegotiating with people, instructing, advising, and persuading people. 
3. Readiness to learn and creative problem-solving skills  include the ability to solve problems 
in the process of developing organizational capabilities and improving firm performance. 
4. Self-organization skills  t to changes and absorb shocks. 
5. Marketing and accounting skills  include abilities associated with accounting tasks, such as 
reading financial invoices and bills, and with front-of-office marketing tasks, such as interacting 
with clients.
6. STEM quantitative skills  include the ability to apply algebra, simple or complex, and 
prepare charts and tables. 
In Table A1 in Appendix A, we provide details on the exact questions from PIAAC and STEP that 
we use to generate each skill measure and the metric associated with each variable. Variables from 
 
5 See OECD (2018a, 2018b). 
  
7 
 PIAAC derive exactly from the definition proposed by Grundke et al. (2017): We construct the 
same set of measures using the PIAAC for Chile as they did using the PIAAC on the 31 OECD 
countries in their analysis.6 In the STEP surveys for Bolivia, Colombia, and El Salvador, we 
identify the questions aimed at capturing the same skills and that are as close as possible to those 
available in PIAAC.  
The first important difference between the two surveys is that most variables in PIAAC capture 
the , 
while STEP involves a combination of binary questions (whether a person performs a certain task 
at work or not) with some categorical frequency questions as in PIAAC. In order to overcome 
these differences between surveys, we construct the skill measures applying a standardization 
methodology used by previous studies (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011; Almeida et al., 2018). First, 
for each variable associated to a skill category, we calculate the mean and standard deviation and 
standardize the variable by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Second, 
for each worker in the sample, we obtain a score for each skill category by adding all the 
standardized variables obtained in the first step. Third, for all skill measures to have a zero mean 
and standard deviation of one, we do one additional standardization of the six skill categories by 
subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation. The standardization is performed 
for each country separately. 
The second important difference concerns the difference in the actual questions. Many important 
questions are extremely similar, for example, those related to ICT skills or STEM skills, but there 
are others with more salient differences. For example, to build marketing and accounting skills, 
PIAAC includes a question on the frequency of selling products or services, but STEP does not. 
Our strategy here has been to base our choices on previous literature using the STEP survey to 
construct skills measures (Di Carlo et al., 2016; Roseth et al., 2016; Lo Bello et al., 2019) or 
combining both PIAAC and STEP to compare across countries (Lewandowski et al., 2019). The 
main difference between these previous studies and our paper is that they have focused on a 
different set of skills, mirroring the measures available in U.S. surveys instead of those available 
in the OECD PIAAC surveys.7 
 
6 The only difference is the exclusion of a variable capturing physical skills that Grundke et al. (2017) included in the 
ICT measure with a negative weight. 
7 They focus on the difference between cognitive and manual skills and between routine and non-routine tasks.  
8 
 2.2 Digital intensity 
In our econometric analysis, we also estimate differential returns, according to the digital intensity 
of each economic sector. Digital intensity refers to the degree in which the production and the 
performance of a given sector has been impacted by the digital transformation, i.e., the same set 
of technological innovations that have made relevant the skills that are the object of this study. The 
process of digital transformation is complex, involving more than a mere investment in computers, 
software, cold computing, or other digital tools, embedding them in production with the 
appropriate human capital and using them when deal (Calvino et al.,  
2018). Looking at digital intensity is important in our context because the skills most relevant to 
the digital economy may be complementary to the technologies and business practices used by 
least, study the heterogeneity on returns by the degree of digital intensity at the sector level.  
We proceed by defining an indicator variable of digital intensity for each of 36 economic sectors 
following the classification established by Calvino et al. (2018) for a subset of OECD countries. 
Using data from the Latin American region to define the digital intensive indicator variable would 
seven variables to describe a given sector as more or less digital-intensive: level of investment in 
ICT equipment, level of investment in software and databases, purchases of ICT services, 
purchases of ICT goods, robot use, revenues from online sales, and intensity of ICT specialists. 
None of these variables are reliably collected for Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) 
countries, so we use the same indicator defined by Calvino et al. (2018) but apply it to our LAC 
countries. 
To determine the extent to which transferring the OECD classifications to LAC countries 
represents a credible way to proceed, we use the only variable with some correlation to digital 
intensity available on the LAC region. The International Federation of Robotics (IFR) provides 
counts of the stock of robots by economic sector, country, and year worldwide, including the four 
countries under investigation here. We calculate the average number of robots in each economic 
sectors above the median. We compare this classification specification from the 
Latin American region to the one appearing in Calvino et al. (2018) to evaluate the viability of the  
9 
 robot use component of their digital intensive indicator. The comparison indicates a correlation of 
0.8 between the Latin American classification and the OECD classification, lending some weight 
to the use of the OECD classification in our estimates. Still, some important differences exist in 
the intensity of robot use between regions. Table A2 in Appendix A shows the average number of 
operational robots for seven aggregate economic sectors in the Latin American region, in the 
United States, and in Western Europe. The number of operational robots is between 4 and 100 
times larger in the United States and Europe, relative to Latin America. 
In conclusion, the comparison shows that LAC countries and high-income OECD countries are 
generally similar, in terms of the sectors of the economy with high digital intensity, but that the 
degree of intensity is likely to be much smaller in LAC countries than in OECD countries. 
 
3 Descriptive Analysis: The Gender Gap 
We first describe the gender gaps in the labor market and the gender differentials in the relevant 
skills variables. In terms of human capital measures, Table 1 documents the high rates of education 
of the women in our sample, relative to the men: 79% of women are high-educated (upper 
secondary education completed or more), while the percentage is 71% for men.  
In terms of labor market performance, the usual gender gap in earnings emerges: The average wage 
of low-educated women is 83% of the average wage of low-educated men; for the high-educated 
group, the value is 87%. We also find the usual gender asymmetries in the distribution of 
occupation: 32% of women are employed in this occupational category, relative to 16% of men. 
Among men, crafts and related trades is the main occupation, employing about 22% of the 
workforce. In terms of sectors, both women and men are largely employed in the services sector, 
but the percentage for women is higher, reaching 93%, while, for men, it is 86%. A similar pattern 
is found when comparing the percentages of women and men employed in digital-intensive 
sectors. For women, we are looking at 53%, while, for men, it is 50%.  The usual gender gap in 
labor market participation is also confirmed by our data: Figure 1 shows that, on average, 34% of 
women in the sample do not participate in the labor market, compared to 18% of men. There are  
10 
 important differences by education levels: Low-educated women participate at a 54% rate, while 
high-educated women participate at a 73% rate. 
Gender differences, with respect to skills relevant to the digital economy, are reported in Figure 2 
and at the bottom of Table 1. The largest difference relates to STEM, where the average skill level 
for men is 0.12 of a standard deviation above the mean, while the average for women is 0.15 of a 
standard deviation below the mean.8 A smaller disadvantage for women is observed in the context 
of ICT skills, where they hold a value 0.03 of a standard deviation below the mean compared to a 
similar value ,which is, of course, above the mean for men. On all the other three skills, men and 
women do not show noticeable differences. 
 
4 Econometric Analysis: Returns to Skills by 
Gender 
This section presents estimates of the impact of skills on hourly wages, according to gender. We 
also analyze how these returns to skills interact with the digital intensity of the sector in which the 
worker is employed. The interaction is relevant to understand how skills play a role in the process 
ders that while the digital economy 
is expanding, it may have not yet reached all the sectors of the labor market. 
The econometric analysis focuses on estimating equations of the form: 
 
  (1) 
 
where the natural log of the hourly wage of individual i of gender g in country j (wij) is regressed 
on a set of individual-level controls (the vector xij), a measure of the individual skill relevant in the 
digital economy ( sij) and a country-fixed effect ( j
the percentage change in earnings associated with a unit increase in the amount of skill s. 
Following the literature estimating earnings functions, we label this coefficient the return to skills . 
 
8 All the skill indexes are normalized to be mean zero and a standard deviation of one in the overall population. 
11 
 It is worth noting here that the parameters to be estimated are denoted by the superscript g, to 
indicate that we are estimating gender-specific coefficients. In other words, we are estimating 
equation (1) separately by gender.9 
This specification is different, with respect to the one used by OECD (2018a), which performs a 
-specific returns to skills by 
interacting a gender dummy with the skill variable and then estimating on the pooled sample of 
men and women. In terms of equation (1), this is equivalent to having the superscript g, but only 
-specific 
returns on all the variables. Without this flexibility, the returns to skills could capture some of the 
gender-specific impacts of the other covariates. We find that this specification is, indeed, relevant; 
numerous coefficients are significantly different between men and women. In Section 4.4, we 
show the extent to which using the OECD (2018a) specifications instead impacts our results.                                                     
The individual-level controls included in the vector xij are quite parsimonious, due partly to data 
availability and also to the returns we aim to identify. Specifically, the vector includes a constant, 
age and age squared, an indicator variable of completed upper secondary education or more, and 
literacy and numeracy test scores.10 In short, the baseline specification controls for broad human 
capital indicators (age and education), for a proxy of basic cognitive abilities (literacy and 
numeracy scores) and for aggregate differences between the economies (the country-fixed effects). 
The only additional controls available across all data sets, available for our inclusion in the 
specification, are sectors and occupations indicator variables. We decided not to include them in 
the baseline specification for the following reason: Choice of sector and occupation is endogenous 
and, as such, the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of a 
certain occupation/industry cell. Since we are interested in gender gaps in the overall return to 
skills, we have preferred not to decompose the returns in the component due to occupation and 
sector choices and in the component due to differences within a given sector and occupation cell. 
 
9 To simplify notation, we do not add the indicator g to the observed variables, but it is understood that we will include 
in each regression only individuals belonging of a specific gender. 
10 Literacy and numeracy test scores are, unfortunately, not available for all countries. Literacy scores are available 
for Bolivia, Colombia, and Chile, while numeracy scores are only available for Chile. We have therefore decided to 
have them interact with the country  fixed effects in the section for specification, pooling all the countries together.  
12 
 Still, estimating the coefficient conditional on industry and occupation is informative, and we 
present these estimates in Section 4.4. 
 
4.1 Main Results 
The main results on returns to skills are presented in Figure 3. The two main cognitive skills 
relevant in the digital economy ICT and STEM show positive and significant returns for both 
men and women, but, in STEM, the returns are significantly higher for men.11 Specifically, a one 
standard deviation increase in the STEM skill measure implies a 15.1% increase in wages for men 
and an 8.7% increase in wages for women. ICT skill returns are more similar across genders, 
ranging from 16.9% for women to 17.6% for men. The returns to the other skills are lower but still 
positive and significant except for marketing and accounting for women. 
Compared with the returns estimated in OECD countries, the returns to ICT and STEM are higher 
than the estimated average over the pooled set of 31 OECD countries. OECD (2018a) estimates 
returns to ICT skills to be about 12% for women and about 10.5% for men. The returns to STEM 
skills are estimated at 4% and 4.5%, for women and men, respectively. Contrary to the results for 
the four LAC countries, there is a gender gap in returns to ICT, favoring women, while there is no 
significant difference in returns to STEM by gender.12 
We have tried to determine whether the difference in results, with respect to OECD (2018a), 
derives from differences in the specification. As mentioned above, even when the variables 
employed are comparable, the specifications are slightly different: OECD (2018a) estimates that 
by having a gender dummy interacted with skills, while we prefer a more flexible specification, 
where all the returns are allowed to be gender-specific. We have run the specification preferred by 
OECD (2018a) on our data and found that the difference in specification explain only a small 
portion of the difference. We discuss the results in Section 4.4. 
The main results of the returns to skills interacted with the level of digital intensity in the sector 
are presented in Figure 4. The figure reports the additional impact of a given skill when the worker 
 
11 We report point estimates with the dot and the diamond, and the 90% confidence interval with vertical lines. As a 
result, any time that the vertical line does not cross zero, it means that the coefficient is significantly different from 
zero.
12 See Figure 1.7, page 16, OECD (2018a).  
13 
 is employed in a sector with high digital intensity. The exercise is meant to capture the extent to 
which a portion of the overall returns discussed above is due to composition effects across sectors, 
i.e., if the skills have significant and positive returns only in those sectors that are more impacted 
by the digital economy, or if they are equally valuable across all sectors. The figure shows that 
digital intensity does not generally have a significant impact: Most of the coefficients are not 
significantly different from zero, and the point estimates are very close to zero.13 Again, this result 
stands in stark contrast with the findings for OECD countries. OECD (2018a) estimates that 
working in digital-intensive industries increases returns to skill by about 2 to 3 percentage points.14 
The results for our four Latin American countries indicate that either digital intensity is not very 
pronounced in Latin America or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all the 
sectors of Latin American economies. Even with the data at our disposal, we cannot disentangle 
the two explanations, but some of the evidence discussed in Section 2.2 indicate that digital 
intensity is, indeed, less pronounced in Latin America than in OECD countries. Specifically, Table 
A2 in Appendix A shows that the average number of operational robots for seven aggregate 
economic sectors (the only direct measure of digital intensity available for LAC countries) is 
between 4 and 100 times larger in the United States and Western Europe than in Latin America. 
This result is consistent with the analysis based on the broader Digital Adoption Index, reported 
by Busso et al. (2017). The index shows that Latin America lags behind high-income economies 
in terms of availability and adoption of digital technologies.15 In other words, if the sectors of the 
economy with high digital intensity are similar between LAC countries and high-income OECD 
countries, the extent of the intensity is much smaller in LAC. 
To summarize the results obtained by aggregating the data gleaned from the four countries under 
study, (i) we estimated significant and large returns to ICT and STEM, with no significant gender 
differences on the first, but a significant gender gap in favor of men on the second. (ii) For the 
other skill measures, we found positive but lower returns with mainly not statistically significant 
differences between women and men. (iii) The digital intensity of the sectors does not seem a 
crucial factor in determining these returns. 
 
13 The exception are self-organization and marketing & accounting, which have, respectively, slightly smaller and 
slightly higher returns when used in digital-intensive sectors.  
14 See Figure 1.3, page 12, OECD (2018a). 
15 See Figure 4.8, page 95, Busso et al. (2017). 
14 
 In Appendix C, we look at each country in isolation from the others; we actually found results for 
each that are qualitatively similar to the aggregate for Chile, Bolivia, and Colombia but with some 
differences in magnitude. Returns to STEM are higher than the aggregate ofChile and lower than 
the aggregate of Bolivia and Colombia. El Salvador, on the other hand, does not report a gender 
gap favoring men in returns to STEM; both men and women have positive but similar returns. 
Returns to ICT in El Salvador are also a little different than the aggregate, indicating a higher (but 
not significantly so) return for women. Extra returns for working in digital-intensive sectors 
estimated by country confirm the aggregate results: Digital intensity does not significantly increase 
returns to skills. 
 
4.2 Heterogeneous Effects 
We focus on the heterogeneous effect on the individual characteristic most relevant with respect 
to skills formation and acquisition: schooling levels. We focus on upper secondary education, and 
we report the differential effect on the returns of individuals who completed this educational level 
with respect to individuals who completed less. The results are reported in Figure 5. They show 
that higher levels of education yield significantly higher returns for men but not for women. For 
women, the increase in returns never departs significantly from zero, and the point estimates are 
always lower than those for men. In the next section, we discuss whether these differences may be 
due to the different selection in the labor market by gender. 
These results are more mixed when looking at regressions by country (Figure C4 in Appendix C). 
In Chile, we estimate significantly higher returns for high-educated men on all skills except 
readiness to learn. In Bolivia and El Salvador, only half of the skill types demonstrate significant 
increases; in Colombia, only one. What remains broadly similar to the aggregate results is that the 
increase in returns is higher for men than women. The only important exception is Colombia, 
where the point estimate of increase in ICT and STEM is higher for women. However, the 
estimated coefficient is not significantly different from zero in either case.  
      
  
15 
 4.3 Selection in the Labor Market 
Women participate in the labor market less than men. This is a common feature among most labor 
markets, and it holds in our samples. Figure 1 shows that women participate in the labor market 
less than men at all education levels. The Web Appendix shows the results of each country. 
Because participation is non-random  i.e., it is the result of a choice  the women we observe 
working may be systematically different from those not working. If the characteristics over which 
they are different are related to their performance in the labor market, then the return to skills we 
estimated are only representative of the population of women working and not of the entire 
population of women. This bias may affect some relevant policy implications. For example, if a 
policy is successful in increasing the skill levels of women, should we expect the returns 
that were affected by the policy to be more like those of the women currently participating or the 
ones who are not? Because some of the factors related to productivity remain unobserved, it is not 
easy to answer this question. It may therefore be useful to estimate a set of returns that can indicate 
if the estimated returns of women currently working are significantly different from those of the 
overall population of women.16 
We adopt a standard Heckman selection model (Heckman, 1979) to obtain returns that consider 
selection in the labor market. To avoid relaying only on distributional assumptions for 
identification, we adopt an exclusion-restriction: W s number of 
children affects her participation decision but not the wage paid to her.17 
Results are presented in Figure 6 and show relatively small changes with respect to the baseline 
specifications reported in Figures3 and 5. Still, two small differences are worth mentioning. First, 
the point estimate of the return to ICT becomes higher for women than men. However, both in the 
baseline specification and in the selection-correction specification, the differences in returns 
between men and women are not significantly different from each other. Second, the gap in favor 
 
16 Notice that in principle, the same selection problem also applies to men but because a high proportion of men 
participate in the labor market, we follow the common practice of ignoring selection in the labor market for them. In 
other words, even if not all men participate in the labor market, the small proportion of men who do not is unlikely to 
affect the overall estimates very much. 
17 This assumption is common in the literature, but it is not without limitations. If it is true that firms cannot offer 
wage contracts contingent to the presence of children, some evidence shows that the unequal distribution of household 
work between men and women may generate a systematic (and potentially causal) association between wages and the 
presence of children.  
16 
 of men in returns to STEM is reduced because the point estimate for women increases from 8.7% 
to 9.5%. 
By looking at results by country (reported in Figure C5 of Appendix C), we can see that these 
minor changes are mainly driven by Chile. In Chile, controlling for selection increases  
returns to ICT from 18.9% to 24.0% and returns to STEM from 11.0% to 18.3%. Another relevant 
change takes place in Bolivia, where returns to STEM become significantly different 
from zero when controlling for selection. 
With respect to heterogeneous returns, correcting for selection does not qualitatively change the 
results. The results are reported in Figure 7 and should be compared to Figures 4 and 5. Overall, 
they confirm the lack of significantly higher returns for agents working in the digital-intensive 
sector and reiterate that only men have significantly higher returns when they complete upper 
secondary education. 
Finally, estimates obtained by correcting for selection show that this is not the source of differences 
with respect to returns estimated in OECD countries (OECD 2018a). Selection-correction slightly 
increases the differences because it leads to slightly higher returns to ICT and STEM for women. 
 
4.4 Robustness Analysis 
In this section, we provide a robustness analysis along three dimensions. First, we study how the 
results change when we replicate the specifications of the OECD (2018a); we constrain all the 
coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns to skills. Second, we study 
how the results change when we control for sectors and occupations. Finally, we check if the results 
controlling for selection are affected by using different exclusion-restrictions in the selection 
model. 
Results constraining all the coefficients to be the same for men and women except for the returns 
to skills are reported in Table B7. This specification consists in running equation (1) on a sample 
pooling together men and women and then interacting the women indicator variable with the 
variable measuring the specific skill under consideration. Our favorite baseline specification 
allows all the coefficients to be gender-specific because it allows for more flexibility. This different 
constrained version lets only the return to skill be gender-specific; as a result, returns to skills may  
17 
 capture some of the gender-specific impacts of the other covariates. By focusing on the two skills 
with the strongest impact in the baseline specification (ICT and STEM), the estimation results in 
the constrained specification are essentially identical to ICT and show a small difference to STEM. 
If, in the baseline specification, returns to STEM are estimated to be 15.2%, those for 
women are 6.7 percentage points lower.  returns on the constrained specification are 
estimated to be 14.9%, whereas those for women are 5.9 percentage points lower. This slightly 
lower gender gap in constrained specification is an indication that allowing for gender-specific 
returns on the other covariates and on country-fixed effects is useful for estimating returns closer 
to consistent values. 
Results controlling for sectors and occupations are reported in Table B8. As mentioned, sectors 
and occupations are important controls given that each sector/occupation cell may require and use 
the skills in the digital economy differently. Conditioning on them may clarify if the differences 
in returns we observed are due to the sorting of men and women over these cells or to different 
returns within cells. Because occupational choices are endogenous and within-sector differences 
may be affected by unobservable characteristics, this analysis remains largely descriptive. In other 
words, the overall returns to skills may legitimately include the return to the choice of a certain 
occupation. The estimation results conditioning on sectors and occupation qualitatively confirm 
the main result in the baseline specification: We estimate significant returns to ICT and STEM, 
with no significant gender differences in the former but a significant gender gap in favor of men 
in the latter. Quantitatively, both ICT and STEM returns are estimated to be lower when sectors 
and occupation controls are introduced. For example, ICT returns decreased from 16.8% 
in the baseline specification to 7.0% in the specification controlling for sector and occupation; the 
corresponding values for men were 17.4% and 7.1%, respectively. These results indicate, probably 
not surprisingly, that a portion of the returns to ICT and STEM is because individuals who possess 
those skills work in a sector and occupation that pay relatively more in comparison to people with 
a lower level of these skills. More interestingly, the gender gap in ICT returns is unaffected when 
we change the specification, unlikethe gender gap in STEM returns. In other words, conditioning 
on the sector and occupation cell,  returns to STEM are estimated to be much greater than 
 returns to STEM than in the economy as a whole. The results suggest that different 
choices of occupation and sector are not the main driver of the overall gender gap in STEM returns;  
18 
 womens occupational choices, vis-a-vis men s, decreasethe gender gap in returns present within 
sector/occupation cells. 
Results controlling for how different exclusion-restrictions affect our selection model are reported 
in Table B9. In our baseline selection model, we used the presence of children as the exclusion-
restriction, a variable very likely to affect the participation decisions of women. However, not only 
fertility decisions are endogenous, but the presence of children may also directly impact wages 
and not only participation. Still, we are limited in terms of data availability on the exclusion-
restrictions we can use in the selection model. Furthermore, the number of children is the only 
variable available on all data sets. However, if we limit ourselves to the STEP countries, we can 
use additional information. Specifically, we use information about whether the mother or father of 
the person answering the survey lives in the household. This presence may be very influential on 
the labor market participation decision of women, either because they can help in household 
production or because they need resources for their care. We therefore built an indicator variable 
for whether the mother or father of the person answering the survey is living in the household. We 
use it as an exclusion-restriction alone and jointly with the presence-of-children variable. 
Estimation results show very little sensitivity to the various exclusion-restrictions. For example, 
the overall STEM return in STEP countries is estimated to be about 5.7% without controlling for 
selection. When controlling for selection, it is estimated to be just a little lower, ranging from 
5.13% when using only the presence of children as an exclusion-restriction, to 5.17% when using 
only the presence of grandparents, to 5.16% when using both.18 
 
5 Post-Estimation Analysis: Decomposing the 
Gender Gap 
The previous section presented estimates of the returns to skills and to other individual 
characteristics by gender. Using these estimates, it is possible to decompose the overall gender gap 
 
18 We have also run OLS regressions using the exclusion-restriction variables directly in the wage regressions. We 
found that they are typically not significant, while they always are in the participation-decision equation. Although 
the exclusion-restrictions are not formally testable since we use them for identification, this reduced form results lends 
some credibility to them.

 in the portion due to differences in returns and to differences in endowments. The most popular 
procedure to accomplish this is labeled in the literature as Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition.19 It is 
simply an accounting exercise based on mean differences. The regressions we have presented in 
the previous sections and defined in equation (1) are ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions 
guaranteeing that: 
 
  (2) 
 
where the overbar denotes sample mean, the hat denotes estimated value, and the indicator g=m,w 
denotes gender-specific values. The country-fixed effect component is averaged out over all the 
individuals living in the country.20 In other words, equation (2) states that OLS estimation 
guarantees that the mean of the dependent variable is exactly predicted by the estimated 
coefficients applied to the sample mean of the regressors. Based on this result and one step of 
algebra, the gender earnings gap the difference in average earnings between men and women  
can be decomposed in the portion due to differences in the sample mean of the regressors (the 
endowments ) and in the portion due to differences in the estimated coefficients (the returns). 
Focusing on the returns and endowments of relevant skills related to the digital economy  denoted 
with s  we can write:

19 See Blinder (1973) and Oaxaca (1973). For a more recent assessment of the approach, see Oaxaca and Ransom 
(1994). For a more general decomposition involving the entire distribution, see Machado and Mata (2005). 
20 To formally define it, we need to add an indicator function di(j)=1 if individual i lives in country j, leading to: 
 
  
20 
 where the first term on the right-hand side denotes gender differences in endowments in digital-
economy-relevant skills (weighted by the male return ) and the second term denotes gender 
differences in returns to those skills (weighted by the female endowment ). 
Figure 8 reports the ratio between each of these two terms and the overall gender gap. For example, 
looking at STEM skills, we estimate that both gender differences in endowments and in returns 
have a significant impact in explaining the gender gap. The point estimates indicate that 
endowments could be responsible for up to 30% of the difference and returns for up to 80%.21 We 
see this as the main result to be drawn from the decomposition. Two other significant effects are 
present: Differences in ICT endowments have a marginally significant impact, whereas differences 
in returns in marketing and accounting have a more substantial impact, with the potential to explain 
up to 65% of the gap. We perform an additional exercise by reporting the endowment and returns 
components when including all skills measures at the same time. Results appear in the last panel 
of Figure 8 and show that endowments explain approximately 40% of the gender wage gap, while 
the returns to skills do not have any explanatory power. 
Results by country are reported in Appendix C, Figure C7. They confirm the overall main results 
for Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia: STEM has a significant impact, with differences in returns 
contributing up to 64% of the gap in Bolivia, up to 28% in Chile, and up to 90% in Colombia. El 
Salvador is the only country where STEM does not have either an economically significant or a 
statistically significant impact on the earnings gender gap. In terms of other skills, the country-by-
-country results show that the significant impact of marketing and accounting in the aggregate 
sample was mainly driven by Colombia. 
  
6 Conclusion 
We studied gender differentials in the labor market with a focus on skills relevant to the digital 
economy. Specifically, we estimated the returns to skills using standard wage regressions, but we 
allowed for heterogeneous effects and considered selection in the labor market. We focused on 
 
21 Recall that the estimated returns are based on running separate regressions, each with only one of the digital-
economy-relevant skills at the time. Since there are likely to be correlations between skills, the estimates report the 
maximum impact that the skill may have in explaining the gap.  
21 
 four Latin American countries for which all the relevant data are available: Bolivia, Chile, 
Colombia, and El Salvador.
We found that the group of skills described as ICT and as STEM have significant positive returns 
for both men and women. However, there is a significant gender gap in favor of men on the returns 
to STEM, while the returns to ICT are very similar between the two genders. We also estimated 
the returns in specifications allowing for heterogeneity by education and sector of occupation. We 
found that having upper secondary education or higher implies significantly higher returns for men 
but not for women. Unlike the results obtained on OECD countries (OECD, 2018a; OECD, 
2018b), we did not find any significant impact related to working in a digital-intensive sector. This 
means that either digital intensity is less pronounced in Latin American countries than OECD 
countries or that the skills under consideration are valuable across all sectors of Latin American 
economies. All these results are confirmed when controlling for selection in the labor market for 
women. We also performed a robustness analysis where we studied how results change by varying 
the specification and by employing various exclusion-restrictions in the selection model. 
Finally, we provided a decomposition of how skills relevant to the digital economy may contribute 
to the gender gap in wages. By computing a standard Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition based on our 
estimates, we concluded that both gender differences in endowments and in returns to STEM skills 
have a significant impact in explaining the gender gap in earnings. The point estimates indicate 
that endowments could be responsible for up to 30% of the difference and returns for up to 80%. 
The summary of results provided so far is aggregated over the four countries under consideration. 
Many of our results were confirmed when performing the same analysis for each country 
separately. The most relevant differences between countries concerned returns to STEM. They 
were estimated to be higher than the aggregate in Chile and lower than the aggregate in Bolivia 
and Colombia. El Salvador is the only country not reporting a gender gap in favor of men in returns 
to STEM. As a result, El Salvador is the only country for which gender differences related to 
STEM skills do not explain the overall gender gap in earnings. 
Why returns to STEM exhibit such strong gender asymmetries can only be partially answered by 
our analysis. The list of possible explanations is broad. The first possibility is selection into 
different sectors and occupations; men and women may systematically choose to work in different 
jobs, even when possessing similar skills. Our robustness analysis controlling for sectors and  
22 
 occupations indicated that this is not the case: The within-sector and occupation gaps are higher
than the overall gap. The second possibility is selection in the labor market, i.e.,women participate 
in the labor market at a lower proportion than men. If only the relatively less productive women 
participate, then their lower returns may reflect a genuine productivity differential. Our analysis 
estimating a series of selection models indicated that this mechanism may at most explain a very 
small portion of the differential. The third possibility is different labor market experiences and 
labor market attachments. Some evidence suggests that time investments in household production 
are very different between men and women.22 This is reflected both in the extensive and intensive 
margins of labor supply. The extensive margin differential is reflected in the lower participation 
rate for women, and the selection models we estimated take this into account. The intensive margin 
is reflected in hours worked, which is accounted for by using hourly wages as dependent variables 
in our estimations. However, there is an important dynamic element that our static estimates could 
not properly consider; over time, a lower labor supply implies lower accumulation of human 
capital on the job. Our controls for labor market experience is very crude, and therefore, some of 
the impact of human capital accumulation on the job may be picked up by other returns, such as 
returns to education and returns to skills. The only objection to this explanation is that human 
capital accumulation on the job should involve all skills, not only STEM skills, while we estimate 
the gender gap only on STEM returns. The fourth possibility is discrimination against women in 
STEM professions. There is a growing, even if by no means conclusive, literature suggesting that 
STEM and related professions may be more prone to gender discrimination than other 
professions.23 With the data at our disposal, we neither can exclude nor confirm such an 
explanation. Finally, the fifth possibility is that the quality of the STEM skills acquired by men 
and women may be different, explaining the gap in terms of underlining productivity differentials. 
This may result from human capital acquired before entering the labor market. By controlling for 
numeracy score, our regressions should condition on some of those differences, but the difference 
may result also from human capital acquired on the job after entering the labor market. This is the 
same mechanism we described when discussing the dynamic implication of gender differences in 
 
22 Evidence collected in time-use survey provides convincing evidence in this respect. For cross-country evidence, see 
van der Lippe et al. (2011) and Apps and Rees (2005). For evidence on a Latin American country, see Salazar-Saenz 
(2019) on Colombia. 
23 See, for example, Buffington et al. (2016) and Carrell et al. (2010).  
23 
 labor supply. Given the limited controls for dynamic behavior in our empirical models, this is 
another mechanism that cannot be ruled out. 
In conclusion, we found that if investing in skills relevant to the digital economy, specifically in 
ICT and STEM, may be beneficial for the labor market performance of both men and women, it 
remains a relevant open question in understanding why returns to STEM exhibit such a strong 
gender gap. Our results can rule out some explanations but cannot precisely point to the actual 
mechanism. At least two explanations remain good candidates to explain the gender gap in STEM 
returns: the presence of stronger discrimination against women in STEM-related professions than 
in other professions and the life-cycle impact of a different rate of human capital accumulation on 
the job between men and women. The first suggests policies directly targeting the labor market, 
and the second suggests policies improving work-life balance for both men and women.24

Abstract
Purpose –The purpose of this paper is to discover the contextual factors affecting the development of
digital library education (DLE) in Vietnam and to determine how those factors are enabling or hindering itsdevelopment.
Design/methodology/approach –Based upon the literature and the theories of Fullan (2007) ,Nowlen
(1988) and Rogers (2003), an initial model of contextual factors that were potentially affecting DLE
development in Vietnam was developed. The model was then tested using a qualitative methodologyinvolving interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders, along with the gathering of documentary
evidence. The data were then analysed using the interactive model of Miles et al. (2014) , and the initial model
was then revised.
Findings –The initial model allowed for the depiction of potential factors, both internal and external, along
with some relationships between the factors. Based on the data analysis, a revised model was developed
composed of seven major contextual factors that were enabling and/or hindering DLE development in theVietnamese context. These are grouped into three categories: external factors –government, IT infrastructure
and social and cultural values; internal factors –stakeholders ’attitudes, DLE characteristics and the personal
and organisational nexus; and change agents, which is both an internal and external factor. These factors had
different levels of in ﬂuence on DLE development and are inter-related.
Originality/value –No prior study has looked at contextual factors affecting DLE development in a
developing country such as Vietnam.

Introduction
The concept of the “digital library ”wasﬁrst popularised in the 1990s and is in widespread
use today. A digital library (DL) uses technologies that were not previously available;therefore, the library and information management (LIM) ﬁeld requires educational
programmes better attuned to the needs of the profession in which employment in a DL isbecoming more commonplace. The central topic of this paper is the demand for digital
library education (DLE) in developing countries. This paper describes the creation of aDigital library

conceptual model of the factors that affect the development of DLE, a model that can be used
to analyse the DLE environment in Vietnam and any similar country.
The authors contend that DLE has grown too slowly in Vietnam and, as a result, libraries
cannot recruit suf ﬁcient LIM graduates with the necessary competencies to work in a DL. If
this is so in Vietnam, then other countries are likely to have the same problem, especiallythose in Southeast Asia with cultures similar to Vietnam and also those that have yet tobuild a digital information economy.
Country background
Vietnam has seen the slow but steady introduc tion of computerised systems and digital
resources into its larger libraries. Applying ne w technologies to modernise the library sector
with a particular focus on DL development and th e digitisation of highly valued materials were
objectives stated in the Master Library Development Plan (
MCST-Ministry of Culture, Sports
and Tourism, 2007 ). After one decade (2000-2010) focusing intensively on automation,
Vietnam ’s libraries moved on to establish digital lib raries, develop digital collections and
provide online services ( Do, 2014 ). A signi ﬁcant problem with continuing the transformation of
Vietnam ’s libraries is that they have been challenged by the lack of suitably quali ﬁed staff;
reports show that 49 per cent of LIM practitioners do not have DL competencies ( Tran and Do,
2014), and there is an urgent need for digital librarians ( Nguyen, 2017b ); hence, improving the
quality of the human resource is the main priority of the Vietnam library strategy ( MCST-
Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, Library Department, 2017 ).
The problem
Staff who work in DLs need knoweldge and com pentieces not previousy associated with
library work ( Bury and Jamieson, 2014 ;Muhammad and Khalid, 2010 ) and traditional
education programmes have not prepared staff f or it. Recent research has shown globally the
number of DLE programmes has increased ( Nieuwenhuysen, 2011 ;Nguyen and Chowdhury,
2013;Myburgh and Tammaro, 2013 ;Audunson and Shuva, 2016 ) though none of these was in
Vietnam. This research project sought to ﬁll a gap not only in our knowledge of DLE in
Vietnam but also to contribute to developments i n this area that might be relevant to countries
similar to Vietnam. The different pace of DLE d evelopment in countries around the world must
depend upon the local situation so this resear ch examines the context of DLE development.
Purpose
The intention of the study was to discover the cont extual factors that either enable or hinder the
development of DLE in Vietnam. The practical va l u eo ft h i si sc l e a r :i fg o v e r n m e n ts t a f f ,p o l i c y
makers, academics and leading practitioners unde rstand the factors that are currently standing
in the way of developing DLE then those barrie rs can be removed or lowered. If the enabling
factors are appreciated then actions can be t aken to stimulate more DLE development. The
theoretical value lies in the development of a mo del of contextual factors affecting DLE. The
model also shows relations between the factors . Some factors are enablers, some are barriers
and some operate as both. This is an addition to the literature on DLE.

Literature review
This section is a review of studies relating to DLE, in particular issues affecting itsdevelopment. Elements from the literature review were used in combination with theories of
Fullan (2007) ,Nowlen (1988) and Rogers (2003) to develop an initial model of factors
affecting the development of DLE in Vietnam. This was used as a basis for data analysis in
the investigation. The initial model was re ﬁned in light of the data analysis to become the
ﬁnal model.
Digital library education
Working in the networked environment with digital information and computers is a key
driver of the changing roles of LIM practitioners and requires them to acquire new skills and
knowledge ( Bury and Jamieson, 2014 ;Dakshinamurti and Braaksma, 2005 ;Fourie, 2004 ;
Muhammad and Khalid, 2010 ). To become DL professionals, future LIM practitioners must
learn, and current LIM practitioners need to upgrade, technical knowledge and skills; this isone of the main issues in DLE development ( Maet al., 2009 ;Maroso, 2005 ).
From the literature, especially from Choi and Rasmussen (2006) ,Myburgh and Tammaro
(2013) ,Hartnett (2014) ,Raju (2014) and Tammaro (2017) , the competencies of DL
professionals can be summarised into three categories: technological knowledge and skills(e.g. personal IT skills, knowledge/awareness of IT systems and applications, Webknowledge, data mining and data management); library-related knowledge and skills (e.g.
users ’needs, user/customer care and user education, digital archiving and preservation,
cataloguing, metadata, indexing, collection development, visual reference services); andother knowledge and skills (e.g. information literacy, research skills, communication skills,understanding of relevant legal matters). The identi ﬁcation of these competencies informed
this study in terms of examining LIM education in Vietnam and the DLE needs of LIM
practitioners.
The development of digital libraries in Vietnam
In the early 2000s, library systems in Vietnam received signi ﬁcant investment from
universities, the government and international organisations ( National Library of Vietnam,
2008). In 2001, the National Library of Vietnam started the national project “Building the
National Electronic/Digital Library in the National Library of Vietnam ”, which focused on
building the infrastructure of information technology and electronic resources. In the pastdecade, integrated library systems have been implemented in major public and academic
libraries and information centres. Most public libraries today provide online searching, and
share catalogue records ( National Library of Vietnam, 2008 ).
Signiﬁcantly, academic libraries in Vietnam have been active in building digital libraries.
A considerable grant from the World Bank, the East Meets West Foundation and AtlanticPhilanthropies funded the improvement in the capacity of university libraries. Various
projects have focused on improving the IT infrastructure, library system software, relevant
information resources and on educating librarians. Consequently, some digital libraries andﬁve Learning Resource Centres (LRCs) have been built (
The Atlantic Philanthropies, 2018 ),
one of which, in Hue, houses an ongoing project to digitise texts that preserve the royal
history and culture of the city.
Despite some improvements in the digital infrastructure, Vietnam has a large number of
libraries and information centres that still need to be modernised. The demands are stated insome national project plans. The
National Library of Vietnam (2008) claimed that in future
Vietnam must prioritise library development, encourage the implementation of information
technology and promote digitisation. In addition, high-level technology must be applied toDigital library

modernise the library sector with particular focus on digital and e-library development, and
100 per cent of highly valued materials must be digitalised ( MCST-Ministry of Culture,
Sports and Tourism, 2007 ). For academic libraries, building digital library systems to share
national information resources, as well as to link to digital resources of international
universities, is the highest priority ( MOET-Ministry of Education and Training, 2009 ).
Researchers such as Cao (2000) ,Nguyen (2005) ,Ta (2000) ,Vu (2007) ,Do (2014) and
Nguyen (2017b) have examined the LIM ﬁeld in Vietnam and agree that there has been
signiﬁcant development in applying technologies. The researchers, however, warned of the
challenges for stakeholders in developing DLs such as ﬁnances, staff development,
stakeholder attitudes and government policies. These issues contributed to the development
of the initial model in this research.
The above researchers also pointed out challenges for the LIM profession in Vietnam.
First, librarians have to establish plans for developing digital resources and DLs though
they lack experience and knowledge of advanced technology in these areas. Second, andimportantly for this research, LIM schools have to upgrade their curricula as well as create
new curricula for educating a modern labour force to meet the requirements for LIM
development.
LIM educational change and digital library education
LIM education curricula and teaching methods have been partially reformed (MOET-
Ministry of Education and Training, 2009). For instance, from 2007 to 2009, the Faculty of
Library and Information Science in the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in
Hanoi reformed its curriculum in terms of content and teaching methods. Some older
subjects were eliminated, while subjects focused on developing new knowledge and skills
for LIM practitioners were added to the curriculum. The contents of some subjects were also
updated (
Do, 2014 ;Lam, 2014 ;Nguyen, 2017b ).
Some universities (e.g. Can Tho University and Hanoi University of Culture) worked
collaboratively with international institutions to develop LIM educational programmes
(Welch and Murray, 2007 ). They aimed to enhance the quality of educational programmes
and to reach international standards in LIM education. Some DLE subjects were added to
their curricula. Murray and Welch (2007 , 2009 ), who have been involved in designing and
delivering LIM training and education in Vietnam, reported that the shortage of quali ﬁed
staff is a challenge for introducing a new internationally recognised curriculum in Vietnam.
Research on DLE in Vietnam has focused mostly on speci ﬁc aspects of DLs (such as the
contents of a DL) rather than DLE. The research on DLs in Vietnam was started by Vu
(1999) . He analysed the conditions in Vietnam and the opportunities for developing DLs,
recommending that they should be implemented in Vietnam. Nguyen (2014) gave an
overview of DLs in Vietnam as well as DL training on Greenstone software. Tran and Do
(2007) provided an overview of library automation in Vietnam, focussing on the technology,
hardware, software, standards, equipment and education for developing automated library
systems as well as DLs. More recently, a conference on DLE in Vietnam focused mostly on
developing digital collections, archiving and preservation, software solutions, management
and bene ﬁts of digital libraries rather than discussing educating human resources and DLE
(Nguyen, 2017a ).
Nguyen (2008 ,2016) used the performance model developed by Nowlen (1988) to identify
and prioritise the learning needs for continuing professional development of Vietnamese
academic library managers and operational staff. She identi ﬁed competencies related to DLs
as one of the main areas of their learning needs. Speci ﬁc content included digital library
creation, digital collection development and copyright issues in the digital environment.GKMC
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
Tran (2009) ,Do (2014) andNguyen (2017b) identi ﬁed a gap between theory and practice
in the LIM ﬁeld in Vietnam, in other words between what is taught in universities and what
is required in practice. In particular, most graduates lack suf ﬁcient knowledge of technology
(Nguyen, 2008 ) and according to one educator, only 51.8 per cent of librarians are competent
in using computers ( Do, 2014 ). Others have noted that only 30 per cent of librarians in
Vietnam are equipped with the competencies required to meet the needs of its libraries ( Do
and Pham, 2009 ). Indeed, many researchers have found that education and training for
librarians in Vietnam needs to be reformed and updated with new knowledge to meet the
requirements of the information age ( Cao, 2003 ;Tran, 2009 ;Nguyen, 2017 ).
The conference on Human Resources for the Library and Information Field, which was
held at the Vietnam National University, Hanoi in 2009, concluded with two key points.
First, the human resources in libraries did not match demand, especially the demands of
library automation and developing DLs. Second, library education institutions needed to
have curricula better suited to provide the knowledge and skills for librarians in the digital
world ( VNU-Vietnam National University, 2009 ).Murray and Welch (2009) said of the
Vietnamese LIM ﬁeld that “there is a shortage of quali ﬁed library staff and the library
schools are not producing enough graduates with the necessary levels of expertise ”(p. 86).
This problem cannot be solved instantly and the LIM ﬁeld is challenged with the shortage
(Do, 2014 ;Nguyen, 2017b ).
Perhaps as a result of the concerns mentioned above, LIM schools in Vietnam have
started to update their curricula to move into the era of DLs. Nguyen (2008) , Chowdhury
(2013) and Do (2014) raised the level of awareness of DLE needs for Vietnamese LIM
practitioners by introducing a knowledge map of core topics for DLs and outlining the trend
of DL development in Vietnam. More recently, Lam (2014) conducted a survey of IT subjects
related to DLs in current LIM educational programmes in Vietnam. She found that LIM
schools have introduced roughly 33 per cent new ICT-related subjects into their educationalprogrammes. LIM education in Vietnam, however, has still not achieved signi ﬁcant progress
in DLE development.
Although Vietnamese scholars and professionals have acknowledged the importance of
DLE and made some suggestions for DLE programmes, their work has focused primarily on
describing DL concepts and has emphasised the role of LIM departments in educating
human resources for DLs. Their work has not examined the underlying causes of the
situation in Vietnam, i.e. it has not identi ﬁed the enabling and inhibiting factors that are
affecting DLE development.
Methodology
Based on the recursive research process of Gorman and Clayton (2005) , the research was
implemented in three stages:
(1) developing an initial conceptual model;(2) testing the model with qualitative data; and
(3) revising the conceptual model.
Based upon the literature and three theories described later in this section, an initial model
was created with several contributing factors that might enable or hinder the growth of DLEin Vietnam. The factors were subjected to analysis using documentary evidence and
qualitative data from interviews and focus groups.
To investigate the contextual factors affecting DLE development we drew upon the
spoken words of people closely involved with DLE development in Vietnam. TheDigital library

interpretivist viewpoint facilitates a deep understanding of the phenomena through the
explanations, thoughts, perceptions and words of research participants. Qualitative researchseeks to understand social reality and provides a rich description of people and interactionin natural settings. It aims to “understand how social order is created through talk and
interaction ”(
Bryman, 2008 , p. 367).
The data collection included 17 interviews and 11 focus groups involving 70 participants:
LIM practitioners; LIM managers; LIM lecturers and deans of LIM schools (including the
school that set the curriculum that other schools had to use); chairpersons of professional
associations; and representatives from business and government. Interviewees and focusgroup members were chosen using purposive sampling. The logic of purposive sampling:
Lies in selecting information-rich cases for study in depth. Information-rich cases are those from
which one can learn a great deal about issues of central importance to the purpose of the research
(Patton, 2002 , p. 169).
Data analysis procedures used the interactive model ( Miles et al.,2 0 1 4 ) that consists of four
sequential steps: transcribing the interview data, reducing data (coding and comparing),displaying data and drawing conclusions. Reducing data strictly followed three steps:
identifying initial codes, developing concepts and establishing categories. To establish
validity, the results of data analysis were checked against other sources, for example,responses of key stakeholders were compared with existing publications from their
organisations. To improve reliability, we ensured consistency in the use of the criteria to
select the participants in the research.
We used MS Excel with the initial codes that were developed from the raw data. This
programme allowed ﬂexibility in creating, ﬁltering and grouping ideas, concepts, categories
and themes. The ideas, views, comments and stat ements from all participants and documents
were recorded verbatim. The keywords us ed to extract quotations were initially ﬁltered and
grouped by concepts that were then ﬁltered and grouped into categor ies. Finally, the categories
were used to establish themes which highlight ke y factors affecting DLE development. This
use of Excel to analyse qualitative data is similar to that of Swallow et al. (2003) . The revised
themes and categories were subsequently used to revise the initial model.
The initial model
Based on the theories of Fullan (2007) ,Nowlen (1988) and Rogers (2003) and elements from
the literature review, a range of potential factors were identi ﬁed and adapted for inclusion in
the initial model. A key concept is that of an “innovation ”. Rogers (2003) de ﬁned an
innovation as “an idea, practice, or object that is perceived as new by an individual or other
unit of adoption ”(p. 12). Though this de ﬁnition is most often used for research related to
new technologies or devices as innovations, it can also be used for intangibles such as a new
management practice or a new curriculum for an educational programme, and it is the
deﬁnition used in this research.
According to Fullan (2007) , educational change is a complex proposition and educational
innovation is multidimensional. Fullan comprehensively discussed factors affecting
educational change at all levels, from national governments to learners, emphasising social
factors in the change process. As he stated, “educational change is technically simple and
socially complex ”(p. 84). He grouped factors into three main categories: characteristics of
change; local characteristics; and external factors. Characteristics of change are need, clarity,
complexity and quality/practicality. Local characteristics are district, community, principaland teacher and external factors lie in government and other agencies. In the context of thisstudy, “need ”is easy to understand (and very similar to Nowlen ’s use of the concept);GKMC
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
“clarity ”means the goals of the innovation and that the means of its implementation must
be clear for success; “complexity ”is about the dif ﬁculty and extent of change, and therefore
the knowledge and skills required to put the change into practice, so for DLEimplementation, this factor was considered to be related to the skills required, the beliefs ofindividuals, teaching strategies and the use of required materials by LIM educators and LIMpractitioners; “quality and practicality ”relate not only to the perceived value of the
innovation but also the resources needed for its implementation. In this study, the “local
characteristics ”were re-interpreted for a university environment; hence, the experiences and
opinions of deans, lecturers and students were all highly relevant, as were the opinions ofrepresentatives of the professional LIM community and professional associations.
To identify additional factors that were potentially affecting the development of DLE in
Vietnam, this project used Nowlen's Performance Model (1988) of continuing education for
professionals. The model consists of eight elements: update needs; new role preparation;
applied human relations; critical skills of mind; individual/organisational learning skills;personal/organisational development balance; life skills; and in ﬂuences of environments and
cultures of practice. Update needs are particularly important and are self-explanatory:practitioners continuously need to acquire fresh knowledge and skills to keep up-to-date
with new technology and new legislation required by their current as well as future work.
The in ﬂuence of the environment and culture is also very important. In the model cultural
values, government policies and ﬁnancial resources need to be considered as factors
affecting the learning agendas of individuals and organisations. In Vietnam, people hold
strong traditional social/cultural values, there is an education system that is centrally
controlled, and LIM programmes that are highly conventional in their content; these arepotential factors affecting the development of DLE.
Change agents were deemed important for the implementation of an innovation by both
Fullan (2007) and Rogers (2003). It is the latter ’sd eﬁnition that has been used in this study: a
change agent is “an individual who in ﬂuences clients ’innovation-decisions in a direction
deemed desirable by a change agency ”(p. 366), but the point that a change agent can be
internal or external is taken from both Fullan and Rogers.
The factors adapted from the theories were gro uped into seven categories. The initial model
included the potential contextual factors affe cting DLE development in Vietnam, which were
separated into internal factors (existing insid e the educational system) and external factors
(that come from outside the system). It was assu med that many of these factors would interact
with and affect each other, and some would have a stronger in ﬂuence than others.
Figure 1 provides the initial model of potential factors affecting the development of DLE
in Vietnam.
Internal factors
Internal factors are those closest to the core of DLE development –for example, stakeholders
have the closest ties to DL services and resources, and the DLE needs identi ﬁed by those
stakeholders. The internal factors were:
Stakeholders and their characteristics
Fullan (2007) contended that internal as well external stakeholders contribute to educational
change.
LIM practitioners/students are the learners who should be at the centre of educational
activities. Their characteristics in this model were seen as learning needs, attitudes, basicknowledge and skills and aspirations and motivations, all of which potentially affect the
objectives, content, format and methods of DLE.Digital library
education

LIM educators (lecturers) need to understand the importance of DLE and to act as advocates
for its development (though they can also resist change), so their attitudes were consideredto be crucial for DLE development in Vietnam.
LIM leaders are the directors of libraries and deans of LIM educational programmes.
They are the key decision makers who represent their organisations in internal and externaldiscussion of issues pertinent to the need for DLE, and therefore can affect its development.
LIM professional bodies are the LIM associations in Vietnam. They work with the
professional community to identify the knowledge and skills required for LIM practitioners.
Other stakeholders include individuals or organisations with an interest in DLE
development, such as the university administrations that fund academic programmes, andprivate companies involved in developing DL products for libraries.
Needs for digital library education
Understanding the needs for DLE was considered vital for this research.
Fullan (2007)
recognised that successful educational change not only requires identi ﬁcation of the needs
but also requires formal recognition of those needs. By identifying the knowledge and skillsthat organisations require to provide DL resources and services, and that LIM practitionersmust acquire, it then becomes possible to determine the content for DLE.
Characteristics of DLE: clarity, complexity, quality/practicality
This factor, as might be expected, is closely related to the previous factor, DLE needs .I ti s
through the understanding of DLE needs that the characteristics of DLE become clear. Withclarity, it is easier for potential providers to conceptualise what DLE involves, to determinehow complex it will be to develop and to decide how practical it will be in terms of theresources needed to achieve a high quality outcome.
Fullan (2007) pointed out that “lack ofFigure 1.

clarity - diffuse goals and unspeci ﬁed means of implementation –represents a major
problem at the implementation stage [ ...]”(p. 89).
Personal and organisational development balance
According to Nguyen (2008) ,the nexus of personal and organisational needs plays an
important role in continuing professional development. For this study, if the DLE needs ofthe practitioners and their organisations were balanced, the performance of both would be
improved and therefore DLE would be considered to be of greater value.
Digital library profession
This factor refers to digital librarians, and in particular, the competencies they must have to
perform their roles. In the Vietnam context, th eD Lp r o f e s s i o ni sr e p r e sented by the Vietnam
Library Association.
External factors
External factors considered to be contextual were those with the potential to affect the
development of DLE.
Social and cultural values
The social and cultural values in Vietnam are considered relevant because they affect what a
society perceives to be important in terms of the educational needs of individuals andorganisations (
Nowlen, 1988 ).Nguyen (2008 ,2016), for example, found that social and
cultural values affected Vietnamese society's views of library work, which ultimatelyaffected library practitioners' choices for professional development.
Economic conditions
Economic conditions will very likely affect the development of DLE and so are considered a
part of the external environment.
Government
The Library Department of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST) has
responsibility for governing libraries and information centres in terms of professional andtechnical standards, and the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) for governing thecurricula and quality of education of LIM schools. Other government agencies also haveresponsibilities that affect LIM education.
Change agents
Managers, deans, practitioners and educators as well as their organisations are possible change
agents among the internal factors, and government of ﬁcials and their organisations are potential
change agents among the external factors. It was necessary to identify who the change agents
were, what their actual roles were in DLE deve lopment and factors that were affecting their
success.
Results and discussion
The government
Data from the interviews, focus groups and the documentary evidence pointed to the
Vietnamese government as the most in ﬂuential factor affecting DLE development inDigital library

Vietnam, both as an enabler and as a barrier. Government also has a signi ﬁcant impact on
the LIM profession, education (schools and universities) and the IT infrastructure.
As an enabling factor, the government introduced policies aimed at enhancing education
quality and developing the use of technology. The Ordinance of Libraries (Standing
Committee of the National Assembly, 2000 ) was a landmark policy guiding the future
development of LIM. It stated that all libraries and information centres play important rolesin developing knowledge among citizens and supporting the development of education andtechnology. MOET has released many regulations and requirements, such as standards foracademic libraries ( MOET-Ministry of Education and Training, 2007 ) and for high school
libraries ( MOET-Ministry of Education and Training, 2003 ) aimed at helping lecturers and
teachers shift to using more student-centred teaching methods. In addition to policydevelopment, the government aids libraries ﬁnancially. A government of ﬁcial emphasised
how his department was actively involved in developing LIM staff resources:
This Department plays an important role in managing the LIM ﬁeld. Developing human
resources is a natural and important role of the Department because the human resource
determines the success of all activities in the LIM ﬁeld. The government emphasises that
investment in the labour force has to meet the demands of development of the LIM ﬁeld.
In terms of management, some government actions hindered the development of DLE. One
of the deans described a gap between policies and practice in Vietnam, saying the policiesnormally looked good on paper, but faced challenges when applied in practice.
An issue that deans and lecturers frequently mentioned was the strict governance by
MOET of issue curriculum content. At the level of government management, power distance(PD –see later) was evident. It prevented LIM schools communicating their need for changes
to LIM curricula to the Ministry, thus constraining LIM change. The deans complained thatthe government ignored suggestions about content for the basic LIM curriculum from allschools except a chosen few. The two current LIM educational curricula that are managedby the government were released from just one school; that is, one LIM school decided thecurriculum that has to be applied by all other LIM schools. One dean expressed his dismay:
We [his school] sent our comments about the curriculum, but did not receive any feedback. Now
we have to follow their curriculum. It is not fair.
This form of direct government control limited the creativity and independence of LIM
schools and LIM organisations.
Stakeholder attitudes
Rogers (2003) contended that stakeholders only adopt something new (which in this
research is DLE) when they know what it is and why they should adopt it. This researchfound that stakeholders thought DLs are important for the future of the LIM, but many didnot clearly understand the DL concept. This situation resulted in stakeholder attitudeshaving both positive and negative effects on DL development and ultimately on DLE.
Level of understanding of DL concepts
The cloudy understanding of the DL concept amongst many stakeholders slowed the
development of DLE in Vietnam, partly because it meant LIM practitioners had only alimited ability to express their needs for DLE. The data show that only a small number ofstakeholders thoroughly understood the DL concept, while most others did not have a clear
understanding. One library manager said some in the profession used “digital library ”as aGKMC
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
fashion term (i.e. they did not understand the term but heard so many others using it they
decided to follow suit). Another manager said:
Sometimes they do DL projects as they want to improve their image. They implemented DL
projects because other libraries have done so, not because of their actual needs.
Some stakeholders suggested developing a general de ﬁnition of DLs for use in the LIM ﬁeld. It
would act as a framework that wou ld provide the requirements, standards and structures of DLs.
With this understanding, managers would then b e capable of deciding if LIM practitioners
(current staff) needed education in digital library competences. A government of ﬁcial said:
First, we have to develop a DL de ﬁnition for Vietnam. Then we have to reach an agreement on the
deﬁnition among the LIM community. Based on that, we have to de ﬁne the framework of digital
libraries, identify the functions, aspects, and requirements of DLs. Above all, we have to educate
people who can manage the system. Based on the de ﬁnition and framework we will identify who
is needed for DLs, what the knowledge and skills are for DLs that should be o ﬀered for LIM
professionals.
Attitudes of stakeholders to change
There is a Vietnamese saying that “the only people who like change are wet babies ”.B o t h
Fullan (2007) and Rogers (2003) contended that most people do not want to change, and this
project has shown that taking the necessary steps to initiate change was a challenge formany LIM stakeholders. There were positive exceptions, but some could still see largebarriers in the form of staff resistance. One library manager said:
Our LIM ﬁeld is like a housewife who does not know or care that non-stick pans are already
invented. Instead of choosing a non-stick pan with advanced technology to make her work easier,
she insists on using the old aluminium pan, and wastes time in scrubbing. It is so hard to change
the minds of people in the LIM ﬁeld.
In the LIM schools, some deans were active in c hanging curricula by adding more DL content,
but others preferred to continue teaching trad itional competences. They argued that many
libraries, mostly in the rural areas, had not cha nged, so if LIM schools teach digital competencies
many graduates would not be able to work in non-computerised libraries. A dean said:
We still have to teach traditional library skills such as how to present a catalogue card. If we
teach technology or digital libraries, students will not be able to work in libraries that do not have
the technological and digital environment
This perception is clearly a barrier to DLE.
Limited cooperation among stakeholders
Hallam and Partridge (2004 , p. 21) stated that “collaborative partnerships are the key to the
future of LIS education ”. In this study, we found little cooperation between library
departments, professional associations, LIM schools and in ﬂuential libraries related to DLE
development. There were two reasons for the lack of cooperation in the development of DLcurricula among LIM schools. First, the government imposed the LIM curriculum. Second,
the deans restricted curriculum sharing because they were afraid that other schools might
copy them. It is acknowledged that in many countries, LIM schools develop curriculaindependently, but in Vietnam, the stakeholders, many of them working in LIM schools,expressed a wish to cooperate more on curriculum development but could not do so. Anadditional factor for deans to consider was the growing competition for students withinDigital library

universities. Adding new and popular subjects is a device that can be used by LIM schools
as a way to attract more students.
The younger generation ’s perspective
There is a gap between younger lecturers and older lecturers in their attitudes to educationalcontent and pedagogy. The younger LIM lecturers appear to be active in LIM educationalchange; they want to research DLs, and they are willing to change their current teachingsubjects to DLE subjects if required. In this research, younger lecturers are those under 35years old; the documentary evidence showed that two-thirds of LIM academic staff are
younger lecturers. Their enthusiasm is an enabler for DLE.
Some older lecturers had a different view. One older lecturer provided the following
perspective:
Some younger lecturers are very expert in technology, software libraries, and new library
standards. However, they do not have a theoretical framework of the LIM ﬁeld. They need to ﬁnd
a balance between theory and practice.
Digital library education characteristics
This factor relates to the need for DLE, the DLE content in current LIM educational
programmes and the ability of LIM schools to develop and implement DLE. According to
Fullan (2007) ,“need ”is one of the most important characteristics of educational change, and
the need for DLE was expressed by LIM practitioners, LIM managers, LIM school deans andby students. Some LIM practitioners, particularly younger ones and LIM studentsrecognised that they needed DLE programmes to update their skills and knowledge so theycould ﬁnd work in the changing environment. As a contrast, some practitioners suggested
that DLE should be offered to LIM managers to help them understand DLs and possibly
change their attitudes about DL development. LIM managers need staff with DLcompetencies so they expect LIM schools to develop DLE for current LIM practitioners.
The recognition of the educational need of many stakeholders was an enabling factor for
DLE development. Figure 2 presents the effects of the LIM profession ’s need for change in
LIM education in which DLE is considered a new element that will enable LIM schools tosatisfy educational needs.
This paper has not suggested content for DLE programmes. Fullan (2007) says “precise
need is often not clear at the beginning ”(p. 89). As an example of the debate about content,
Figure 2.

most LIM managers and educators argued that a digital librarian needs competence in IT
but does not need to become an IT expert and only some digital librarians need to beproﬁcient in writing code.
Eﬀect of the lack of infrastructure and lecturers
The data indicate that there were two factors hindering LIM schools in developing DLE
programmes: the de ﬁciency of infrastructure for DLE development, and the lack of lecturers
for DLE.
All the deans thought that DLE needed modern computer labs for students. Of the ﬁve
LIM schools in this study, only one had a dedicated computer lab for its students; the otherschools had to rent labs. A senior lecturer at one school commented that the lack ofopportunities for practice inhibited her school from introducing new DLE subjects.
Another serious issue was the fact that LIM schools lacked lecturers who could
implement DLE programmes. All deans in this study con ﬁrmed that the shortage of
lecturers was a major issue that restricted the growth of DL subjects in the LIM curricula.Several deans said they lacked lecturers for DLE subjects and usually needed to recruit from
outside the school if they wished to offer those subjects. One dean said
I understand that there are many interesting subjects that can be added to our curriculum. Myself,
I would like to introduce new subjects, or even open a new programme. However, looking at ourstaﬀ, who can teach these subjects? How many lecturers do we have to teach these subjects? No,
we do not have sta ﬀfor these subjects.
It can be seen that these issues negatively affect the development of DLE. However, as one
dean emphasised, LIM schools have to be active in preparing for change if they do not wantto be losers in the ﬁerce competition among LIM schools.
Information technology infrastructure
Stakeholders agreed that IT has changed the LIM ﬁeld dramatically in terms of its
management and the technological infrastructure. Most of the interviewees believed that the
development of DLs bene ﬁted from IT development in Vietnam. For example, Internet
access in Vietnam had increased sharply in the past decade (
VNNIC-Vietnam Network
Information Centre, 2018 ). The data from documentary evidence also indicated signi ﬁcant
development in IT applications in libraries and information centres.
Social and cultural values
The social and cultural environment is an important factor for bringing about educational
change. Ely (1990) contended that besides the characteristics of the innovation, the
environment in which the innovation is to be introduced plays a crucial part in the change ’s
success. According to Nguyen (2009) , Confucianism has a profound impact on Vietnamese
culture. It in ﬂuences the attitude, beliefs and behaviours of Vietnamese people in many
respects, including the status of education. This research found that generally social and
cultural values acted as a barrier restricting DLE development.
Social beliefs in education
Vu (2009) found that Vietnamese people believe having high academic quali ﬁcations will
make their lives better. Some managers, however, said that LIM practitioners attendedcontinuing education (CE) programmes because they wanted to get certi ﬁcates rather than
through a desire to obtain new knowledge.
Nguyen (2008) called them “degree hunters ”.A s
a result, it was hard for library managers to approve all staff requests to take CEDigital library
education
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
opportunities because they realised some staff preferred degree programmes that take a
long time to complete, were mostly focused on theory, and were costly. The emphasis on
theoretical knowledge comes from Confucianism and has sometimes hindered educational
change in Vietnam ( Vu Thu Hang et al.,2 0 1 5 ). Staff were sometimes unwilling to take short
courses that would train them in necessary DL skills. In other words, what these staff want
for themselves is often not what is best for the library.
Power distance
According to Hofstede (2001 , pp. 83, 97, 102), power distance (PD) is a cultural dimension
that re ﬂects the degree of inequality that exists and is accepted by the less powerful
members of a group, organisation, institution or society. He found that in a high PD
workplace, employees perceive managers as less approachable, communication ﬂows
downward and respect upward, while in a low PD workplace, employees perceive managers
as peers and are more willing to share ideas. Confucianism stresses a hierarchical order withits core objective being a stable and well-ordered society ( Berthrong and Berthrong, 2000 ).
The power distance (PD) aspect was identi ﬁed inside LIM organisations. The data show that
PD existed at the organisational level and this prevented LIM practitioners from proposing
their needs (especially educational needs) to their manager. Normally it is only the manager
who decides how and when staff need to improve their skills.
Viewpoint of society on the LIM ﬁeld
Views in society about the role of libraries and information centres were an important
barrier to the development of DLE. According to the participants, the LIM ﬁeld did not
receive attention, and people still thought that working in a library was a “simple job ”. This
led to LIM practitioners having little motivation for study because they thought that nothing
would change even after further training.
Personal and organisational nexus
The relationship between individual need and organisational need is a crucial factor
affecting organisational development ( Nowlen, 1988 ).
Interactions of learning needs
In this study, we found that the learning needs of LIM practitioners and those of LIM
organisations were closely related. LIM organisations needed staff with competencies to run
their IT systems. Individuals needed competencies to perform new tasks at work, and veryoften they needed the support of the organisation to take educational opportunities. This
intertwining of needs and expectations explains why the term “nexus ”is used.
Though LIM practitioners sometimes proposed their learning needs to managers, the
ﬁnal decision usually depended upon the managers believing that their organisations would
beneﬁt, rather than any consideration for the personal development of the staff. According
to
Nguyen (2008) , LIM managers in Vietnam have a strong effect on their staff ’s education.
She found that some demanding managers, to meet their organisation ’s need, forced staff to
attend CE programmes.
In this study, there were two types of relationships between individual and
organisational learning: con ﬂict relationships and balanced relationships. There was
conﬂict between LIM practitioners and their libraries in terms of the need for professional
development. As an example, in libraries not fully computerised some managers believed
their staff did not need DLE or any IT courses; however, many of their staff wanted toGKMC
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
attend DLE courses for their personal development. In balanced relationships, the learning
needs of the organisation matched those of LIM practitioners. Managers in these libraries
wanted to attract and keep quali ﬁed staff who could help their organisation change to the
digital environment, so they gave staff opportunities to further their education.
Research suggests that the need for organisational learning generally leads to the need
for individual learning, but Antonacopoulou (2006) found that individual learning does not
have a signi ﬁcant impact on organisational learning. This research discovered similar
results in LIM. This is signi ﬁcant for DLE because if LIM educators or change agents want
to develop an educational programme for LIM practitioners they will need to demonstrate
the organisational need for it to get agreement from LIM managers.
In the LIM academic setting, there was no con ﬂict on professional development of
lecturers and the organisational development of LIM schools, which is a positive factor fordeveloping DLE.
Change agents
In his Change Communication Model describing the environment of educational change,
Ellsworth (2000) situated change agents at the beginning of the process. They adopt a new
idea or innovation and try to spread it through their community. Given that DLE progresswas slow, it was worth asking what factors affected the efforts of change agents trying to
develop DLE.
Change agents as a positive factor
Change agents have played three crucial roles in DLE development in Vietnam:
(1) understanding the current situation within the LIM ﬁeld;
(2) exploring and promoting LIM educational needs; and
(3) advocating (and trying to initiate efforts) for change in LIM education. Change
agents had positive effects in all of these roles.
This research shows that leaders (managers, decision makers –ofﬁcials, chairpersons and
deans) often acted in isolation. In some cases, there was a lack of mutual respect amongthese stakeholders and they blamed each other for slow progress. There was little
cooperation among government departments, LIM associations, libraries and LIM schools.
In an attempt to overcome this, some change agents built relationships among theseagencies and encouraged leaders to work together to introduce innovations in the LIM ﬁeld.
The LIM associations did not have a strong impact on LIM professional practice and
education; however, these associations had varying degrees of impact on DLE development.
Change agents recognised this and worked with the LIM associations at the beginning of the
educational change process. LIM associations offered some DLE courses and/or educationalprogrammes that included DL subjects.
Change agents (themselves often opinion leaders) used other opinion leaders to promote
new ideas and change the attitudes of potential adopters. According to Rogers (2003),
“change agent success in securing adoption of innovations by clients is positively related to
the extent that he or she works through opinion leaders ”(p. 388). Research by
Valente and
Pumpuang (2007) andYoungsang et al. (2012) also demonstrated that opinion leaders have a
strong impact on the adoption of products or services in the diffusion of innovations. This
research shows that opinion leaders play an important role in promoting new LIMeducational programmes through workshops, conferences and library journals to in ﬂuence
stakeholders ’attitudes about DLs and DLE.Digital library

Barriers restricting change agents' e ﬀorts in developing DLE
In this study, we identi ﬁed PD as a major barrier to change agents' efforts in developing
DLE. Government management of educational programmes/curricula, for example, limited
the impact of change agents ’efforts to in ﬂuence stakeholder ’s development of DLE, which
can be ascribed to high PD in Vietnam. In Vietnamese society, a change agent needs to have
power in terms of her or his position, such as being a manager, dean or government of ﬁcial.
We found an example of a senior LIM staff member respected by other LIM practitionerswho published research on DLs, yet he could not in ﬂuence the LIM community because he
was not a manager.
Other barriers to change agents' efforts were government management; the viewpoint of
society about the LIM ﬁeld; the lack of lecturers for DLE; the lack of cooperation among
stakeholders; and stakeholders ’reluctance to change.
Model revision of contextual factors
Based on the results of the data analysis we revised the initial model. Figure 3
shows the
factors that have changed. There are several key changes between the initial model and the
ﬁnal model. First, the Social environment factor was divided into three factors: government,
IT infrastructure andsocial and culture values. The data indicate that the social environment
is a big and complex component, which upon analysis involved three separate factors within
the environment. IT infrastructure is a new factor that was not included in the initial model.
Second, the Stakeholders and their characteristics factor and a part of Digital library
profession were combined in a new Stakeholder attitudes factor. The reason for this
combination is that the attitudes of stakeholders towards digital libraries and the LIM
practitioners' viewpoints on digital competencies are similar, and both strongly affected the
development of DLE. Perceived requirements of the digital library profession were stated by
all stakeholders.
Figure 3.
Change betweeninitial model and
revised model

Third, the DLE needs factor was merged into the Characteristics of DLE factor because it
was already identi ﬁed as a characteristic of DLE. Therefore, to avoid repetition, they were
combined into one factor. Initially, the Digital library profession factor was de ﬁned as the
knowledge of and skills for LIM practitioners. The knowledge and skills were revealed bystakeholders through their expressions of educational need. The need is a part of theCharacteristics of DLE factor. Therefore, the Digital library profession factor was merged
into the Characteristics of DLE factor.
The original Personal and organisation development balance factor was renamed the
Personal and organisational nexus factor. The term “personal and organisational
development balance ”comes from the Nowlen model. It re ﬂected the idea that the
development needs of individuals should be similar to or a part of the organisation ’s needs.
The original term did not fully express the close and complex relationship between theprofessional development needs of LIM practitioners and the needs of their organisations;therefore, we have chosen Personal and organisational nexus to explain the nature of this
relationship more clearly.
The revised model
The seven major contextual factors affecting DLE development in the Vietnamese context
are grouped into three categories:
(1) external factors, which include government, IT infrastructure and social and
cultural values;
(2) internal factors, which include stakeholders ’attitudes, DLE characteristics, and the
personal and organisational nexus; and
(3) change agents, which is both an internal and external factor.
These factors had different levels of in ﬂuence on DLE development and are inter-related.
The factors are presented in Figure 4 .
Figure 4.

There was a signi ﬁcant change in terms of model presentation from the initial version. The
factors were initially depicted in a circle with three layers, but the ﬁnal model presents the
factors as separate entities with relationships indicated by linking arrows. The reason for
this change is because the revised model can present clearly three aspects that the former
missed. First, it can present LIM educational change as a process. Fullan (2007) viewed
educational change to be a process with three phases: initiation, implementation and
institutionalisation. In this study, we found DLE development in Vietnam to be in transition
moving slowly between the initiation and implementation phases. For example, althoughthe Vietnamese Government was supporting the development of the country's IT
infrastructure, LIM schools overall did not have the facilities nor the staff with the
competencies necessary for DLE. Second, the revised model illustrates the relationships
between factors as shown by the arrows. Finally, it shows both the direct and indirect effects
of the contextual factors on DLE development.
The “relationships ”arrows present the relationships between factors rather than the type
of relation. For example, the Change agents factor in ﬂuences the Government factor (policies
and funds) and the Stakeholder attitudes factor (LIM practitioner competencies). “Direct
effects ”illustrate that a factor directly affects DLE development. For example, the Change
agent factor directly affects policies and funds of the Government and in ﬂuences the
Stakeholder attitudes. “Indirect effects ”means that a factor affects the DLE development
through other factors. For instance, the Social and cultural values factor in ﬂuences DLE
development through affecting Stakeholder attitudes and the Personal and organisational
nexus .
Government
The Vietnamese Government is recognised as the most in ﬂuential factor affecting the
development of DLE in Vietnam. The government acted both as an enabler and as a barrier
with regard to the development of DLE. The Government factor has relationships with the
Change agents factor and the IT infrastructure factor. The government was affected by
change agents through their lobbying. Some change agents used their organisations to
inﬂuence the government in terms of developing standards, acquiring new technology and
changing LIM educational requirements. Change agents said that this was a good way to
deliver new technologies/LIM standards to the LIM ﬁeld in the Vietnamese environment in
which central planning plays a critical role. Change agents have been successful in the pastin approaching the relevant government ministries to promote the introduction of integrated
library systems and MARC21. In addition, they in ﬂuenced MOET to allow for basic LIM
educational programmes. Change agents thus were able to reduce the limiting effects of the
government ’s management control.
The government directly affected the development of the IT infrastructure through
policies that prioritised investment in IT that created a basic IT infrastructure for education
and other sectors. This created the environment required for the development of DLs and
DLE.
Change agents
This factor includes individual change agents and change organisations. The effects of
change agents on DLE were identi ﬁed through the enablers and hindrances. Change agents
were an enabling factor. They made efforts to deliver DLE into the LIM ﬁeld.
The Change agents factor has relationships with the Government factor and the
Stakeholder attitudes factor. The relationship with Government was discussed above. In theGKMC
Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
relationship with Stakeholder attitudes , change agents played an important role in positively
inﬂuencing stakeholders' opinions about DLs and DLE.
In Vietnam, as would be the case for many similar countries, the centralised diffusion
process (Rogers, 2003) is the most likely to succeed. Change agents work with the top level ofmanagement and in ﬂuence decision makers to decide whether the innovation (e.g. a new
software product, new technology, or new educational programme) should be introduced tothe LIM community.
Stakeholder attitudes
Stakeholder attitudes was one of the most important factors that affected the development of
DLE. This factor presented the current understanding and viewpoint about DLs and DLEand explored the needs of the LIM profession. This factor had both positive and negativeeffects on DLE development.
In its relationships with other factors, the Stakeholder attitudes factor was in ﬂuenced
both by Social and cultural values and by Change agents . According to
Wood (2000) , the
speed of the change process increases when the attitudes of stakeholders change. Therefore,an important ﬁnding in this study was that change agents believed that it was necessary to
help the various stakeholders to understand the DL concept, which in turn would help
change their attitudes towards the importance of DLE development. The Stakeholder
attitudes factor was also affected by the Social and cultural values factor.
Social and cultural values
TheSocial and cultural values factor was a barrier which restricted DLE development. The
aspects of this factor such as the attitudes in Vietnamese society to those in the LIM ﬁeld,
the lack of cooperation among LIM organisations, the stakeholders ’hesitation to change and
the power distance in society were barriers to DLE development.
In its relationship with other factors, the Social and cultural values factor affected the
Stakeholder attitudes factor (this was discussed above) and the Personal and organisational
nexus factor. Power distance, an aspect of the Social and cultural values factor, restricted LIM
practitioners stating their educational needs. This led to a “conﬂict”relationship between
individuals and organisations.
Personal and organisational nexus
This factor was both an enabler and a barrier. It has relationships with the Social and
cultural values factor and the DLE characteristics factor. The ﬁrst relationship was discussed
above. In its relationship with the DLE characteristics factor, the Personal and
organisational nexus affected the educational needs of LIM practitioners. It would prompt
DLE needs if it was a “balanced ”relationship, or restrict the need if it was a “conﬂict”
relationship.
Digital library education characteristics
This factor includes the need for DLE, the DLE content in current LIM educational
programmes, and the ability of LIM schools to develop and implement DLE. The factor wasboth an enabler and a barrier. The recognition of the need for DLE was an enabling factorfor DLE development, however, the lack of lecturers who could implement DLEprogrammes was a barrier for DLE development. This factor has a relationship with the
Personal and organisational nexus factor.Digital library

Downloaded by Göteborgs Universitet At 22:19 24 January 2019 (PT)
Information technology infrastructure
The development of a national digital environment, the trends in using digital content and
the need for staff to work in DLs, created the need for DLE. The IT infrastructure was anenabler for the development of DLE. The IT infrastructure factor was affected by theGovernment factor because of the impact of government policies and funding for IT.
In summary, the various factors had different levels of impact on DLE development.
Some factors played important roles in DLE development and in ﬂuenced other factors, while
others had less impact on the development. In addition, each factor does not stand alone,rather it has relationships with others, and together they affect DLE development.
Conclusion
The revised model with its seven major factors illustrates the context in which DLE in
Vietnam must try to grow. Some factors are enablers, some are barriers, and some are both.Those who are involved with DLE development in countries such as Vietnam, especially thechange agents, can use the model to help them understand what sorts of opportunities andchallenges they will face with each attempt to promote DLE. As an example, government isby far the most in ﬂuential contextual factor, yet it is both an enabler and a barrier, so it is
possible to use government as a positive force but necessary to bear in mind that it can alsooffer resistance to change. The model shows relationships between factors, so again takingthe example of government it can be seen that it affects the IT infrastructure. If governmentcan be encouraged to be supportive, it can improve the IT infrastructure that will become apositive factor for DLE development. The same use of relationships and direction ofinﬂuence can be used for all the factors to assist in DLE development.
Vietnam is not alone as a Southeast Asian country with a growing demand for LIM
graduates with the necessary competencies to work in and manage digital libraries.Therefore, the model developed in this study can potentially play an important role inunderstanding the factors affecting DLE development in other South East Asian countries.We invite researchers in these countries to replicate this study to further validate the model,thereby establishing it as a standard for the region.

Abstract  
This paper considers the implications of digital text production models for the development 
of reading materials for emergent and early readers in the Ethiopian context. We draw  from 
several theoretical frameworks and also from comments of Ethiopian academics, writers, 
and publishers to ground descriptions of Ethiopian contexts of language and literacy. We 
then present three different models for the production and curation of digital stories for 
children and contemplate how these models align with existing literacy traditions and 
practices. We also raise questions about the potential effects on the development of literary 
culture and children’s literature in Ethiopia of projects a imed at rapidly producing large 
corpora of literature for children. Ultimately, we pose complicated cultural and linguistic 
questions that need to be taken into consideration to provide appropriate and original early 
literacy materials in Ethiopia.

Introduction 
Low literacy rates in some majority world contexts are deemed problematic, 
particularly by the Euro -Western world, and have precipitated intervention in the form of 
literacy programs (Wickens & Sandlin, 2007). Such programs promote the use of digital 
texts as an essential component of urgently needed early literacy programs, primarily as a 
means to reduce publication costs and increase knowledge mobility ( United States Agency 
for International Development [USAID] , 2017). These recommendations are set against a 
backdrop of a history of donated, context -insensitive books from the Global North that 
have had little impact on access. Much of the digital material trickling down into the hands 
of children in the Global South are cultural and linguistic downloads from the same foreign 
publishers of donated print books, which raises ethical concerns about the appropriateness 
of texts for children and the development of a local culture of  children’s literature. And yet 
a small portion of new texts generated through emergent digital projects do originate 
internally with local writers, illustrators, and publishers —thereby promising more 
relevance.  Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 135  This paper considers the cultural, linguist ic, and technological implications of 
digital models of text production and curation with a particular focus on the Ethiopian 
context of language and literacy. To establish this context, we describe Ethiopia’s linguistic 
and cultural diversity, as well as Ethiopian traditions and practices around early reading, 
book culture, and storytelling. We then present analyses of digital book production projects 
producing storybooks for children in Ethiopian languages. Multiple theoretical framings 
inform our discuss ion of the deeply complex historical, political, religious, social, and 
economic context of Ethiopian language and literacy. It is this context that digital book 
production projects need to take into account  if the aim is to provide a means of access to 
original, culturally and linguistically relevant literacy materials for emergent and early 
readers in Ethiopia.  
We also include information and perspectives from Ethiopian academics, writers, and 
publishers, who emailed answers to a series of questions about their experiences with stories 
and their views of contemporary children’s reading materials in Ethiopia. Perspectives offered 
through the activities described above illustrate and extend descriptions of th e Ethiopian 
context of language and literacy derived from literature. Subsequently, we planned a focus 
group discussion with our seven participants about the implications and possibilities of digital 
book production at the College of Educational and Behavi oral Studies at Addis Ababa 
University. At the request of the Dean of the College, however, we changed the focus group 
structure to that of a presentation on a local digital book production project. This presentation 
was open to all faculty and graduate st udents. Comments and questions from attendees inform 
the second half of this paper. 
 
The Ethiopian Context: Literacy and Linguistic Diversity in Ethiopia 
According to the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation  
(UNESCO) Institute of Statistics (UIS, 2016), the rate of literacy in Ethiopia has 
dramatically increased over the past 25 years and continues to rise steadily. Figures 
published for 2015 suggest that almost 70% of youth are now literate (in comparison to a 
reported rate for  youth of less than 34% in 1994 and about 55% in 2007; see Table 1). Over 
the past few decades there has also been a marked increase reported in literacy rates among 
girls and women, to the point that the literacy gap between men and women between the 
ages of 15 and 24 is now reported to be less than 3% (see Table 2). Joshi and Verspoor 
(2012) observe that one impetus for change has been the goal set by the Ethiopian 
government of becoming a “middle -income country” by 2020 to 2023 ( MoFED, 2010) . 
Such a goal , Joshi and Verspoor note, is only possible in countries with high rates of 
literacy among both men and women and a sufficient number of secondary graduates to 
support a middle -income economy.

As acknowledged by the UIS itself, potential shortcomings of any set of national 
statistics such as those cited above relate to how literacy is defined and the methods by 
which literacy data is collected. In International Literacy Statistics: A Review of Concepts, 
Methodology and Current Data (UIS, 2008), author Roy Carr -Hill draws on the work of 
New Literacy Studies scholars in observing that literacy  
 
only has meaning within its particular context of social practice and does not transfer 
easily across contexts; there are different literacy practices in different domains of 
social life, such as education, religion, workplace, public services, and family and 
community activities. They change over tim e and these different literacies are 
supported and shaped by different institutions and social relationships. (UIS, 2008, 
p. 25)  
 
The question of how literacy rates have been defined and measured over the past 25 years 
in Ethiopia is beyond the scope of this paper; suffice it to say that the above statistics are 
offered with the caveat that they are not infallible. Collecting reliable literacy data in 
Ethiopia is challenging for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the nation is 
one of great linguistic and cultural diversity. In responding to the 2007 census, for example, 
citizens reported over 90 languages as mother tongues and identified themselves as 
belonging to over 85 distinct ethnic groups (Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2010). Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 137  In a working paper on the medium of instruction (MoI) in Ethiopian schools, Vujich 
(2013) offers an overview of key language poli cies over the past 75 years that have 
influenced literacy practices and achievement in school. Drawing on Getachew and Derib 
(2006), he notes that the “first official Ethiopian educational language policy emerged in 
1944 in the form of a directive that Amh aric was to be the general language of instruction,” 
and that in 1955 Amharic was also “made the official language in Ethiopia’s revised 
constitution, thus extending its use beyond the education sector to the political, legal, and 
administrative spheres” ( Vujich, 2013, p. 3). Notably, however, Amharic has never been 
the language of the majority in Ethiopia. Census data collected in 2007 shows that only 
29% of the population reported Amharic (or “Amaringa”) as a “mother tongue.” Afaan 
Oromo was in fact the m ost common reported mother tongue (34%), while the remainder 
of the population (37%) reported over 90 other languages as mother tongues ( Central 
Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2010) . Ultimately, the shift toward an Amharic -speaking 
state, which has been i nterpreted by historians as a nation- building and power -
consolidation effort on the part of then Emperor Haile Selassie (Getachew & Derib, 2006; 
Smith, 2008; Vujich, 2013), has led to a complex scenario whereby many Ethiopian 
children —particularly those in  regions where Amharic is not dominant (e.g., Oromia, the 
Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region [SNNP], Somali, and Tigraydid) —
have not had access to education in their first language. Further, at the same time Amharic 
was set as the medium of instruction (MoI) in early schooling, English was promoted as 
the MoI in upper primary and secondary schools, as well as in teacher training institutions 
(Heugh, Benson, Bogale, & Yohannes, 2007; Vijich, 2013) . This meant children had to 
learn yet anoth er language to gain access to upper elementary and secondary schooling.  
Vijich notes that while the “socialist- inspired revolution of 1974 resulted in a 
formal reversal of Selassie’s homogenising policies,” in practice, Amharic “remained the 
language of in struction in primary schools, principally because teachers most often spoke 
Amharic and were not trained in the use of local mother tongues” (Vijich, 2013, p. 3). The 
status quo—primary education in Amharic —was nevertheless gradually contested. Data 
collected by the ministry of education in the mid -1980s showed that performance in science 
and technology of students with Amharic as a mother tongue was markedly higher than 
that of students with other first languages, and the disadvantage of the MoI for non -
Amharic speakers was identified as a likely cause (Vijich, 2013).  
This perspective is in line with developing understandings of the importance of the 
mother tongue in education (see, for example, an extensive review of research on this topic 
in the recent L andscape Report on Early Grade Literacy [Kim, Boyle, Zuilkowski, & 
Nakamura, 2016]) . As Cummins (2001) observes,  
 
When the mother tongue is promoted in school . . . the concepts, language, and 
literacy skills that children are learning in the majority lang uage can transfer to the 
home language. In short, both languages nurture each other . . . Bilingual children 
perform better in school when the school effectively teaches the mother tongue and, 
where appropriate, develops literacy in that language. By contr ast, when children’s 
mother tongue is encouraged to atrophy and its development stagnates, children’s 
personal and conceptual foundation for learning is undermined. (Cummins, 2001, p. 
18) Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 138  Cummins further notes that the challenge for educators and policymakers in highly 
multilingual settings “is to shape the evolution of national identity in such a way that the 
rights of all citizens (including school children) are respected, and the cultural, linguistic, 
and economic resources of the nation are maximized” ( p. 18). To do other than offer 
education in the mother tongue, particularly to children attending school in the very 
communities their ancestors have inhabited for generations, violates the UN Convention on 
the Rights of the Child  (UNCRC), which states tha t education of children shall be directed 
toward the “development of respect for the child’s parents, his or her own cultural identity, 
[and] language and values,” and that a child “shall not be denied the right, in community 
with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and 
practise his or her own religion, or to use his or her own language” (United Nations, 1989, 
Articles 29.1.c and 30). The African Charter of Rights and Welfare of the Child, adopted 
in 1990 by the Or ganisation of African Unity, builds on the principles of the UNCRC—
also emphasizing that children’s education should include “the preservation and 
strengthening of positive African morals, traditional values, and cultures” (OAU, 1990, 
Article 11).  
In keepi ng with these perspectives, in 1994 a new policy emerged in Ethiopia 
guaranteeing children the right to primary education in their first language: “Cognizant of 
the pedagogical advantage of the child in learning in mother tongue and the rights of 
nationali ties to promote the use of their languages, primary education will be given in 
nationality languages” (Government of Ethiopia, 1994). Even now, however, the 
implementation of this policy remains challenging in areas of high linguistic diversity for 
a numbe r of reasons, including (1) the difficulty in finding teachers fluent in local 
languages; (2) the challenge of offering teacher training in those languages; (3) the paucity 
of reading materials suitable to the context; and (4) the expense of translation when local 
reading materials are not available. In the next section of this paper we focus on the third 
of these challenges —the paucity of reading materials —considering in particular the 
availability of storybooks that might support early literacy development.  
 
Early Reading, Book Culture, and Storytelling in Ethiopia  
Many researchers have argued that early literacy acquisition is best supported by 
the extensive reading of storybooks, particularly those that are closely connected to 
children’s home and community environments. Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems 
theory ( 1979; Bronfenbrenner & Morris , 2007), for example, explains the interplay of 
various embedded contexts (e.g., social, legal, economic, and religious) on human 
development. For young children’s development, the most immediate and influential 
environment is the microsystem, consisting of the child’s family and close community. 
Applying this perspective to the selection of early reading materials for children, it is 
widely acknowledged that the stories children hear and learn to read should include those 
in wh ich they can see themselves and their worlds —the microsystem. Such stories are 
those that describe characters with whom children can easily relate engaging in 
recognizable activities, such as familiar childhood games or customary family and 
community pract ices. As development progresses, early childhood educators scaffold 
children’s reading materials to extend beyond immediate family and community contexts. 
Acknowledging and drawing on children’s funds of knowledge (Moll & Greenberg, 
1990) in early learning  settings respectfully and effectively supports literacy development, Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 139  especially with children of diversity (Moll & Gonzalez, 1994). Moll and his colleagues 
define funds of knowledge as “those historically accumulated and culturally developed 
bodies of knowledge and skills essential for household or individual functioning and 
wellbeing” (Moll & Gonzalez, 1994, p. 443). Similarly , the schema theory of reading 
proposed by Anderson and Pearson (1984) posits that comprehension requires the ability 
to relate reading or viewing to one’s own schema or knowledge, which includes content 
knowledge and knowledge of textual forms. Recognizing the funds of knowledge and 
schemata students bring to classroom settings and providing reading materials that are both 
linguistic ally meaningful and culturally relevant allows beginning readers not only to 
identify with characters, settings, and events, but also to understand vocabulary and cultural 
themes. Thus, along with the rise of multicultural children’s picture books have bee n 
discussions of cultural authenticity —in relation to both written content and illustrations 
(Fox & Short, 2003). Although some argue for specific definitions, Smith and Wiese 
(2006) broadly define cultural authenticity as “the extent to which the reteller , adaptor, or 
illustrator (1) remains reasonably true to the original printed source, (2) accurately and 
respectfully represents the values and beliefs of the cultural group, and (3) responsibly 
depicts geographical, historical, and cultural details” (p. 72).  
In the Ethiopian context, there is not a long tradition of the publication of the sorts 
of early reading materials described above—that is, illustrated books for children. This is 
not because there is no history of literacy and book production in Ethiopia. On the contrary, 
as Winslow (2015) observes, the Ethiopian tradition of manuscript production is one of the 
longest in the world, and scribal practices that are centuries old are still practiced where 
they have been lost elsewhere: “ Isolationist for a  period of almost 700 years due to 
geopolitical and religious factors, [Ethiopia] has preserved many practices intact from the 
medieval period, including the production of parchment manuscripts” (p. 1). Consequently, 
Winslow remarks, contemporary scholars of manuscript culture look to Ethiopia for an 
understanding of medieval book production techniques .

Lalibela. Photos: T.M. Dobson personal archives, 2010. 
 
Historically, the primary script used for manuscript production in Ethiopia was 
Ge’ez, a language for writing liturgical, scholarly, and literary work that is no longer in 
Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 140  general use beyond t he church ( Scelta & Quezzaire- Belle, 2001) . Elsewhere, in most 
settings outside the church, communications were in oral form. Notes McCann (2001), “ the 
written form as a bureaucratic exercise did not supplant the oral tradition until well into the 
modern era” (p. 85) . Not surprisingly, therefore, book culture in Ethiopia is still strongly 
tied to its liturgical and scholarly origins, and books are serious objects for serious content 
(Figure 1). Publishing storybooks  for children is a unique notion for many  in Ethiopia. 
Storytelling for children instead remains a primarily oral genre. In an effort to get 
a sense of perspectives on and experiences with early literacy texts in Ethiopia, we sought 
input from seven Ethiopian citizens involved in education and book production. These 
participants, all professionals, included a member of an NGO working in early literacy 
projects, university faculty in education, an author of children’s books in major indigenous 
Ethiopian languages, and a local publisher. Planned Sky pe interviews were not possible 
due to challenges with connectivity, so participants answered questions via email. Asked 
about the most common types of stories in their own homes growing up, they listed riddles , 
songs, indoor and outdoor games , animal stor ies, and fables . 
The functions of these stories, according to one participant, are “to teach kids how to 
socialize, to make critical thinkers, learn manners, and to entertain. Riddles, for instance, 
help children to think critically” (Participant: NGO Memb er). Another intimated that 
storytelling is primarily didactic in nature. Children are expected to attend carefully during 
storytelling sessions, right up to the point that the message is made clear:  
 
Grandparents are more willing than parents to tell stor ies to children. When a 
grandparent tells a story, children sit around her/him and listen. Usually they sit 
rounding the fireplace in home. When the teller tells orally from his/her memory, 
children listen with strict discipline. They can smile, gesture, a nd even laugh. But 
they do not shout, move from place to place, and push each other. They listen until 
the teller finishes and tells message of the story. (Participant: Professor of Childhood 
Studies)  
 
Participants identified the tellers of these stories a s family and community members, 
including grandmothers, mothers, fathers, uncles, aunts, and neighbours. One participant 
remarked that siblings also tell the stories to one another, a point that is also emphasized 
by Jirata (2013) in his work on the oral t radition among the Guji -Oromo in Southern 
Ethiopia. Most remarked that the stories they recall were told orally from memory, 
regularly in the evening before bed. One reported hearing stories through radio and 
television, observing “there was a popular stor yteller called Ababa Tesfaye on a TV 
children’s show in my time” (Participant: Publisher).  
Another participant, a published Ethiopian YA author who responded to our 
questions via email, captured the richness of storytelling sessions by noting the different  
environments in which his mother and father orated:  
 
My father came from an Oromo family and he used to tell us about his home town, 
and my mother came from Amhara family and she used to tell us about her home 
town. 
In Ethiopia extended coffee ceremony is  common and neighbors are called as 
most house wives are around and find excuses to start telling about it. Sometimes my Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 141  mother speaks about the same story again and again. I had a very strong 
grandmother —even neighbors were afraid of her. Most believed she was more than 
100 years old. She was like a legend. My mother told stories about her 
grandmother —passed away at 118 years old. Unsure though as no birth certificates —
could get clues of her age by what she spoke about (historically). Even men were 
afraid of her. She was very logical. She was part of a relatively well off countryside 
family. She was very bossy and supervised the men over their work. She was ahead 
of her time by assuming the responsibility herself for men’s work and anyone’s work. 
She remain s center topic of stories today.  
My father had a business and my siblings and I used to go to where the restaurant 
business is located. He used to tell stories about his home town not necessarily for us 
but for customers and others. Then we used to listen what he had to say. Father was 
Oromo —when he came to the city he suffered exploitation. He started a restaurant 
business in Addis and was forced to change his name to Amharic to get customers. 
His wife was Amharic —at the time, this was a cultural no -no to give a daughter to 
an Oromo man. From my father’s stories I learned about things more indirectly than 
directly as he wasn’t necessarily talking to me but to his customers and friends and I 
would be around pretending to play but also listening. (Participant : Ethiopian Writer; 
no editorial changes have been made to these notes)  
 
Notably, in keeping with the Ecological Systems Theory discussed earlier, which stresses 
the immediacy and import of the microsystem, the stories alluded to here are of hometowns 
and important people therein. Over the lengthy process of preparing coffee —roasting, 
grinding, boiling, filtering, pouring —the women “find excuses to start telling about it, ” the 
neuter pronoun here presumably referring to the recurring story of the legendary 
grandmother and her prescient behaviours that pushed the boundaries of ge nder roles. The 
story is not explicitly didactic and formal, as is the case in another participant’s earlier 
description of children sitting attentively and waiting for the “message.” Nor are the 
father’s stories examples of direct instruction specifically  intended for children; rather, 
children glean from these adult stories by eavesdropping while pretending to play.  
If we view emergent and early reading materials as most appropriate when they 
reflect the microsystem, then it stands to reason that initial efforts at publishing children’s 
literature in Ethiopia have drawn on the stories of the oral tradition commonly told in the 
home and community. When we asked our participants to list appropriate subjects or topics 
for young children’s books, they proposed that literature for early reading should be about 
animals, the environment or surroundings (e.g., trees, rivers, etc.), holidays, “people in the 
localities,” stories with morals, and “the common story topics.” Regarding to the last 
suggestion, the partici pant in question named several Ethiopian fables that are recognizable 
as part of the oral tradition, including a biblical tale: “The Monkey and the Lion,” “The 
Wise Man and Foolish Man,” and “The Clever Children.”  
In writing about the oral tradition of th e Guji -Oromo in southern Ethiopia, Jirata 
(2013) notes:  
 
The concept of “oral practice” signifies oral tradition as comprising cultural genres 
that include myths, legends, folktales, jokes, proverbs, riddles, chants, blessings, 
curses, insults, folk songs and folk beliefs. The concept of “oral process” denotes oral Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 142  tradition as events of social interaction and entails performances such storytelling, 
riddling, singing, dancing, joking, and chanting. Thus, oral tradition can be 
understood as cultural practices produced and reproduced through oral interactions. 
(p. 4)  
 
Given this complexity, story forms for very young children, which by necessity are orally 
transmitted, are regularly the last to make the transition to writing in any culture and are 
still deemed nascent in many traditions of writing (e.g., Salisbury &  Styles, 2012). A 
reticence to render such oral practices into writing in any context stems at least partially 
from the fact that performative elements are difficult, if not impossible, to transmediate. 
The bridge from oral to written forms is made in children’s books to some degree through 
a reliance on illustration to support and extend verbal content. This multimodal element of 
children’s texts inevitably becomes a factor in the cost and ease of their production, both 
in print and digital environments. In the next section, we discuss several initiatives having 
an impact on access to early storybooks in Ethiopia. 
 
Digital Texts for Young Readers in Ethiopia 
As noted earlier, we hoped to plan a follow -up focus group session with our seven 
participants at Ad dis Ababa University in May, 2016; however, we were asked by the Dean 
to open the session to all faculty and students, and to convert the format to a more formal 
presentation on the production of digital books for early literacy  in Ethiopia. Thirteen 
facul ty and graduate students —in fields related to education and early childhood 
development —along with one NGO representative attended our May, 2016 workshop, 
“Consideration for the Production of Digital Books for Early Literacy in Majority World 
Contexts.” In this presentation, we contemplated the ways literacy is being fostered, 
particularly in reference to the lack of readily available children’s storybooks in Ethiopian 
indigenous languages. We also introduced three approaches to digital access that may lead  
to increased availability of early reading materials: (1) the International Children’s Digital 
Library (ICDL); (2) the CODE Ethiopia Digital Books and Family Literacy Project; and 
(3) two crowdsourcing projects aimed at generating large multilingual digital corpora —
namely, Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project. Because the seminar room did 
not have connectivity, we presented all these projects as screen captures via a data 
projector. Below is a discussion of these projects in consideration of the  responses from 
our workshop participant group.  
 
The International Children’s Digital Library (ICDL) . The ICDL is an open- access 
curated collection of books that is primarily designed as a read -only platform. The ICDL 
goal, as stated on their website,  
 
is to build a collection . . . that represents outstanding historical and contemporary 
books from throughout the world. Ultimately, the Foundation aspires to have every 
culture and language represented so that every child can know and appreciate the 
riches o f children’s literature from the world community. ( International Children’s 
Digital Library , 2017, para. 3)  
 Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 143  With 4,619 volumes in 59 languages, this project, having launched in November 2002, is 
about halfway to the stated goal of collecting 10,000 volume s in 100 languages (Druin et 
al., 2003; ICDL, 2017). Users are not invited to author stories, although they can add 
metadata to existing stories in the form of keyword tags. The ICDL Collection 
Development Policy (2005) makes clear that the primary focus i s making available existing 
published volumes that are  
 
- currently available in print and within copyright;  
- out of print but within the copyright protection of the country in which they were 
published; or  
- freely available in the public domain; there  is no explicit solicitation for new 
materials. (International Children’s Digital Library, 2005)  
 
In other words, this is primarily a print digitization project geared toward creating an open 
educational resource in the form of a digital corpus of previous ly published children’s 
books in multiple languages.  
The ICDL was prescient in terms of recognizing the need for a resource of this type; 
however, the requirement of negotiating copyright for most of the volumes added slows 
the growth of the collection—at a time when there is immediate need for early reading 
materials in some contexts. Additionally, by collecting already published work, the project 
is not aimed at the root problem discussed earlier —that there are few if any published 
storybooks in many lang uages used as a MoI in early education within and beyond 
Ethiopia. At the time of writing this paper, there were only two books listed by country as 
“Ethiopian” in the ICDL. Both—Fafi’s Sheep  and Lion’s Tale —are traditional stories in 
Amharic that were ori ginally published (in 2005 and 2006, respectively) by the Ethiopian 
Books for Children and Educational Foundation. 
 
The CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project. The second project we 
introduced was the CODE Ethiopia eBooks and Family Literacy Project. This began as a 
small- scale pilot, intended to complement national reform in education aimed at improving 
access and equity in early childhood care and education (Et hiopian Ministry of Education, 
2016). The project initially targeted children aged 3 to 6 and their families in three rural 
areas where appropriate reading materials for the target group were unavailable. The 
primary objectives were to develop culturally a nd linguistically meaningful early reading 
materials written and illustrated by local writers and artists; to provide access to and guided 
experience with the texts in a family literacy program; and to invite communities to write 
stories relevant to their contexts, thereby fostering an interest in the writing of stories within 
communities (Abebe, 2015; Asselin, Dorion, & Abebe, 2015; CODE Ethiopia, 2015).  
Ethiopia -based librarians, writers, and CODE Ethiopia members initially selected 
six stories common to  the oral tradition. Abebe (2015) notes that these were made available 
in two local languages, Amharic and Afaan Oromo, and that the themes of the stories 
“related to animals, school life, and friendship” (n.p.). Notably, most are moral or religious 
tales with a strong didactic element. Colonial influence in the Ethiopian oral tradition is 
also evident in the selection of Wondime Yakob (Brother Jacob or  Frère Jacques ), 
described on the project site as the “Amharic version” of the well known French nursery 
rhyme with a melody that is “almost the same as the French one” (CODE Ethiopia, 2015). Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 144  Although the rhyme is heavily adapted to the point that it is dissimilar to the original rhyme 
in most respects, the story describes the morning routine of a brother and sister who wake 
each other up and later go to school to acquire knowledge.  
Although this CODE Ethiopia pilot work was initially couched as a digital book 
project, the book production model is consistent with contemporary approaches to print 
publication. CO DE Ethiopia deemed a dual -platform approach a necessity —that is, all 
books must be produced in such a way that multiple copies of each text can be distributed 
in either print or digital formats. In this respect, a conventional design approach for 
Western m onographs is employed: Books are construed as artefacts with a title page, front 
matter, and multiple pages featuring text and image with margins (see Figure 2). Printed 
versions can be produced quickly —for home reading or if hardware or power fails —via 
photocopier (see Figure 3). Given this model, there is limited opportunity to explore the 
multimodal affordances of digital platforms —affordances such as audio and video features 
that might be better suited to a setting with a strong oral tradition. Instead,  the bulk of 
digital materials produced might be described as “print adaptations” (Joyce, 1996). Both 
print and digital versions of the books produced in the context of this project are distributed 
under a Creative Commons Attribution- NonCommercial license.

Waggaa fi Daaimman ). 
 
Beyond production of the six books, there was a focus on building a corpus of 
context -sensitive texts by inviting each  of the three communities involved in the pilot to 
contribute two stories commonly told in their own contexts. CODE Ethiopia selected and 
edited three of the resulting stories and had them illustrated by the project illustrator, 
Atilabachew Reda. Original books from this project, along with the three contributed by 
communities, have now been translated into six Ethiopian languages. Each translation was 
treated with extreme care for sensitivity to context, including attendance to local dialects 
and customs, as well as reworking of illustrations to reflect local settings. Consider, for 
example, three unique covers for the Amharic, Afaan Oromo, and Somali versions of New 
Year and Children (Figures 4 –6). The nine books have been prepared in PDF formats and 
are loaded onto tablets for use in ongoing literacy projects managed by CODE Ethiopia. 
They have also been acquired by the African Storybook Project. Those who attended the 
session commented favourably on this project and the demonstrable feasibility of the 
approach with regard to future literacy and collection- building endeavours.

Outsourcing to the c rowd: Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project . The 
third and fourth approach we introduced were crowdsourcing initiatives that harness the 
collective wisdom of communities in the quest to develop large corpora rapidly —
specifically, Bloom Library and the African Storybook Project (ASb). Both projects a llow 
users to read, download, translate, and create stories. Like ICDL, Bloom has a global scope, 
while ASb has an African focus. Bloom sets out the problem that both projects aim to 
address on its splash page, observing that literacy educators are regular ly faced with too 
few books in localized indigenous language settings to successfully foster literacy:  
 
We know that it takes stacks  of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the 
practice needed to develop true literacy. The problem has been who will make all 
those books? How will we find the time? Where will we get the content? So we 
settle for the possible and hope for the best. (Bloom Library, 2017, para. 1)  
 
Therefore, a key challenge addressed by such projects —similar to the CODE Ethiopia 
project —is building interest in story writing and the capacity for bookmaking in local 
communities where collections of reading materials are  not available. To this end, “Bloom 
dramatically lowers the bar” by providing simple -to-use software and a range of book 
templates —“so that many more people can get involved in building a large collection of 
local language books” (Bloom Library, 2017).  
Data from the Internet Archive show that Bloom Library and ASb were launched at 
roughly the same time. (The Archive shows Bloom Library had launched at 
bloomlibrary.org by July, 2014; meanwhile, by September, 2013, ASb had launched a 
preliminary site announc ing its initiative at africanstorybook.org, and provided a site with 
functionality for users by May, 2014.) Both projects have since collected many volumes —
1,151 in the case of Bloom Library and almost 4,000 in the case of ASb. ( Unlike ICDL and 
Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 148  Bloom Libra ry, there is not a readily apparent count of the total number of books on ASb, 
although up until 1 April, 2017, it was possible to estimate —based on summing the totals 
in each category and assuming books did not regularly appear in multiple categories.)  
The slower growth of Bloom Library despite its global scope is likely a matter of 
accessibility. Bloom Library requires users to download software before reading and 
uploading stories, and this software is only available for PC and Linux standalone 
computers . For creators, Bloom Library also recommends the installation of “The Art of 
Reading,” a curated collection of line drawings, fonts, and a typing script for creators who 
do not have a way to type their own language. The fact that a download is required to create 
and read —and that there is no compatibility for the Mac OS —undoubtedly reduces the 
number of users of and contributors to the Bloom Library. Nevertheless, this approach 
evidently does have benefits; for instance, it offers a way for users to create  offline, which 
is a major consideration for settings with unreliable Internet access. ASb, on the other hand, 
has circumvented such platform wars by opting for a web application based on JavaScript 
and hosted in a Drupal shell. No registration or local software is required to read or 
download ASb books. The only potential impediment to submit or version (i.e., translate) 
a story is the creation of an account. Thus the ASb collection, having removed all barriers 
to access other than connectivity, is growing  most rapidly of all. It is also noteworthy that 
strong promotion of translation or versioning by the ASb has contributed to the rapid 
growth of its corpus, a point to which we will return. 
Both the Bloom Library and ASb growth rates eclipse that of the pr ojects discussed 
earlier (recall that it has taken the ICDL 15 years to collect 4,619 volumes). Clearly the 
“possible” described by Bloom Library, in opting for crowdsourcing over curation, is 
coming to fruition; what is less clear is whether their “hope f or the best” in taking this 
approach is being realized. As Porcello and  Hsi (2013) note in speaking of the variable 
quality of open educational resources (OER), there are benefits and drawbacks to 
crowdsourcing approaches:  
 
On one hand, collections using c rowdsourcing allow a wide range of online users to 
contribute, choosing their own descriptions and keywords to catalog, review, and 
manage OERs. This can produce large and loose collections. Although dedicated 
users from the resulting online communities might be more willing to detail their 
instructional experiences and personal connections to OERs, overall quality may be 
quite variable. On the other hand, having professional staff with disciplinary 
expertise populate, catalog, and maintain curated collecti ons usually results in fine -
tuned, coherent, and smaller collections. Although these collections grow more 
slowly, often with less vocal user communities, they can quickly respond to new 
quality or educational standards. ( Porcello &  Hsi, 2013, p. 240)  
 
As we considered the possibilities of the crowdsourcing projects for the Ethiopian context 
with those in attendance, the question of reimagining texts for different contexts through 
versioning and adaptation became a main point of interest. 
At the time of our  presentation in Addis Ababa, there were no volumes in Ethiopian 
languages in the Bloom Library collection; this continues to be the case. There was, 
however, a growing collection of books on ASb. As noted earlier, connectivity was 
unavailable for our workshop, so we selected four Amharic books as examples and Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 149  included representative screen captures within our presentation. These were as follows: (1) 
Fantu and her Plan,  a CODE Ethiopia book with which the group was familiar; (2) How 
Many?, a counting book w ith simple sketches of insects, birds, and mammals; (3) The Girl 
Who Got Rich, a moral story about two poor, hungry sisters who separately encounter a 
leper woman with magical powers and receive different fates in accordance with their 
treatment of her; an d (4) I Like to Read,  a simple text for early readers about a boy who 
enjoys reading and wanders about his home trying to find family members with whom he 
can share his story.  
Beyond the CODE Ethiopia text, all of the above books are versioned from other 
languages not indigenous to Ethiopia. The counting book, How Many?—written by Clare 
Verbeek, Thembani Dladla, and Zanele Buthelezi and illustrated by Sandra McDougall —
first appeared in Zulu. It was originally produced through the Seed Books project of the 
School of Education and Development and the Centre for Adult Education at the University 
of KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa. The Girl Who Got Rich is by Ugandan author Salaama 
Wanale, written in Lumasaaba and versioned by the same author to Amharic. The 
illustr ations are attributed to “Mango Tree,” which is apparently  “Mango Tree Educational 
Enterprises,” a Ugandan educational consulting firm (L. Doherty, personal 
communication, 14 March 2017). Finally, I Like to Read is written by Letta Machogo in 
Sepedi, with illustrations by Wiehan de Jager, both of South Africa. The Amharic 
translation is by Sehin Tefera and Mezemir Girma.  
 
I Like to Read: One example of versioning for the Ethiopian context . Of the four 
texts, the first three drew little in the way of comment or response. The group was familiar 
with the CODE Ethiopia text. The second two texts, How Many? and The Girl Who Got 
Rich, depicted items or settings that were familiar (local animals in  the first case and the 
traditional tukal homes, common in East Africa, in the latter). The fourth text, I Like to 
Read , drew an audible gasp of surprise. What garnered the group’s attention was not the 
story, but the illustrations. The cover and first pag e spread show a smartly dressed boy in 
a well -appointed home. He is seated in an orange upholstered chair, next to which is a leafy 
plant in a large vase. A landscape painting hangs on the vibrant green wall behind him, and 
it appears there is wall -to-wall carpeting on the floor. “I like to read,” or “I like reading,” 
declares the boy (see Figure 7). On the second page spread he stands at the door of his baby 
sister’s room. He is searching for someone with whom he can read. The baby is sleeping 
soundly in a  white crib, a large soother in her mouth. A mobile comprised of smiling stars 
hangs above the crib. The walls appear to be papered in pink, with a cloud wall appliqué 
positioned next to the crib. “Who can I read to?” the boy asks (see Figure 8).

Those in attendance were not familiar with the crowdsourcing approach of the ASb 
that results in stories migrating across contexts through versioning or adaptation. At first 
glance, it would be easy for any reader to overlook metadata and surmise that a story 
written in Amharic should be of Ethiopian origin. But the images, so clearly  not reflecting 
Ethiopian settings, made the book untenable and created discomfort.  
The illustrations are by Wiehan de Jager, a designer from Cape Town, South Africa. 
They reflect mixed design elements, mostly of European origin, from Colonial Revival 
Style (e.g., machine- milled trim and moulding) to Mid -Century Modern (e.g., simple lines, 
geometric patterns, and aesthetic contrast). In Ethiopian homes, however, such design 
features —wallpaper, mouldings, carpeting, mobiles, cribs, and so on— are rare. Many 
homes, especially in rural areas, are “constructed with mud -plastered wooden walls and 
grass roofs,” and a single room may serve for “ sleeping, keeping all household belongings, 
cooking and dining, keeping warm by burning wood, and also for tethering domes tic 
animals at night” (Animut, Balkew, & Lindtjørn, 2013, p. 2).  A 2011 study showed that 
85% of Ethiopian homes have flooring of earth and sand or dung, and that 70% use one 
room for sleeping. Family beds are the norm. Only 19% of rural households have pi ped 
Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 151  water and 5% of rural households have electricity. Toilets are often shared among several 
households, even in urban settings  (Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2012 , p. 16).  
This reality stands in contrast to the domestic spaces pictured by Wieh an de Jager 
in I Like to Read . He depicts the protagonist wandering through a home comprised of 
multiple rooms —a living room, nursery, and kitchen—before venturing  out to the front of 
the house, where he finds men fixing a car on a paved driveway (Figure 9). This last detail 
is also incongruent with local context, in consideration of the fact that Ethiopia stands near 
the bottom of the cars -per-capita list globally at 2 or 3 vehicles per 1,000 people (e.g., 
Deloitte, 2016, p. 7).  
 
 
Figure 9. I Like to Rea d, seventh page spread.  
 
Illustrations from I Like to Read  provoked comment among presentation attendees 
about the disjuncture between such images and the reality of Ethiopian settings. 
Participants discussed the challenge of finding a balance between generating culturally 
sensitive reading materials and steering clear of ethnocentrism. One individual emphasized 
that texts should be reflective of and consistent with the particular social context of the 
intended readership. Another agreed, stipulating that w hen children learn to read, it must 
be with culturally relevant materials. There was a clear aversion among many present to 
the concept of generic “readers” (texts designed for learning to read) in contrast to 
authentic, context specific stories. Yet one p erson presented another perspective, 
suggesting that stories serve as means of socialization and can be viewed as vehicles of 
ethnocentrism. This prompted the question: “To what extent should or can stories be bias 
or culture -free?” One speaker argued for the merit of stories designed for literacy learning 
that are transferable across cultures, while another suggested stories such as I Like to Read  
are not artefacts of bias but evidence of Ethiopia’s diversity. Still another claimed that 
ethnocentrism is sy stemic and that an exclusive focus on culturally sensitive texts would 
further promote this perspective.  
In considering these responses, it is important to note that the presentation attendees 
were unaware the story was versioned rather than an original w ork in Amharic. Evaluating 
books from various projects was not the focus of the session; the aim, rather, was to put 
forth more broadly the affordances of digital means of knowledge mobilization for early 
Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 152  literacy education in the Ethiopian context. In making book selections, therefore, we did 
not attend to which stories were versioned and which were originally in Amharic, intending 
merely to flick through screen captures to show that a number of Amharic books were 
available and then to invite attendees to look at the ASb site themselves (a plan the lack of 
connectivity in our seminar room prevented). Ultimately, however, we would suggest it is 
very likely that many ASb readers who make keyword searches for stories in particular 
target languages will not be aware if they encounter “unique” or “versioned” stories. 
Without the presence of clear statements indicating the versioning history of the 
narrative—story biographies, if you will —it would be easy for those readers not attuned to 
the way in which the corpus is produced to overlook metadata and, like our audience, find 
an unexpected disjuncture between the context suggested by the text and the context 
suggested by the illustrations.  
In a report on the African Storybook Project, Welch and Glennie (2016a) sta te that 
versioned stories make up the bulk of the corpus. End- of-month statistics from January 
through June 2015 show the ratio of the number of versioned stories to the number of 
unique stories is consistently greater than 3 to 1 (p. 202). I Like to Read  alone had been 
versioned 35 times at the time of the writing of this paper into a range of languages 
indigenous to Africa and otherwise. Furthermore, the story is typically translated not from 
the Sepedi version, which is given the status of being the orig inal story, but from one of 
two English instantiations. Both are also by the story author, Letta Machoga, but have slight 
lexical variations: I Like to Read and I Love to Read . (Notably, our analysis of the versions 
of I Like to Read  was completed before changes to the ASb interface, effected in early 
April 2017, buried the site metadata, at least for the moment, to the point that it is no longer 
possible to trace the versioning history of stories.)  
Welch and Glennie (2016a) explain that the ASb has activel y pursued translation 
as an effective way to build the corpus, noting that each story can be translated into 
“multiple languages for no cost” and that “workshops with local language speakers have 
proved very effective” (p. 203). They remark in particular on a successful translation 
workshop with 24 participants that produced “65 versions of seven existing stories” (p. 
203). In many ways, this is an exciting initiative. In an ASb blog post on versioning, Dorcus 
Wepukhulu, Kenya -based coordinator for the ASb, observes that translation workshop 
participants become involved in complex discussions about matters of translation, 
pondering appropriateness to context, text level, and so on. They consider, for example, 
whether they are engaging in translation or adapt ation, depending on the extent of the 
nature of changes to the text (e.g., whether the aim is to stay as close to original narrative 
as possible or to adapt for context suitability). They grapple with dialects and regional 
preferences, as well as with the appropriateness of oral or written constructions 
(Wepukhulu, 2016). The language work described by Wepukhulu is clearly careful, but the 
matter of how illustrations are managed through the process of versioning is worrisome. 
Wepukhulu ends her writing pondering this dilemma:  
 
There is the issue of whether I can adapt the text and retain the illustrations or could 
I adapt illustrations and retain the text? At the moment it is not possible to do the 
latter. How can I adapt actions/events in a story without having to adapt illustrations 
. . . ? (Wepukhulu, 2016, n.p.)  Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 153  As we have seen in consideration of I Like to Read , the question is broader than this. Even 
if the translation reflects the source very closely —that is to say, if actions and events are 
unaltered  to the extent that this is possible in translation —a failure to bring illustrations in 
line with the intended context could derail meaning for young readers.  
In texts for emergent and early readers, illustrations are integral to meaning making. 
There is much research in this area that is beyond the scope of this paper; suffice it to say 
that picture books work through the integration of visual and verbal meanings (e.g., Painter, 
Martin, & Unsworth, 2013). E mergent readers use pictures as primary clues to construct 
meaning and may benefit from texts in which images reinforce the verbal meaning (e.g., 
Anderson, Hiebert, Scott & Wilkenson, 1985; Clay, 1993; Harste, Woodward, & Burke, 
1984). Books for more advanced readers may evidence increasingly complex use s of 
illustration to reinforce, extend, or interrogate the verbal aspects of the text (Evans, 2015).  
In spite of a wealth of knowledge about the critical role of images in children’s literature, 
both crowdsourcing projects appear to privilege the verbal ov er the visual elements by 
relying on stock illustrations or promoting image reuse. Bloom Library, a project of global 
scale, offers a curated collection of line drawings, The Art of Reading: “ This free collection 
contains more than 10,000 line drawings sui table for use in reading materials” (Bloom 
Library, 2017). ASb has offered a cost -benefit analysis for image reuse:  
 
An important additional dimension is that it is possible to produce these storybooks 
at a fraction of the cost of original titles because t he illustrations are re -usable, and 
the digital tools exist for publishing of a translation in the same format. The African 
Storybook commissions high quality digital illustrations at an average cost of USD 
100 per 12 -page book. Each translation and adapta tion makes use of the same 
illustrations. So the initial investment in the book is spread across the 20 or more 
versions of the book that are created. In addition, the professional illustrations are 
stored in the African Storybook image bank and can be use d not only for translations 
and adaptations of a storybook, but combined to create new storybooks. (Welch & 
Glennie, 2016b, p. 4)  
 
Although ASb project members report that the stories are “written and illustrated by 
Africans” (Stranger -Johannessen, 2017, p. 27), it is not clear that this is in fact the case.  
Listed illustrators for some books, for instance, are widely accessible image banks and 
Internet image search engines such as Google. Even in the case that illustrators and writers 
are African, the ques tion remains as to whether these illustrations and writings are 
transportable across the exceedingly diverse continent that is Africa, as we have seen in the 
case of I Like to Read . Are the drawings of Weihan De Jager, a white designer and specialist 
in co rporate branding living in South Africa, relevant in settings associated with the many 
languages into which the book has now been translated? Suggesting this should be the case, 
as intimated in the cost analysis above, seems dangerously close to the sort of one -size-
fits-all racial, ethnic, territorial or geopolitical essentialism that has long plagued Africa —
putting what is clearly a valuable project in danger of being cast as an engine of neo-
colonialism. Most certainly this cost- saving strategy runs counter to the ASb goal: 
“Children need to have books in a familiar language, with stories that reflect their context 
and experience, as well as their hopes for the future, so that they can connect with them 
emotionally” (Welch & Glennie, 2016a, p. 195).  Language and Literacy                       Volume 20, Issue 3, 2018                            Page 154  It is not our intent to dismiss the important work of Bloom Library or the ASb, but 
rather to enter into a conversation about the benefits and drawbacks of various 
methodologies for building a corpus of early reading materials that is highly sensitive to 
cultu ral context. While template -driven production approaches, crowdsourcing, open 
licences, and versioning may build a corpus quickly and at a low cost, they are all Western 
models of knowledge production and mobilization that require careful navigation when 
used for the generation of culturally sensitive literary materials for primarily oral contexts. 
Literary culture, children’s literature, and mass literacy has developed over hundreds of 
years in the global North; ultimately, we wonder, what is the effect of  accelerating the 
process in particular settings with newly literate populations? Evidently there is much work 
to be done in examining the limitations and affordances of various models for this proposed 
work.  
 
Conclusion 
Many have represented low literacy rates in majority world contexts as a crisis, and 
a range of literacy programs have been initiated in response—some of which we have 
discussed in this paper. We view these programs as exceedingly valuable in many ways. 
We also recognize, however, even as we acknowledge our involvement in such projects 
(two of the authors of this paper spearheaded the CODE Ethiopia project described earlier), 
that we must continue to engage in critical conversations about the impacts —both positive 
and negative —of various interventions. As Graff (1979) rightly observed almost four 
decades ago, it is not a given that literacy translates to economic, social, and cultural 
success. On the contrary, literacy is often used by those in authority as the “vehicle for the 
efficient training of the population and the maintenance of hegemony” (Graff, 1979, 236). 
As Luke (2008) has observed, “in contemporary human capital models of education,” 
advocated by institutions such as UNESCO, “levels of literacy c ontinue to be taken as 
robust predictors of economic ‘take -off,’ industrial development and, indeed, 
socioeconomic and political enfranchisement” (p. 247). Wickens and Sandlin (2007) 
suggest that in spite of the fact that the literacy community is fully aw are that literacy is 
inherently political—and that many current programs continue social control —there is a 
persistent suggestion that literacy education is vital in all parts of the globe, even in contexts 
with strong oral traditions. Thus, its absence is  met with panicked movements to address a 
perceived lack as quickly as possible.  
Ultimately, in reference to programs of potential relevance in the Ethiopian context, 
we ask the following questions: What are the implications of initiatives that impose 
Western models of literacy in contexts with strong oral traditions? What is the long -term 
effect of rapid injection of literary materials on emergent communities of literary artists 
and illustrators in local contexts? What are the limitations of current appro aches that lean 
toward template -driven, dual -platform publication and perhaps obscure the possibility of 
multimodal approaches? In contexts where the oral transmission of knowledge prevails, 
are there possibilities for more innovative, multimodal approache s that might harness the 
affordances of digital publication? None of these are easy questions, but they are vital as 
we consider conditions for inclusion and equity across multiple communities, languages, 
forums, and expressive modes within the Ethiopian c ontext and beyond.

Abstract— In recent years, developing countries have experienced 
fast growth in internet usage. As a result, there has been rapid 
development in the deployment of information and communication 
technologies in these countries. Information is often exchanged 
through t hese technologies by users. Over the years, this information 
has been under attack b y those with malicious intent. While there is 
growing awareness about these threats in the Western world, aware -
ness in developing countries is poor. Nigeria is a developing country 
in Africa that has  experienced rapid growth in internet and mobile 
technology usage with a reported mobile phone teledensity of 97.47% 
and nearly 186 million active mobile internet subscriptions {NCC, 
2019, Industry Statistics}. As these advancements are new, the 
citizens o f this country may not be aware of the  threats associated 
with them. This paper examines the level of cyber -security awareness 
amongst the general public using a quantitative online survey. A 
sample size of 176 Nigerians responded to the survey. The result s 
from the survey indicate that the knowledge of cybersecurity is 
moderate although, several cases of poor practices such as choice of 
weak passwords, free anti -virus software, and password sharing 
were observed. It was also found that despite the presence  of 
ngCERT, a body tasked with the responsibility of managing the risks 
of cyber threats in Nigeria and also the first point of contact for 
victims of cyber -crime, many of the respondents (77.84%) are not 
aware of this. Thus, there is an immediate need for  concerned 
agencies to create more awareness programs to enlighten citizens on 
the dangers of poor cyber -security practices . 
I. INTRODUCTION  
The world is in the so -called Info rmation Age, characterized 
by rapid deplo yment of information and communication 
technologies. Organisations in this age rely heavily on 
information technology tools to interact with their customers 
and deliver services. Similarly, individuals utilize these tools 
to communicate with each other as well as to access services 
from both gover nment and private organizations.  Most of 
these interactions are made through the World Wide Web, 
emails and mobile applications. Thus, the use of these 
technologies has risen exponentially in recent years (Alotaibi, 
et al. 2016) . According to the recent data from the 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU), there are 4.1 
billion internet users worldwide, this represe nts 53.6% of the 
global population  (ITU, 2019) . Internet usage in Africa has 
also increased over the years, with data from ITU showing an 
increase from 2.1 in 2005 to 24.4% of the co ntinent's 
population using the internet in 2018 (ITUnews, 2018) . 
Nigeria’s internet pen etration rate was 27.7% in 2017 (ITU, 
2019). These figures are expected to grow given the 
proliferation of mobile phones, the fast pace of internet 
penetration and technology d eployme nt in both developed and 
developing countries.  
Due to the rapid growth in communic ation technologies 
and the advantages they provide, organizations now rely heavily on them to improve the efficiency of their pr ocesses 
and to deliver effective services, thu s further integrating 
technology in our daily lives.  Daily activities such as 
shopping, banking, and entertainment are now carried out 
online using mobile devices. However, whilst these 
technologies provide easy access to information and a chance 
to condu ct such activities anytime and anywhere, they also 
provide an avenue for those with malicious intent to misuse or 
destroy such information (Alarifi, Tootell , & Hyland, 2012) . 
Over the last few years, crimes associated with these 
technologies have risen significantly. According to Symantec 
Corporation, 978 mi llion people in 20 countries were affected 
by cybercrime in 2017 alone (Symantec, 2017) . The cost of 
cybercrimes according to a 2018 study by McAfee and a think 
tank, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 
is esti mated at $600 billion, this figure is up from $500 billion 
the last time a similar study was conducted in 2014 (Lewis, 
2018) . 
Lewis believed the reasons for this growth are largely due 
to the adoption of new attack technologies, an increase in 
internet users from countries with weak cybersecurity and 
increased ease of committing cybercrime with the growth of 
Cybercrime -as-a-Service.  
Tackling cybercrimes is challenging for both developed 
and developing countries, this task is even mor e challenging 
for d eveloping countries largely due to their weak 
cybersecurity frameworks. A study by (Kshetri, 2010) , found 
that most organizations in developing economies adopt 
technologies without considering their security problems thu s 
subjecting their technological infrastructure to cyber -attacks. 
Also, many internet users in the developing world are 
inexperienced and not technically savvy. This is a big problem 
especially with the rate of growth of Smartphone usage in 
these countries  (Poushter, Bishop, & Chwe, 2018) . 
Nigeria, which is one of the fastest d eveloping countries in 
Sub-Saharan Africa, h as seen tremendous growth in internet 
usage and deployment of communication techno logies in 
recent years. According to the N igerian Communication 
Commission (NCC), the country's telecommunication 
regulatory agency, In January 2019, reported a mobile phone 
tele-density of 97.47% and nearly 186 million active mobile 
internet subscriptions. This shows that more than 90% of 
Nigeria's population which is currently around 195 million are 
connected to the internet. Online banking, electronic 
commerce and social me dia for communication are relatively 
new in Nigeria. The proliferation in the use of the internet in 
Nigeria began in 2008, when it was reported that for every 100 
persons, 15 are connected (Vanguard, 2010) . Therefore, it can 
be assumed that the importance of cybersecurity and the International Research Journal of Advanced Engineering and Science

security measures to be taken against cyber -attacks are limited 
within the general public.  
According t o the country’s National I nformation 
Technology Development Agency (NITDA), in 2018, 60% of 
Nigerian firms suffered cyber -attacks, 43% of which are small 
and medium enterprises which are the backbone of the 
country’s economy (Osuagwu, 2019) . Thus, it is very 
important to assess the level of cyber -security awar eness in the 
country. Besides, most studies on cybersecurity awareness in 
the literature are carried out in western countries. Nigeria as a 
devel oping country is different from these countries, the 
culture, diversity and the u nderstanding of cybersecurity 
differs. Thus, this paper seeks to feel this gap by focusing on 
the information security awareness of the people of Nigeria. 
To the best of the a uthors' knowledge, this study is the first to 
be carried out at this scale.  
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS  
Surveys were used as the research a pproach for 
investigating and understanding the level of cybersecurity 
awareness among the people of Nigeria. This approach  was 
adopted because we aim to gather data from a large sample of 
Nigerians. Thus, surveys in the form of questionnaires are the 
most suitable. Moreover, as the study seeks to get inputs from 
all over Nigeria, we decided that online surveys would be 
most a ppropriate. The language of the questionnaire was 
English and the questions were selected from questionnaires 
of similar studies in the lite rature notably, we selected 
questions from the studies by (Alarifi et al., 2012; Alotaibi et 
al., 2016) . The questionnaire comprises of 13 questions. The 
first part of the questionnaire contains questions that aim to 
obtain general informa tion such as users' demographics, level 
of education, internet skills, devices used to access the internet 
and purpose of internet usage. The second part of the 
questionnaire targets users' cybersecurity awar eness. We used 
eSurv, a popular free online surv ey tool recommended by 
(Farmer, Oakman, & Rice, 2016)  as the most appr opriate 
when collecting non -personally ide ntifiable data. We ensured 
a high response rate by distributin g the link to the 
questionnaire on social media platforms such as Facebook, 
Twitter, and WhatsApp. As a result, we were able to obtain 
176 responses. The period of the survey was between 
February and March 2019.  
III. RESULTS  
176 Nigerians took part in the study , there was no null 
response as all questions were answered by the participants. 
The questionnaire result which is in two parts; user 
demographic/general information and cybersecurity awareness 
is presented b elow.
 
User Demographic and General Info rmation  
152 (86.6%) were male and 24 (13.6%) were female.  This 
disproportionate female response confirmed findings in earlier 
studies particularly, the study by (Poushter, 2016)  were gender 
gaps on many aspects of tec hnology use, including the internet 
was o bserved in A frican nations. The percentage of the 
participants' age group to the nearest whole number (31%) were aged 18 -29, (65%) were aged 30 -39, (4%) were aged 40 -
49 and (1%) were aged 50 and over. Out of the 176 
participants, (2%) had secondary or primary educatio n and 
(98%) had tertiary education. With regards to the participants' 
internet access, (85%) said they had access to the internet 
throughout the day and (15%) said they access the internet 
only once or twice a day. In terms of internet skills, (3%) of 
the respondent had beginner skills, (51%) had intermediate 
and (46%) had expert skills. The popular devices used by 
respondents to access the internet are; pc/laptop (5%), 
smartphone (47%),  tablet (2%). A signif icant number of the 
respondents, (46%) said they used pc/laptops, smartphones, 
and ta blets to access the internet.  
Cyber Security Practices/Awareness  
In this section, we asked respondents about their 
cybersecurity practices. The first question asked if respondents 
physically s ecure their portable devices  (e.g. laptops, mobile 
phones, etc .), (67%) of respondents indicated that they kept 
their devices in a secure place, (28%) said they sometimes 
physically secure their devices while (5%) said they do not 
physically secure their d evices making them prone to theft or 
loss. Physically securing devices specifically those with 
sensitive data is an important practice in cybersecurity, as 
access to these devices by those with malicious intent can put 
organizations and individuals at risk.  
The second question asked respondents if they secure their 
devices using passwords. Securing computing devices using 
passwords is an important practice in cybersecurity. Users are 
encouraged to do this to prevent unauthorized access, which if 
occurred can lead to data and informati on loss and som etimes 
financial loss Users' identities can also be stolen and used in 
conducting criminal activities which may put them into legal 
trouble. Thus, protecting devices using a password is an 
important practice in cybe rsecurity. The results fro m our 
survey show that most of the respondents (94.3%) use 
passwords to log into their devices. These findings are 
presented in Table I.  
 
TABLE  I: Password use  
Do you secure your devices using login passwords? (N=176)  
 percentage  count  
Yes 94.3%  166 
No 5.7%  10 
 
Though, most of the respondents said they used a 
password to protect their devices however, the strength of the 
passwords determines the level of security they can pr ovide. 
Systems protected using weak pas swords are susceptible to 
break -in attack s. Therefore, we asked the respondents their 
password creation practice, we wanted to find if they create 
passwords using personal information such as names, date of 
birth, mobile phone number, etc. Table II below shows that 
more than half of the responden ts used personal information to 
create pas swords. We believe this is a poor security practice 
and is a well -known problem in the security domain that 
including personal i nformation in passwords aids attackers in 
passwords guessing or brute -force attack (Castelluccia, 
Chaabane, Dürmuth, & Perito, 2013) . It is believed that the International Research Journal of Advanced Engineering and Science

limitation of human memory is the reason why users tend to 
create passwords using personal info rmation. The idea is that 
such passwords can be easily remembered (Li, Wang, & Sun, 
2017). Nowadays, most personal information on users can be 
found online without much hassle, thanks to the exponential 
growth in social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter 
coupled with users’ open attitudes of sharing personal 
information online, pas sword cracking is now easier than ever.

Users can reduce their susceptibility to password guessing 
or brute -force attack by creating strong passwords. Experts 
believed strong passwo rds are those that are long, have at least 
15 characters, contain a mix of characters and letters (both 
upper - and lower -case) (Empey, 2018) . We asked the 
respondents how strong they believe their passwords were 
although we had to make sure the respondents know what is 
considered a strong password. Therefore, we i ncluded this 
explanation as part of the que stion, then we asked them to rate 
how strong they consider their passwords are based on the 
provided information. Figure 1, shows 58% of the respondents 
think their passwords were  very strong, 39% believed their 
passwords were strong and 3% believed they have very weak 
passwords.  
 
 
Figure 1: Respondents’ password strength  
 
Another important practice in cybersec urity is the regular 
change of passwords. Users are frequently advised to change 
their pas swords regularly as part of a precautionary measure to 
ensure access is ended in case of account hijack. We asked 
respondents how often they changed their passwords.  12% 
said regularly, 66% said sometimes and 22% said never. When 
asked whether they share their passwords with someone, 15 
respon dents skipped this question. We believe this may be 
attributed to the sensitive nature of the question. Nevertheless, 
Table III presents the responses of 161 respondents that 
attempted this question . 
The findings in Table III shows that 62% of the 
respondents do not share their pas swords, perhaps for security 
concerns. Ho wever, it also shows that 24% of respondents share passwords with their families, 9% with friends and 5% 
with system administrators . This raises the question of why 
people share passwords with family and friends as opp osed to 
system administrators. Our fin dings are similar to those of 
(Alarifi et al., 2012) , where it was found that a high level of 
Saudi's (130 out of 363) share their pas swords with family 
members. (Alarifi et al., 2012)  believed it is due to the cultur al 
beliefs in Saudi, where members of the family are considered 
more trustworthy than those who are not members of the 
family. We believed a similar case applies in the Nigerian 
context.

Being safe online nowadays requires knowledge of 
existing cyber threats and the protection mechanism available. 
Aside from virus es, which most of the respondents are aware 
of, there are other cybersecurity threats including phishing, 
denial of service, identity theft, etc ., that may lead to loss of 
data, co nfidentiality, and availability of services. We asked the 
respondents to ind icate if they are aware of some popular 
cyber threats. We also compare the results from this question 
with the results of similar research conducted on Saudi 
Arabians by (Alarifi et al., 2012) , Table IV presents our 
findings.  
 
TABLE  IV: Cybersecurity threats awareness  
Knowledge of existing cyber threats  
 Saudi Arabia  Nigeria  
Viruses  87.2%  92.1%  
Spam emails  57.8%  86.9%  
Phishing  29.7%  44% 
Denial of Service (DoS)  7.4%  36.9% 
Identity theft  25.5%  73.8%  
 
The findings in Table IV show that most of the 
respondents are aware of the listed threats. Specifically, 
Viruses, Spam emails, and identity theft are the most known 
threats by respondents. The results from the survey also show 
that respondents from Nigeria tend to have a better knowledge 
of these threats. However, due to the differences in sample 
size, a conclusion cannot be made.  We also found that 
Phishing, despite being a serious threat in cybersecurity is not 
widely kn own by respondents from both Nigeria and Saudi 
Arabia. Phishing which is the use of social engineering 
techniques and technical su bterfuge to lure users to fake 
websites where their sensitive information such as credit cards 
are harvested is a major proble m in cybersecurity today. 
According to a recent report by the Anti -Phishing Working 
Group (ATPWG), the total number of phishing sites detected 
rose to 266, 387 in the 3rd quarter of 2019 from 182, 465 in 
the 2nd quarter of the same year. This almost double s the 138, 
328 phishing sites detected in the 4th quarter of 2018 (APWG, 
2019) . The trend can be seen in Figure 2. The APWG also  International Research Journal of Advanced Engineering and Science

keeps a record of the number of unique phishing email s it 
receives from the general public and co nsumers, this emails 
also increases to 122,359 in the 3rd quarter of 2019, from 
112,163 in the 2nd quarter of the same year. Thus, there is a 
need for internet users in these countries to be enlightened 
more abou t these attacks and ways to ensure they do not fall 
victim to such attacks.

While being aware of the existence of security threats is 
good, however, awareness and protection are two different 
things. I nternet users are required to be both aware of the 
existing threats and to employ several defensive mechanisms 
to protect themselves. Thus, it is good to know what security 
mechanisms are used  by the respondents to safeguard 
themselves against cyber threats.  When asked this question, 
51% of the r espondents said they used Anti -virus software, 
11% said they used Anti -spam software, 9% said they used 
Anti-spyware and 29% said they used internet s ecurity 
software. The results show that most of the respondents rely 
on Anti -virus and internet security software for protection. 
From the authors' experience, one of the reasons people in 
Nigeria rely on Anti -virus and internet security software for 
prote ction is because they are free. To co nfirm this, our next 
question asked respon dents to select the category of software 
they used for protection. Majority of the r espondents (48%) 
said they used freeware -a software that is freely distributed to 
users at no  cost, (21%) said they used licensed pr otective 
software and (31%) indicated they used both free and licensed 
software as a protective mechanism. The fact that the m ajority 
of the respondents used Freeware is a big concern as software 
in this category tend  to offer only the basic protection. 
(Mediati, 2010)  compared free and paid anti -virus software in 
terms of their malware detection capability, and sp eed. 
Findings from the study found that paid antivirus products do 
slightly better than their free counterparts. Specifically, paid 
anti-virus was better at both detecting and removal of 
malware.  
Cyber -criminals nowadays are very a ctive and are 
frequently launching more s ophisticated malicious software. It 
is often a race, between those providing the defensive 
mechanisms and the cybercriminals. Thus, anti -virus software 
vendors provide frequent updates to users as a response to these i ncreasing number of th reats. Users, therefore, are 
required to update their protection sof tware regularly. In line 
with this, we asked respondents their software update practice, 
(46%) said they update their protection software regularly, 
(40%) said they do that every three mon ths or more and (14%) 
said they do not update their protective software.  
The internet today is full of threats, which can affect the 
integrity of data. Viruses and trojans do not just steal users' 
data but can also erase them. Users, therefore, are often 
advised to back -up their data regularly. There is also the 
increasing use and d eployment of ransomware; a software that 
encrypts user's data and demands a ransom before it is 
decrypted. Thus, backing up data is an essential practice in 
cyber -security. We se ek to find users' data back -up practice by 
asking them how often they back -up their data. (43%) said 
regularly, (49%) said sometimes and (8%) said never. This, 
therefore, implies that over 50% of our respon dents do not 
have a good back -up practice, making them susceptible to data 
loss. 
In an earlier question, we asked our r espondents if were 
aware of the existence of some cyber threats, we presented the 
result of this question in Table IV. Equally, we also wanted to 
know the percentage of respondents who ex perienced such 
threats. Therefore, we asked respondents if they have 
experienced any cybercrime in the last few years. Our findings 
show that (43%) of our respondents have experienced 
cybercrime, while (57%) indicated they have not exper ienced 
such attacks . This result is alarming and shows that cyber -
crimes are also prevalent in Nigeria.  In contrast to what is 
believed by many, that cybercriminals only target developed 
countries, our results show that even countries in the 
developing world are being targe ted by criminals. The 
prevalence of cyber -crime has resulted in many countries 
creating agencies and establishing dedicated lines for their 
citizens to contact in case they fall victim to such crimes. The 
idea is to provide enough information to the s ecurity agencies 
to aid in preventing future occurrences and to also lunch an 
investig ation. The Nigerian Government established the 
Nigeria Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT). The 
agency is tasked with the responsibility of managing the risks 
of cyber t hreats in Nigeria's cyberspace through the 
coordination of incidence response and mitigation strategies 
(ngCERT, 2020) . Unfortunately, Table V shows that 77.84% 
of the respondents were not aware of where and how to report 
security incidents. This low awareness would affect the rate at 
which cybersecurity incidences are dealt w ith, also, it would 
affect the overall function of ngCERT.

IV. CONCLUSIONS  
Over the last few years, there has been a signi ficant 
increase in internet usage and the deployment of information 
and communic ation technologies in Nigeria. While this has 
improved the overall digital outlook of the country, it has also 
increased the number of cyberattacks. The recent report by 
Nigeri a's information technology body NITDA, co nfirms this 
increasing trend. It shows that businesses specifically SMEs 
are facing i ncreasing cyber threats. We believe the lack of 
good cybersecurity practices amongst the country's general 
public as evidenced by our findings in this paper, is a 
contributing factor in the increased cybersecurity incidence in 
the country. Thus, there is a need for the country to strengthen 
its cybersecurity measures, including increasing awareness 
campaigns and programs.

Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse among Primary School Children in Langata Sub-county, Nairobi City County in Kenya   Wilkins Ndege Muhingi Pan Africa Christian University  Johnson Nzau Mavole St. Augustine University of Tanzania  Mumo Nzau University of Nairobi      Abstract Kenya introduced Digischool to public primary schools to prepare children for today¶s digital world attracting a cyber-threat landscape. Utilising a descriptive cross-sectional design within a concurrent mixed approach, the study examined the relationship between digital literacy intervention and online child abuse among primary school children in Langata sub-county. Targeted, were children between 9 and 17 years from private and public primary schools, teachers, parents and policy makers, and child protection officers. Godden¶s formula informed purposive and random sampling of 384 respondents, plus a 10% (423) respondents for Key Informant interviews and focused discussions. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics and content analysis with the help of SPSS version 22 and Nvivo version 12 respectively. The study revealed stakeholders intervened in online child abuse at various levels using several strategies.  The study revealed a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure online. Since the p-value (0.000) was less than alpha (0.05) and we conclude there was a significant relationship between the type of school and exposure to online child abuse.  There is a need for systems thinking and a concerted multi-sectoral approach to the improvement of digital literacy hence protecting children online.

 3 s well as a vital cornerstone of general education, digital literacy is one of the guiding forces in the growth of the digital age. In order to encourage Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG)-Quality Education, developing countries have integrated digital literacy into general education, making it an active part of the digital economy for the majority of their people (Urbancikova, Manakova & Ganna, 2017).  There are two common terms ³Digital divide´ and ³digital inclusion´, which relate to connectivity and internet utilization that have gained popularity (Nemer, 2015). The real origin of the term ³Digital divide´ is not known but it was advanced and began to be widely used in the mid-1990s to describe the disparity between households that have access to the Internet and households that do not have access to the Internet (Light, 2001; Pigato, 2001). However, this divide continues to persist today in the wake of COVID-19 (Aissaoui, 2021). Catalysts for bridging the digital divide on what former US Vice President Gore called ³the information superhighway´ was the notion of ICTs as global education and economic equalizer (Cerf, 2019). Computers were introduced in college classrooms around the world, and are making their way into primary and secondary schools in wealthy cities including developing countries (Tatnall, 1992; Tatnall & Davey, 2004). Access to the Internet is seen as a way to change education in profound ways.  Another term ³digital inclusion later took a centre stage among media and researchers. This term described the differences that existed between hardware and broadband access, in particular, this was about access to ICT knowledge in the home, the school, and the workplace. These disparities in digital access that remained among poor, undereducated, and racial-ethnic minorities and may affect the quality of life although (Ali, Alam, Taylor & Rafiq, 2020) observe studies have shown mixed results (Helsper, 2008; Livingstone & Helsper, 2007). The solution to inclusion is often described as community building, therefore grassroots organizations and community centers began offering access to ICTs through their facilities.  Digital inclusion presupposes that people who are not connected to ICTs want to join the digital society and need assistance in understanding the importance of the technology. Rather than trying to find who was not connected, the notion put forward in digital inclusion was to work toward bringing underserved populations²people in underdeveloped and developing nations; poor, undereducated people and racial-ethnic minorities in the United A  Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 4 States; and minority populations around the world²into the already existing digital society. The word ³inclusion´ is perceived as being more forward-thinking than the term ³divide´ when it comes to describing the state of digital affairs. Despite the shift in terminology and focus, several scholars and organizations around the world remain committed to the concept of the digital divide. In doing so, they have discovered more nuanced approaches to understanding the digital divide. The second wave of digital divide interrogates access as both physical and intellectual, and usage as place and purpose was introduced by Hargittai (2001) by investigating user differences in ICT skills.  According to Bean and Kern (2018), digital literacy is seen in the light of praxeology as school teachers carry out educational practices aimed at reducing risk behaviors facilitated by digital media and most frequently associated with: student cyberbullying (PyĪalski, 2012). The digital environment has been blamed for underutilised opportunities for learning, creativity, and social connectivity (Lomax, Murray & Pyer, 2018). According to the House of Lords (2017 as cited in Lomax, Murray and Pyer 2018), no child should leave school without a well-rounded understanding of the digital world. Digital literacy concepts have slight differences in reach or focus areas, and their meanings often overlap (Zhang & Zhu, 2016). Digital literacy is described as ³intelligence assembly´ by Paul Gilster (1997 as cited in Pool, 1997, p.9) and includes ³how to assimilate the information, analyze it, and reintegrate it.´ Digital literacy refers to the ability of individuals to use skills, knowledge, and understanding to make full use of the opportunities offered by the new media world as well as safeguard themselves from associated risks (Martin, 2005 as cited in Buckingham, 2007):   ³Digital literac\ is the aZareness, attitude and abilit\ of individuals to appropriately use digital tools and facilities to identify, access, manage, integrate, evaluate, analyse and synthesize digital resources, construct new knowledge, create media expressions, and communicate with others, in the context of specific life situations, to enable constructive social action; and to reflect upon this process´ (Martin, 2005, p. 135 as cited in Buckingham, 2007).  International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 5 Digital literacy can be seen as an umbrella concept that includes elements of other literature that share conceptual grounds with other forms of literacy, such as knowledge literacy that is capable of identifying, finding, assessing and using information (UNESCO, 2018; Cummins, Becker & Alexander, 2016), media literacy that is, the ability to access, recognize and critically evaluate media messages (Koltay, 2011) and news media literacy. i.e., the ability to apply core media literacy skills to news (Vraga, Tully, Kotcher, Smithson & Broeckelman-post, 2015; Maksl, Craft, Ashley & Miller, 2017). Digital literacy skills include but are not limited to Instrumental (or essential or functional), insightful (comprehension, navigation, assessment), and social (communication, disclosure, privacy) (Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). There worldwide recognition of the importance for children to be digitally literate (CoE, 2018; Keeley & Little, 2017), although there are limited studies on relationship between digital literacy and online safety (Nascimbeni & Vosloo, 2019).  According to Sonck and de Haan (2014), there are very few longitudinal studies looking at the relationship between digital skills and threats online. Kids, like teenagers, are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills (Rodríguez de Dios, 2018; Sonck & de Haan, 2014; Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). Besides, research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital capabilities will gain more from online opportunities (Lee & Chae, 2012; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Nikken & Schols, 2015; Sonck & de Haan, 2013). Certain empirical studies, on the contrary, have shown that the more qualified teenagers there are, the more risks they face online (Lee & Chae, 2012; Leung & Lee, 2012; Livingstone, Ólafsson, Helsper, Lupiáñez-Villanueva, Veltri & Folkvord, 2017; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Sonck & de Haan, 2013; Staksrud et al., 2013).  According to Joyce, Pham, Stanton Fraser, Payne, Crellin & McDougall (2014), the history of digital literacy and online education projects has been patchy for example in the UK despite recent calls for a clear curriculum for digital media education since media education aims to teach students how to become critical media users through media analysis and media production (Children's Commissioner, 2017; Hobbs as cited in Polizzi, 2020). Previous research according to Marsh, Hannon, Lewis, & Ritchie (2017) and Plowman et al. (2012) showed the early establishment of 'digital literacy' in young children (0-8) and learning through home technology. Citing Görzig, and Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 6 Ólafsson (2011), Livingstone, Davidson, Bryce, Batool, Haughton, and Nandi (2017) observed that girls tended to report slightly fewer digital skills than boys and younger children reported considerably fewer skills than older teenagers. Moreover, skills of children with disabilities, who are discriminated against, or who are from disadvantaged backgrounds, vary ± some have fewer skills commensurate with their fewer resources or available supports, but others have developed skills partly through facing negative experiences online (Livingstone et al., 2017).  Children¶s digital literacy changed qualitatively with age for example, at around 9 to 10 years, children were concerned with what was real or not, although they would not discriminate real from fake. At 11 to 13 years children were more concerned with what was fun or even transgressive, irrespective of whether it was trustworthy. Lastly, by 14 to 16 years their increasing maturity led teenagers to refocus on what was more valuable for them or more generally (Livingstone, 2014; Livingstone, Kirwil, Ponte & Staksrud, 2014). The shift in focus would be brought about by a change in peer and parental relations with the children and had implications for the incidence of online risks encountered by children (Ofcom, 2016). Children¶s digital literacy was found to increase fairly steadily from age 8 to young adulthood. Also, with increasing age, children gained digital literacy to realise that some but not all search engine results could be trusted (Ofcom, 2016).  A study comparing EU Kids Online and Net Children Go Mobile also showed little change in the levels of children¶s digital literacy and safety skills since 2010, although children are now better able to manage their privacy settings and to delete their browsing history. On the other hand, the same comparison showed that the proportion of children whose profiles were public had nearly doubled from 11 to 19% of social network users aged between 9 to 16, which may reflect the diversification in social networks used (Livingstone et al., 2014). Schools are an important partner in ensuring child protection online (Shipton, 2011). E-safety guidance from schools is particularly helpful for children from under-resourced households where parents lack confidence or expertise concerning digital media (Livingstone, Mascheroni, Dreier, Chaudron & Lagae, 2015). Whittle, Hamilton-Giachritsis, and Beech (2014) found that support from schools along with support from parents and friends also assisted with the recovery of victims of online grooming and sexual abuse. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 7 According to Ofcom (2016), e-safety strategies and initiatives schools would use in protecting children online include annual talks, some with members of the police and/or NSPCC representatives, information videos and associated lesson plans: ³We saw a video on CBBC about a girl and Direction and she gave out her details and didn¶t realize.´ (Girl, 8-9 years old, Nottingham), e-safety pupil representatives: ³I am an e-Safety rep at school and we help to tell [others] how to be safe online.´ (Girl, 8-9 years old, Nottingham), take-home µcontracts¶ to share with parents to agree to terms of safe internet use and a Safer Internet Day, held once a year, and other campaigns. In studying two primary schools, Shipton (2011) found that the schools preferred developing the critical capabilities of the students rather than employing blanket filters. This was done to ensure that children can manage risks both at school and elsewhere. Aston and Brzyska (2012) further strengthen the argument for developing critical capacities among children by observing that majority of teachers felt that their pupils had the skills and knowledge to use the internet safely in school yet only 58% felt that the children were similarly equipped to use it safely at home. Other scholars, Byrne et al. (2016) revealed that high percentages of children had basic digital literacy skills but only about 20% (on average) used the internet for creative activities (creating blogs, videos, and websites). Studies show that the more digitally literate children become, the more they can gain from the internet while avoiding or coping with online risks (Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). According to Rouchun, Zongkui, Shuailei, Qingqi and Chen (2019, citing Bronfenbrenner, 1989), the family atmosphere is the most critical micro-system that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socio-economic status as a distal environment. Access to, familiarity with, and skill using mobile devices are a first step in achieving digital literacy. A study showed that most children started using mobile devices in their first year of life, and use was enabled by parents who gave children a device to use and to keep. Three out of four parents gave children a mobile device when doing chores and to keep them calm (Kabali, Irigoyen, Nunez-Davis, Budacki, Mohanty, Leister & Bonner, 2015). µDigital literacy¶ or µe-skills¶ is crucial to children¶s use of the internet. Internet literacy is a capability constitutive to utilizing the advantages of the Internet and as Knobel and Lankshear (2006) assert has a close relationship with participation in cyber-culture. Byrne et al. (2016) observe that the Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 8 creation of online content by children is a means of self-expression as well as an important vehicle for participation in matters that affect them, participation being one of the underlying principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. A broad concept of Internet literacy refers to the information, skills, and behaviors used in a wide range of digital devices such as smartphones, laptops, PCs, etc. (Taylor & Dalal, 2014 citing Julian, 2013). Cyber-safety risks for children when using video sharing platforms, websites, social networking sites, and games include but are not limited to: Exposure to pornography; Violent content; Contact and conduct risks; Cyberbullying and associated low self-esteem and emotional responses; Contact with strangers and online predation; Content and practices that are not age appropriate through viewing media used by older siblings; Identity theft; and Malware (Robinson, 2013 citing Green et al., 2011). The children¶s limited digital literacy skills increase the potential for harm to them. One report noted children of [primary school] age are particularly challenged in their cognitive and emotional abilities to cope with online risk. It follows then, that these risks increase where adult supervision is inadequate (Baldry, Sorrentino & Farrington, 2019). A study by Tomczyk (2019) in the field of digital security in the school and family environment in Poland revealed that digital literacy was necessary, especially in a group of people who are responsible for facilitating digital safety. A good example is parents who are in contact with children all the time and most time give digital devices to children under their care with good reasons or to keep them off so that they can concentrate on their work.   Parents have to ensure an appropriate degree of digital protection at home since previous study revealed a positive relation between socio-economic status and digital literacy Tran et al. (2020). However, a study by Moawad and Ebrahem (2016) reported a negative correlation between adolescents¶ technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology, the more their social interaction with their parents was affected.  On the other hand, teachers help their students improve their digital literacy (Savage, 2015). Because of the nature of their work, teachers also have a responsibility to create approaches that promote effective media exposure and socialisation. This is only feasible if teachers have sufficient and up-to-date information about the risks emerging from digital media prevalence. Teachers International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 9 particularly teaching in primary school bear particular responsibility for ensuring digital safety (Cortina-Pérez, Gallardo-Vigil, Jiménez-Jiménez & Trujillo-Torres, 2014). At the educational point, teachers can influence the behaviors of students that would allow them to protect themselves from traditional and non-standard e-threats such as problem Internet usage, cyberbullying, image security, recognition of false information, sexting, copyright infringements, hygiene of digital media navigation, sensitivity to Internet challenges Digital literacy is undergoing constant changes as the information system is undergoing simultaneous transformations. Digital literacy requires not just the technological capacity to use digital media, but also the mechanisms linked to risky behavior awareness. A study in the UK showed that one would be termed as internet literate when they can: find information confidently, they can send an instant message, fix a problem on their computer or set up an email account or even download music. Internet literate children may also be able to filter or remove a virus from their computer among other activities. Boys were found to be more skilled than girls. For example, when a girl was able to send an instant message, a boy would be able to download music. The study also revealed that internet skills increased with age (Livingstone, Bober, & Helsper, 2005). Kenya, with a population of over 48.5 million people (as of 2016), is generally regarded as one of Africa's most technologically advanced nations. According to estimates, about 85 percent of the population is covered by third generation (3 G) technology in2017, but only 17.8% of individuals and 33.7 percent of households have internet access. In addition, Kenya's telecommunications revenues increased from USD 1.32 billion in 2014 to USD 1.65 billion in 2016 (Okyere, 2020 citing ITU, 2018).  Materials and Methods  The study was carried out in Nairobi City County specifically Langata Sub-county. Langata Sub-county is one of the nine sub-counties in Nairobi City County which is one of the 47 counties in the Republic of Kenya. The Sub-County lies in the South West of Nairobi, bordering Kajiado County to the North. This sub-county has four divisions and eight wards namely: Karen, Hardy, Lenana, Nairobi West, Olympic, Mugumuini, Bomas, and South C (County, 2018). This study site was selected because of its accessibility to Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 10 cyber cafes and high-speed Internet and the availability of many schools that had very well equipped computer labs and ICT Innovation Centres and good internet connection. It was also preferred because it housed the various levels of population in terms of socio-economic status comprising of the high class, the middle class, and the low class which is not characteristic of the other sub-counties within Nairobi City County. This sub-county also had several Information technology innovation centres. The researchers utilized a descriptive cross-sectional design within a concurrent mixed approach collecting and analysing both qualitative and quantitative data at the same time (McCusker & Gunaydin, 2015). The study targeted children between ages 9 years and 17 years old from selected private and public primary schools in Langata Sub-county, teachers, parents and policy makers within the Department of children services and Directorate of Criminal Investigation. Godden¶s formula informed the sample size determination of 384 respondents, plus 10% of the sample size to cater for non-response by respondents making a total of 423 respondents. Key Informant interviews were also carried out targeting 9 parents, 9 Key informant teacher respondents, 2 Key informant Child protection officer respondents all sampled purposively.  The researchers utilised simple random, stratified purposive sampling, stratified sampling, convenience, and purposive sampling designs. Three schools were selected from three regions within Langata Sub-county which included: Karen, South C, and Mugumuini wards. The study sought both empirical data and secondary data from published sources like general and specific search engines. Interviews and focused group discussions were carried (5 FGDs) which enabled the collection of data using interview guides, questionnaires, and FGD guides tools. Quantitative data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics with the help of SPSS version 22. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were applied to examine relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Data were transformed to enable further inferential statistics to relate variables and help test hypotheses. Findings were presented using graphs, frequencies, charts, and tables. Qualitative data were analysed using content analysis with the help of Nvivo version 12 and presented in narrative and map forms. Informed written consent was sought in writing and verbally from all respondents including teachers, parents, children and protection officers following the right International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 11 procedure, who were prepared in advance on the nature of questioning including the degree of sensitivity of the subject. Parents and guardians were approached to give consent on behalf of their children. All participants were allowed to take part in the study. However, they were informed that if they wished to withdraw from the study at some point then they were allowed.  Ultimate confidentiality was observed in regards to the individuals sampled for purposes of data collection, especially regarding the case studies. No information provided by the children, teachers, parents, child protection officers, and government officials was shared with any other person for any purpose other than supervisors and where was required so to prepare this research report. Lastly, the researcher disseminated research findings as planned.  Results and Discussion  This section presents characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents. Besides, the researchers present the type of schools respondents attended, the risky actions by respondents when they go online and the categories of cyberbullying and abuse experienced while online. Finally presented was digital literacy that was measured using twenty-five items among the respondents.  Table 1.  Distribution by response rate  Frequency  Percentage  Complete questionnaires  370 87% Not Completed questionnaires  53 13% Total  423 100% Source (Field data, 2019)  The researchers purposively selected 12 primary schools, two private schools and two public schools per ward in the selected three wards out of the eight that existed from within Langata Sub-county in Nairobi. The total sample was 423 pupils, out of which 370 successfully filled and returned questionnaires. The researchers invited children respondents aged 9 years to 17 years enrolled in primary public and private schools in Langata Sub-County in Nairobi City County in Kenya to participate in the study. Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 12 Questionnaires were administered to the children and out of the 423 questionnaires, 53 (13%) of the children either refused to or did not return their questionnaires. A good number 370 (87%) filled the questionnaires successfully and returned. The questionnaires that were filled successfully were sufficient for analysis for a response rate. That shows that automatically the study sample remained 370 respondents.   Demographic Profile of Respondents   This section presents the characteristics of the demographic profile of the respondents. The characteristics of the children were, age, gender, class, type of school, residence and level of education of parents. Of the 370 respondents, 49.2 % were girls while 188 (50.2%) were boys. The findings revealed that the highest number of those who successfully filled and returned questionnaires were class six pupils forming a 22.2% (82) as shown in table 3. The study found that 91 (24.6%) were 12 years old followed by 78 (21.1%) 61 (16.5%) were 13 years old as the least number. This may be attributed to the fact that most pupils after age 13 may have transited to secondary school. The highest number of respondents 38.4% (142) resided in the Mugumuini area followed by the Karen area 37.3% (138) and only 24.3% (90) resided in South C because the response rate was low in South C ward. The study showed that 175 (47.3%) pupils in public schools accessed the internet while 191 (51.6%) in private schools accessed the internet. This revealed that a higher number of children in private schools access the internet compared to those in public schools. This was because in private schools children used the internet even for their homework assignments. A very small but equal number of 2(0.5%) respondents did not access the internet. Children from private schools were from higher social economic status and therefore their parents afford internet and internet access gadgets. According to Rouchun, Zongkui, Shuailei, Qingqi and Chen (2019 citing Bronfenbrenner, 1989), the family atmosphere is the most critical micro-system that exerts the most significant impact on young children for example socio-economic status as a distal environment. Earlier survey results showed that families with elevated socio-economic status had more Internet access devices and more Internet access resources for children (Lenhart et al., 2001). The findings concur with a related study by Tran et al. (2020) revealing a positive International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)

The online action considered less risky was gaming at 5.7% (21). This means that the children had experienced abuse through some videos. They reported having watched music video clips they considered offensive. Almost half the respondents 48.6% (180) had experienced bullying that involved strangers sharing pictures and videos with them. Some children 27 % reported having experienced abuse through text messages through phones. Whatsapp and e-mail recorded the lowest 5.4% (20) considering it not easily used for cyberbullying. Only 5.4 % had experienced abuse through the e-mail. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 15 Most of the children did not either know how to use mails or use mails often, the reason for a low percentage. Few 5.4 % had experienced abuse through WhatsApp since it was a smartphone application and few of them had their phones. Those who had experienced abuse through WhatsApp agreed to have shared with siblings or those who owned phones. Others cited Facebook as a site where they experienced abuse.  Table 5.

The children were at risks of exposure online for example:  ³When children access the internet the\ pla\ games like ³Blue Whales´ Zhich ma\ be disastrous. A good e[ample is Zhen children end up committing suicide.´ When children accept friend requests on social media and other platforms that exist it is risky because some are abducted mostly because they are interacting with people who enjoy anonymity. It is scary that some pose as children and children easily trust and start engaging them. These online strangers ask children for information and family details Zhich makes the children more vulnerable to trafficking.´ (Respondent 3, 7th, March, 2019)  Digital literacy was measured using twenty-five items among the respondents and the results revealed the following: Findings on whether they frequently used the internet for schoolwork, 165 (44.6) strongly disagreed while 12 (3.2%) disagreed showing that more than half did not frequently use Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 16 the internet at school. Respondents reported they played internet games on their own with 65 (17.6%) agreeing and 141 (38.1%) strongly agreeing. About 30% did not watch video clips on the internet as 80 (21.6%) strongly disagreed and 68 (18.4%) disagrees. On whether they read/watched the news on the internet, 38 (10.3%) agreed while 102 (27.6%) strongly agreed.  Respondents agreed that they downloaded music or films as 55 (14.9%) agreed while 109 (29.5) strongly agreed.   Table 6.

The study revealed that of those who participated in, children did not play games online much with less than half, 148 (40.0%)  strongly disagreeing and 29 (7.8%) disagreeing. On whether they played games with other people online 99 (26.8) strongly disagree and 39 (10.5%) disagree.  On the use of a webcam 123 (33.2%) strongly disagreed and 29 (7.8%) disagreed.

Half of the respondents disagreed with spending time in a virtual world as 138 (37.3%) strongly disagreed and 74 (20.0%) disagreed. Children did not have the skill of writing blogs or online diaries and also bookmarking a website as 147 (39.7%) strongly disagreed and 45 (12.2%) disagreed and 92 (24.9%) strongly disagree and 62 (16.8%) disagree respectively.  Children were not able to block messages from someone they did not want to hear from, 105 (28.4%) strongly disagreed, and 35 (9.5%) disagreed. Quite a good number 143 (38.6%) were undecided for they were neutral.  They also reported they were neither able to change privacy settings on a social networking profile, 123 (33.2%) strongly disagreed while 32 (8.6%) disagreed nor delete the record of which sites they had visited, 83 (22.4%) strongly disagreed, and 87 (23.5%) disagreed.  The findings showed that respondents could not block unwanted adverts or junk mail/spam, 133 (35.9%) strongly disagreed, and 28 (7.6%) disagreed. Children disagreed with being able to change filter preferences, 117 (31.6%) strongly disagreed, and 33 (8.9%) disagreed. Again they were not able to find information on how to use the internet safely, 100 (27.0%) strongly disagreed, and 27 (7.3%) disagreed. Finally, respondents were unable to compare different websites to decide if the information was true, 139 (37.6%) strongly disagreed, and 25 (6.8%) disagreed. Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 18 The findings revealed that children were limited in skills concerning digital literacy and were therefore highly internet illiterate and this would either expose them to online abuse or even would shield them from predators since they were not so much exposed to internet risk. In comparison to what was indicated by prior literature, kids, like teenagers, are believed to be able to avoid negative consequences of digital technology by learning digital skills (Rodríguez de Dios, 2018; Sonck & de Haan, 2014; Sonck, Livingstone, Kuiper & de Haan, 2011). Besides, research indicates that those with more internet experience or digital capabilities will gain more from online opportunities (Lee & Chae, 2012; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Nikken & Schols, 2015; Sonck & de Haan, 2013). Certain empirical studies, on the contrary, have shown that the more qualified teenagers there are, the more risks they face online (Lee & Chae, 2012; Leung & Lee, 2012; Livingstone et al., 2017; Livingstone & Helsper, 2010; Sonck & de Haan, 2013).  Online coping is one-way children can deal with online child abuse-related encounters. It can be defined as µinternet-specific problem-solving strategies children adopt after a negative experience online¶ (Vandoninck et al., 2013, p. 61). A study by the EU Kids Online identified three main coping strategies: passive responses, that include fatalistic (stop using the internet for while) and self-accusatory responses (feeling guilty about what happened); proactive responses (such as reporting inappropriate content and contact, blocking the unwanted contact, etc.); and communicative responses (talking with parents, peers, teachers or other trusted adults about what happened) (Livingstone, Haddon, Görzig, & Ólafsson, 2011). Learning how to cope with negative experiences effectively is one of the most effective responses for any particular situation which is part of the process of building resilience among internet users (Vandoninck et al., 2013). Responding to online risks by seeking support from social networks is the most common coping strategy adopted by children, although in most cases they tend to combine two strategies (Livingstone et al., 2011).    Pearson Correlation   Correlations estimate the strength of the linear relationship between two (and only two) variables. Correlation coefficients range from -1.0 (a perfect negative correlation) to positive 1.0 (a perfect positive correlation). The closer International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 19 correlation coefficients get to -1.0 or 1.0, the stronger the correlation. The closer a correlation coefficient gets to zero, the weaker the correlation is between the two variables. Ordinal or ratio data (or a combination) must be used. After testing the hypothesis stated below, the researcher obtained the following results as interpreted them as shown:  H0 There is no relationship between exposure to the internet and digital literacy  The correlation coefficient for exposure to the internet and digital online literacy was 0.041. The number of respondents in the sample answering both items is 370 and 376 respectively. The p-value for this correlation coefficient was .431. There is a weak positive relationship between exposure to the internet and children internet digital literacy.  Table 7.

Correlation  .041 1 Sig.

The researcher used two-tailed because the direction was not known earlier. As shown in the table, a p-value of .431 indicates that the correlation is not significant and the two variables exposure and digital literacy are not linearly related. This implied that even if the children are exposed to the internet that alone does not improve much of their digital or internet literacy hence there is a need for them to be guided and assisted to navigate while using the internet for their security. It can further be interpreted that children exposed to the Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 20 internet would fall prey to predators and abusers whose tricks are dynamic and they are always ahead of the children. This is in agreement with Krueger (2002) who discovered Internet skills (the ability to access the web) was the most significant indicator of online participation) and deal with emails. People who are more familiar with the Internet and have good social skills and communication skills would benefit more from internet use, consistent with the Rich-Get-Richer-Theory (Kraut et al., 2002).

Other respondents, 64 (17.3 %) said it was a bit true,¶ 33 (8.9 %) agreed it was true their parents were more knowledgeable than them on matters internet and 15 (4.1 %) gave other reasons. This concurs with a study by Livingstone et al. (2015) on how parents of young children manage digital devices at home. Children don¶t believe that they have more internet abilities than their parents (Livingstone et al., 2015). This meant children had confidence in their parents guiding them on how to use the internet and keep safe. However, this is contrary to a study by Moawad and Ebrahem (2016) that reported a negative correlation between adolescents¶ technology usage and social interaction with their parents pointing out that the more adolescents used technology, the more their social interaction with their parents was affected. This raises the question of interaction and guidance provided by parents as indicated in this study although this study sample included younger children who may be more trusting to their parents compared to adolescents who listen to their peers more.

Respondents thought that they knew a lot of things about the internet meaning they were confident in their teachers guiding and protecting them while using the internet. A further 32.4% (120) respondents felt that it was not true that they know more about the internet while a small percentage 8.1% (30) thought it was not true they knew a lot about the internet. The reason being that they were either not accessing the internet, they were not digitally literate or they were not confident enough.  Conclusion  Access to cyber-space is no longer a luxury, but an everyday activity for many teachers and learners in the school environment, at home and other environments like cyber. This study found there was early access, early exposure, and early adoption of mobile media devices among young children in an urban, low-income, moderate, and high-income community. Online child abuse is today recognised as a global phenomenon since the internet has been found to have a powerful impact on the lives of children throughout the world. This would continue to grow and evolve. While Internet access and child usage were highest in industrialized countries, the global pace of web access and broadband penetration, and the exponential uptake of mobile phone technologies, coupled with increasing capacities and decreasing costs, means that the rest of the world is beginning to catch up in the next few years, Muhingi, Mavole & Nzau ± Digital Literacy and Online Child Abuse  
 22 it is anticipated that the most dramatic changes will occur in low- and middle-income countries. Based on the findings of this study the researchers concluded that the responsibility of online child protection was for every stakeholder including the state, parents, teachers, citizens, netizens, and children themselves. It was also concluded that training and the creation of awareness were important elements to consider in protecting children online. The study revealed low skills among parents and teachers on internet matters yet children looked up to them and believed they would guide them in remaining safe online. Children were found to be digitally literate. Digital literacy helped children to remain safe as well as exposing them to internet-related risks as was revealed by other studies.  Only a small proportion of contemporary adults had access to ICT when they were children, particularly the tools that have facilitated the revolution in interaction and communication This has probably affected the ability of adults to understand and empathize with the ways children and young people use the Internet, mobile phones and other new technologies. This may be especially true in societies where children¶s social activity, particularly that of adolescents, has been under fairly direct parental observation or control.  Recommendations  The government needs to develop strategies through the Ministry of Education to create institutional capacity to respond to online child abuse to educate minors in the responsible use of ICT. Moreover, programs for the prevention of cyberbullying should also integrate issues related to education about sexting and sexual solicitation among other harmful online child abuse issues. Holistic intervention concerning the different risks found on the Internet is also necessary following the fast and dynamic nature of the growth, accessibility, and availability of the internet which people are exposed to as early as 4 months. Moreover, sexual education programs in schools should address sexting, as it seems to be a new avenue through which adolescents express their sexuality. Besides, educators particularly teachers and parents should be informed about Internet risks and how to protect their children to educate their children on the responsible use of ICT with emphasis on digital skills. International and Multidisciplinary Journal of Social Sciences, 10(2)   
 23 The onus is on governments and the private sector to ensure that protection is integrated into promoting the expansion of access and the positive benefits the Internet brings. Cyber security awareness and training ought to be a top priority for all African states. This should be cross-cutting from the vulnerable sector or people in the society, school-going children, families, industry captains, critical national infrastructure handlers, government officials, and the entire African continent with its unique needs. The government of Kenya through the Communications Authority to first track: Establishing a database on reported cybercrime cases affecting children; Commissioning of national research on Online Child Sexual Exploitation, which once completed would provide a more reliable and full picture of OCSE in Kenya; Developing a training curriculum that could be used to train stakeholders on online safety of children and related risks and Developing a National Child Online Framework Strategy. The government needs to put in place the policy, legal and regulatory framework which is also important. That would require the involvement and support of the political leadership and goodwill at the very highest level. The lawmakers must be well trained and sensitised to help implement legislation that addresses cyber threats at all levels. There is a need to address online child abuse at the continental level. African countries need strong Information and Computer Technology institutions. This may be utilised to train cyber security experts in system administration, security audit, forensic investigation, information security, and software development to deal with the future challenges of cybercrime.

KEY MESSAGES 
• In Tanzania and Indonesia, we promoted the expansion of 
mobile savings accounts among women microentrepreneurs 
and provided them with business related training.  In 
doing so, we simultaneously relaxed supply- and demand-
side constraints to savings that women might face. 
• In both countries, the training enhanced the impact of promoting 
mobile savings. In Indonesia it led women to save more overall, 
including a nascent use of mobile accounts, and report greater 
decision making power within the household. In Tanzania, it led to 
substantially higher mobile savings, new businesses and products, 
more capital investment, labor effort, and better business practices.
• However, these short-term impacts have yet to translate 
into higher business profits. In Indonesia, we observe increased 
household welfare, but no discernible effects on business outcomes 
shortly after the training ended. In Tanzania, the increased business 
investments were not accompanied by greater profitability.
Savings can help businesses expand, by enabling them to finance lumpy investments 
and absorb unexpected shocks. However, several barriers stand in the way of 
women firm owners in developing countries who want to increase their savings. ARE MOBILE SAVINGS THE

Policy Brief Issue 29
Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure Authorized Public Disclosure AuthorizedFor instance: social pressures women might face 
to share their incomes with friends and family 
members, the high transaction costs of traditional 
savings products, and implicit or explicit biases from 
financial service providers against women as potential 
good customers. If despite these barriers women 
manage to set aside some savings, any effective 
use of these funds towards business expansion 
may take time to materialize, compete with other, 
more urgent uses, or be hindered by human capital 
limitations such as limited entrepreneurial ability. 
HERE’S WHAT WE DID
We designed two randomized control trials: 
one in Tanzania, the other in Indonesia. In both 
countries, we tested the impact of two interventions, 
separately and together, in alleviating some of 
the constraints impeding savings and business 
growth among women microentrepreneurs. The 
first intervention (“mobile savings” intervention) 
expanded access to mobile savings bank accounts. 
The second intervention (“business training” 
intervention) provided training to improve business 
skills and financial literacy. The specifics of each 
intervention differ by country, as follows.
Tanzania
In Tanzania, the mobile savings  intervention promoted 
M-Pawa: a mobile banking product linked to M-Pesa 
that allows customers to save money on an interest-
bearing mobile savings account. It also gives customers 
access to uncollateralized instant microloans. The 
intervention invited women microentrepreneurs for a 
training session on M-Pawa. At the end of the session, 
we helped women create an account with M-Pawa. We 
also offered them the option to set personal savings 
goals and receive weekly SMS savings reminders. 
This latter feature attempted to relax possible 
psychological barriers related to limited attention 
that could lead to under-adoption of the product.
The business training , designed and implemented 
by TechnoServe, lasted for 12 weekly group sessions. 
The training was designed by TechnoServe and it 
was explicitly adapted to women business owners. The goal was to teach and motivate women to set 
business goals, identify business opportunities, put 
ideas into practice, and mobilize finance (with a 
focus on savings). The curriculum also emphasized 
the importance of fostering personal effectiveness 
and perseverance, as well as the benefits of a 
more gender equal society. Additionally, it covered 
standard good business practices. The face-to-
face group training was supplemented with an 
interactive mobile phone learning platform.
The research design  in Tanzania allows us to identify 
the impacts of the mobile savings intervention, with and 
without the business training. To do so, we randomly 
assigned about 4,000 women microentrepreneurs 
(operating in Dodoma and Mbeya) into three groups: 
(i) 1,000 women were invited to the mobile savings 
intervention only, (ii) 2,000 women were invited to 
both the mobile savings and the business training 
interventions, and (iii) 1,000 women served as a control 
group. All women were first surveyed in June-July 2016. 
The interventions run from August-November 2016. 
Follow-up surveys took place at one year and at 18 
months after the baseline survey. For the analysis we 
also exploit administrative data on M-Pawa transactions 
made available by Vodacom for all women in the study.
Indonesia
In Indonesia, the mobile savings  intervention also 
promoted access to a new branchless banking 
mobile savings product, but that was dependent on 
the successful operation of a new mobile banking 
network. Unlike in Tanzania where we worked 
directly with women business owners, in Indonesia 
the intervention targeted local bank agents and 
included men and women entrepreneurs. It provided 
agents with enhanced financial incentives for 
signing up new customers, as well as training on 
the product and the importance of targeting female 
customers. The intervention thus targeted the supply 
side of the market for mobile savings, whereas in 
Tanzania we directly targeted the demand side. 
The business training , designed and implemented 
by Mercy Corps Indonesia, invited microentrepreneurs 
for an average 3 hours-long training session on financial literacy with a focus on mobile savings. This 
group session was followed by three group mentoring 
sessions to reinforce the training with practice.
The research design  in Indonesia allows us to identify 
the impacts of the two interventions, separately 
and together. To do so, we followed a two-stage 
randomization procedure. The first stage randomized 
the mobile savings intervention across about 400 
villages (in East Java): the villages were either paired 
with bank agents receiving high (Rp. 10,000, around 
$0.77) or low (Rp. 2,000, or $0.15) monetary incentives 
for signing up new customers. The second stage 
randomized women microentrepreneurs within both 
types of villages into two groups: about 1,600 women 
were invited to the business training intervention, and 
about 1,200 women served as a comparison group. 
Microentrepreneurs were surveyed in two waves, 
with the first wave surveyed in January-February 
2017 and the second in July-November 2017. The 
results below are restricted to half the sample, where 
a majority of the women (77%), were re-interviewed 
in early 2018, a month or less after the last group 
mentoring session (as delays resulted from operational 
challenges in setting up the network, now resolved). 
HERE’S WHAT WE FOUND 
Tanzania
The mobile savings intervention led to firms 
saving more on M-Pawa, and the business training 
enhanced this impact.  Transaction-level data shows 
women in the mobile savings only group saved two 
times more money weekly on M-Pawa than women in 
the control group, while those in the mobile savings + 
business training group saved almost four times more.
Borrowing from M-Pawa also increased. The 
mobile savings intervention led to a 14pp statistically 
significant increase in the likelihood that women 
received a mobile loan. This impact is slightly higher 
among women who received the additional business 
training intervention, though not significantly different.
The increase in mobile savings and loans appear 
to crowd out other types of savings and credit. Survey data show that there are no systematic 
effects on overall savings or loans. Firm owners 
appear to have shifted both savings and loans to 
the mobile platform from other sources, including 
cash savings at home. So although savings balances 
haven’t increased, they appear to be more secure.
The mobile savings intervention led to firms 
opening new businesses.  Women in the mobile 
savings only intervention are 4pp more likely to grow 
their business activities by operating a second business. 
This impact is higher among women who receive the 
additional business training intervention, though not 
significantly different from the mobile-savings only group.
The mobile savings intervention also led to an 
increase in women’s intra-household decision-
making power vis-à-vis their husbands.  Self-
reported data from women who were encouraged 
to open mobile-savings accounts indicates that 
they have greater decision-making power over 
business and household expenditure allocations 
compared to women in the control group. This 
evidence is consistent with mobile savings 
accounts offering greater privacy and security. 
The business training further led to better 
business practices (such as record keeping and 
financial planning), more labor effort and capital 
investment. The marginal impact of adding business 
training to the mobile savings intervention was a 4pp 
increase in the number of good business practices , 
a 2-hour increase in time the woman devotes to work 
per week, and a 23% increase in capital investment. 
Indonesia
The business training increased women’s 
knowledge of mobile money and 
mobile savings and their likelihood of 
opening a mobile savings account. 
The business training in combination with 
the mobile savings intervention led women 
to increase total savings and mobile 
savings. These women increased total savings 
balances by about 24%, including a statistically 
significant 4% increase in mobile savings FOR MORE INFORMATION,

This work was partly funded by a generous grant from the Exxon Mobil Foundation to the Center for Global 
Development. This work has also been funded in part by The Umbrella Facility for Gender Equality (UFGE), a World 
Bank Group multi-donor trust fund expanding evidence, knowledge and data needed to identify and address key 
gaps between men and women to deliver better development solutions that boost prosperity and increase opportunity 
for all. The UFGE has received generous contributions from Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, 
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States..
The researchers would like to acknowledge the ExxonMobil Foundation’s pivotal role in the creation of “She Counts”—a 
global platform that seeks to put financial services in the hands of women business owners. The researchers are 
privileged to provide the evidence that feeds into this partnership.
Photo credit: Marijo Silva and the “She Counts” global platformbalance. Women who only received training and women who were only 
exposed to better paid agents also increased total savings (11 and 7%, 
respectively), but these increases were not statistically significant. 
Women who received training and were served by high-incentive 
agents reported being more empowered, reflected in an index 
of household decision-making.  This empowerment effect seems 
to have been mediated by the increase in savings and mobile savings, 
providing privacy and enhancing women’s economic self-reliance. 
The combination of the two interventions also had positive economic 
welfare effects and increased women’s self-confidence, but there 
were no discernible effects of either intervention alone or combined 
on women’s business outcomes.  Both interventions independently 
increased household assets – women who received training reported a 20% 
increase in household consumer durables (including smartphones and TV 
connection) and women served by high-incentive agents reported a 24% 
increase in these durables. These women likely invested at least part of their 
increased savings in durable household assets. An outstanding question is 
whether increased savings will also be invested in the business over time. 
WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED SO FAR?
Our results suggest that easing supply-side constraints increases the uptake 
of mobile savings accounts by women microentrepreneurs in developing 
countries, and has beneficial economic empowerment effects. However, the 
evidence also shows that without relaxing complementary demand-sided 
constraints that women might face, access to mobile savings accounts 
per se is no silver bullet. Providing women with complementary business 
training bolsters the effectiveness of mobile savings accounts, although 
this is still not enough to improve business profits in the short run. We 
plan to conduct additional follow-up surveys for both the Tanzania and 
Indonesia projects to track longer run effects on business performance.

Abstract: The recent surge of the Fourth Industrial Revolution has set forth demands for a new
generation of the labor force with a comprehensive set of skills to meet the standards of the global
market. Despite widespread concerns about educational reforms and renovations to enhance the
workforce capacity in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) skills, research
into the digital proﬁciencies of students has been limited in Vietnam. This dataset contains 1061
observations on the digital competency level of 10th-grade students in 20 surveyed schools from ﬁve
provinces in Vietnam. The investigation, joining frequentist and Bayesian analyses, aims to provide
valuable insights into the current state of children’s attitudes, behaviors, competency levels, and
use of ICT within the Vietnamese educational context. The values of the dataset lie in its proposed
scientiﬁc framework for replication in multiple regions and contexts as well as the feasibility of
categorical regression techniques together with Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression analysis.
Dataset: The dataset is submitted and will be published as a supplement to this paper.

1. Summary
This manuscript introduces a dataset (Supplementary Materials) of 1061 observations of students
from 20 senior high schools across ﬁve provinces and cities in Vietnam. The dataset was collected
Data 2019 ,4, 69; doi:10.3390 /data4020069 www.mdpi.com /journal /dataData 2019 ,4, 69 2 of 37
as a component of the “Digital Kids Asia Paciﬁc (DKAP)” project that aimed to investigate school
students’ information and communication technology (ICT) competency levels in Asia-Paciﬁc through
four pilot countries: Vietnam, Bangladesh, Fiji, and the Republic of Korea. The DKAP investigation,
implemented by the United Nations Educational, Scientiﬁc, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in
Bangkok within the scope of the “Fostering Digital Citizenship through Safe and Responsible Use of
ICT” Project, seeks to establish concrete understanding of ICT use and competency levels of regional
children by creating and verifying a framework to gather quantitative data reﬂecting their attitudes,
perceptions, proﬁciency, and behavioral use of ICT in an educational setting. The compiled data
include information regarding respondents’ demographic and personal features such as gender, ICT
awareness and access, socioeconomic status, school and neighborhood living standards, and their
digital citizenship competencies.
The goal of this dataset is not only to describe students’ ICT cognitive and non-cognitive skills,
but also to encompass a thorough examination of the relationship between demographic, cognitive,
behavioral, sociocultural, and contextual factors, and the digital competencies of school students.
Utilizing both the frequentist and Bayesian approaches, analyses of these data would shed light on
possible predictive factors and the determinants of ICT proﬁciency as an essential ability of future
global citizens.
This research is particularly crucial to developing economies that rely heavily on technology
transfer to boost technological progress and sustain long-term economic growth [ 1] Research has
conﬁrmed the underlying signiﬁcance of human capital stock in secondary and tertiary levels of
education, as absorption capacity, in facilitating technology transfer [ 1,2]. The ICT skills readiness
of school students is even more critical for low and middle-income economies in the era of Industry
4.0, which presents substantial challenges and opportunities. In Vietnam as a particular case study,
researchers have pointed out the increased risks for the “middle-income trap” where investment will
recede due to the rising labor cost and poor labor-saving technology [ 3]. As Vietnam transits from
traditional entrepreneurship to a new ‘computational entrepreneurship [ 4,5], skill shortages are another
problem facing the Southeast Asian country, with the highest percentage of wage workers at risk due
to automation in the region [ 6]. As of 2016, low skilled workers still took up to over one-third of the
total labor force in the country [ 7], despite a growing demand for information technology (IT) workers
by 47% per year [ 8]. Alongside the possible disruption in growth rates and concerns over the weak
human capital, Vietnam’s cybersecurity is still vulnerable, with a four-fold increase of the number of
cyberattacks and incidents within one year from 2015 to 2016 [ 9]. Vietnam only ranked 101 out of 193
countries in a global cybersecurity index in 2017 [ 10]. Recognizing this peril of falling far behind in
the age of digitalization, the Vietnamese government has made an e ort to improve skills education
for youth, especially technical education [ 11]. In addition to enhancing the competitiveness of the
labor force, digital competencies are also relevant to widespread concerns facing the global community
such as cyberbullying, youth suicide, depression, or behavioral disorders [ 12]. Therefore, ﬁndings
from this dataset are expected to have signiﬁcant implications for the development and evaluation of
management and capacity-building policies in the emerging country.
Within the scope of this text, description of the dataset, including the survey questionnaire,
potential research questions, the research framework, and our data collection procedure will be
presented. Examples of possible statistical model methods and analyses will also be provided.
Limitations and potential implications of the dataset will be discussed in the ﬁnal section of the paper.
2. Data Description
DKAP was proposed as part of UNESCO’s “Enhancing National Capacity to Foster Digital
Citizenship Education in Asia Paciﬁc” project to understand students’ digital competency in the Asia
Paciﬁc region. The project was ﬁnancially supported by the Government of the Republic of Korea
Funds-In-Trust and Google in close cooperation with The International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) and The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF).Data 2019 ,4, 69 3 of 37
The DKAP survey tool has been assessed as reliable and validated to measure digital citizenship
competencies under the DKAP Framework. A total of 5129 responses from children aged 15 from four
countries—Bangladesh, Fiji, South Korea, and Vietnam—have been obtained using the instrument
within the scope of a comparative investigation study of digital citizenship across the pilot countries.
The Vietnam Institute of Educational Sciences (VNIES) became the focal point of the Ministry of
Education and Training to carry out the project component in Vietnam. VNIES signed the contract with
UNESCO Hanoi (N04500363176) to conduct the survey in September 2018 in ﬁve provinces within the
country. The survey questionnaire of the project in Vietnam was translated into Vietnamese from the
English version of the DKAP framework.
The dataset contains responses by 1061 15-year-old school students regarding their digital
competencies. The questionnaire consists of 117 multiple-choice questions, most of which require the
respondents to choose one single answer out of the provided options, while some of the questions
ask for more than one answer. Questions and answers were treated as discrete and continuous
variables and encoded according to the coding instructions provided by UNESCO (see the dataset).
The questions were divided into two groups: group (1), contextual questions; and group (2), digital
competence questions. Group 1 contains 33 items asking for students’ ICT experiences along with
their demographic information. Group 2 contains 84 items concerning students’ ICT competencies
across ﬁve di erent domains.
2.1. Group (1) Personal Background Questions
The 33 question items in group (1) cover three domains: (1) student personal background
(eight items); (2) access and usage of digital devices (18 items); and (3) socioeconomic status (SES)
(seven items).
2.1.1. Domain (1): Student Personal Background
In domain (1), the ﬁrst two questions are ‘Gender’ and ‘Year of birth’. The question of ‘Gender’
oers two options: ‘female’ and ‘male’ (‘F1’). Other questions within this domain ask about
the surveyors’ current study grade level (‘F3’), the language they use (‘F4’), their country (‘F5’),
expected highest level of education(‘F6’), number of days absent from school (‘F7’), and time spent on
outside-school activities (‘F8’).
The distribution of answers for domain (1) questions is presented in Table 1. The percentage of
female participants is slightly higher than male participants (by 6.2%). Nearly all (99%) of the students
were born in 2003, and all were in Grade 10. In the Vietnamese 12-grade education system, these
students were in the ﬁrst year of senior high school.
The question of academic expectation asks about the highest expected education level. The
responses were encoded as variable ‘F6’. Statistics show that the majority of students wished to
complete post-secondary (36%) and masters /doctoral level (33.5%). Distributions of responses to F6 by
gender can be found in Figure 1.Data 2019 ,4, 69 4 of 37

2.1.2. Domain (2): Access and Usage of Digital Devices 
Regarding students’ access and usage of digital devices, the first question in domain (2) on 
students’ “experience of using digital devices” yields  four values: ‘never’, ‘l ess than 1 year’, ‘1–2 
years’, ‘3–4 years’, and ‘more than 5 years’ (‘G1’). The other questions in this domain collect information about the frequency of students’ Internet access from a digital device (‘G2’); the location from which they are connected to the Internet (‘G3 ’), the types of digital devices used for Internet 
connection from home (‘G4’), school  (‘G5’), or a local community access point (‘G6’); the type of

The responses to questions on the purposes of computer and Internet usage were encoded as
continuous variables ‘G13’, ‘G14’, ‘G15’, and ‘G16’. Statistics indicate that the modal value for ‘G13’ is
1–2 h of computer and Internet usage per day for school study purposes.
Figure 2 depicts the distribution of values for variable ‘G14’ about the amount of time spent online
or using computer by gender. The horizontal axis refers to the provided di erent time lengths. The
blue columns represent the number of female students, and the red columns represent the number of
male students. It can be seen that a large number of students spent between one and two hours online
for personal study purposes (55%). It also seems that female students preferred spending more hours
online or using a computer than their male counterparts.Data 2019 ,4, 69 10 of 37

Regarding the level of help and support from others, less than a quarter of parents /caregivers
were perceived as being highly concerned for their children’s cyber safety (‘H6_1’). The level of
encouragement from parents, teachers, peers, and siblings for the students’ online learning activities
also seem to be low (‘H7’).
2.2. Group (2) Competency Questions
The purpose of group (2) questions is to learn about competency level in using digital technology
and the capacity to manage potential risks caused by digital technology. This group comprises ﬁve
domains and corresponding component capacities: Digital Literacy, Digital Safety and Resilience,
Digital Participation and Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creativity and Innovation (see
the dataset).
The Digital Literacy domain consists of 14 questions assessing the use of tools and digital
information: for example, the ability to use software and digital devices and exploit digital information
in dierent contexts. Assessing scale is in the form of a four-point Likert scale measuring the extent
to which students can exploit tools and digital information. The visual distribution of responses for
this variable is displayed in Figure 3a. The modal option is ‘agree a little’ to the ability to use digital
tools and information, followed by an almost 30% proportion of the respondents claiming to ‘agree a
lot’, meaning highly conﬁdent in their ability to handle digital tools and information. Besides, theData 2019 ,4, 69 14 of 37
distribution of gender in each choice is relatively homologous. The mean scores by gender in the
Digital Literacy domain is around 3.1 (Figure 3b).

 encouragement from parents, teachers, peers, and sibl ings for the students’ online learning activities 
also seem to be low (‘H7’). 
2.2. Group (2) Competency Questions 
The purpose of group (2) questions is to learn about competency level in using digital technology 
and the capacity to manage potential risks caused by digital technology. This group comprises five 
domains and corresponding component capacities: Di gital Literacy, Digital Safety and Resilience, 
Digital Participation and Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creativity and Innovation (see the dataset).  
The Digital Literacy domain consists of 14 questions assessing the use of tools and digital 
information: for example, the ab ility to use software and digital devices and exploit digital 
information in different contexts. Assessing scale is in the form of a four-point Likert scale measuring 
the extent to which students can exploit tools and digital information. The visual distribution of 
responses for this variable is displayed in Figure 3a. The modal option is ‘agree a little’ to the ability to use digital tools and information, followed by  an almost 30% proportion of the respondents 
claiming to ‘agree a lot’, meaning highly confident in their ability to handle digital tools and information. Besides, the distribution of gender in each choice is relatively homologous. The mean scores by gender in the Digital Literacy domain is around 3.1 (Figure 3b).

Similarly, the other four domains (Digital Safety and Resilience, Digital Participation and 
Agency, Digital Emotional Intelligence, and Creati vity and Innovation) also  employ a four-point 
Likert scale to evaluate the corresponding capaci ties. Figure 4 illustrates the distributions of 
responses in each of the domains. 
The Digital Safety and Resilience domain includes 18 questions examining students’ 
understanding about digital rights, privacy protecti on, well-being, and risk management ability in 
the digital world. Figure 4a is the histogram of me an scores, which suggests that most of the students 
felt that they understood their rights, and knew ho w to protect their privacy and react to potential 
risk in the digital world. Figure 4b shows a small discrepancy in re sponses between girls and boys in 
this domain.

The distribution of students’ answers to questions in the Digital Emotional Intelligence domain is
displayed in Figure 6a. This domain consists of 16 questions aiming to assess students’ interpersonal
skills and awareness when joining the digital world (i.e., their use of social networking sites and
real-time chatting apps). The histogram of mean scores demonstrates that most of the answers fall into
the range of “agree a little” to “agree a lot”, meaning that the students showed ﬁrm understanding and
awareness of legitimate cyber behaviors. The mean score in this domain is not high (around three),
with a narrow gap between answers by boys and girls (Figure 6b).Data 2019 ,4, 69 16 of 37

2.3. Potential Research Questions
Use of the Internet or digital devices at home is a vital factor inﬂuencing primary students’ ICT
literacy [ 13]. Speciﬁcally, a study in German primary schools suggested a lack of parental concern for
the online behaviors of their children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds [ 14]. Moreover, it is not
easy to obtain the goal of digital equity among students from di erent backgrounds [ 15]. In general, a
higher level of self-e ciency is associated with a better level of self-perceived digital competencies [ 16].
Regarding gender, there are di erences in the basic digital competencies of male and female university
students [17]. Drawing on the dataset, we present potential research questions in the following list.
 What are the background factors that could a ect students’ digital competency levels?
 How do socioeconomic conditions a ect students’ digital competency levels?
 What are the factors related to the access and usage of digital devices that could a ect the digital
competencies of students in any domains?
 Is there any relationship between high academic expectation and students’ digital
competency levels?
 Is there any correlation among the ﬁve domains of digital competencies?
 Are there any di erences in the digital competency levels of male and female school students?Data 2019 ,4, 69 18 of 37

3. Methods
3.1. Research Framework
This research is theoretically based on Bronfenbrenner’s bio-ecological model, which describes
a child’s maturity in interactions with multiple levels of sociodemographic, cultural, and societal
elements that constitute his or her community [ 18]. In particular, the model proposes four layers of the
environment with a respective impact on a child’s cognitive growth.
As illustrated in Figure 8, the innermost circle represents a microsystem that contains the developing
individual together with their personal and closest ties. The next layer is a mesosystem involving the
interdependence of the microsystems with which the developing individual actively interacts (e.g.,
the child’s interrelationship between home and school environments). This is accommodated in an
ecosystem with contexts having indirect and distant e ects on the developing child. The outermost
layer macrosystem encompasses systematic cross-cultural compatibilities together with philosophies or
ideologies that reinforce the structure.

Given the scarcity and underdevelopment of  theoretical explanations for children’s 
development of digital competencies, Bronfenbrenn er’s bio-ecological model serves as a useful 
framework by offering a child-centered approach to  examine children’s behaviors, knowledge, or 
attitudes relating to ICT, considering multiple layers of social impacts, and illustrated in the form of concentric circles of family, schools, or community and culture. 
The framework employed in this study pr oposes three sets of interconnections: 
o Personal level within the microsystem; 
o Social mediation level, primaril y concerning home, school syst em, and peer networks within 
the mesosystem; and 
o National level where the country is the subject of analysis, and the macro levels of 
socioeconomic classification, systems of regula tion, and cultural values act as influential 
factors. 
The Conference on Digital Citizenship Education in Asia-Pacific and the subsequent experts’ 
meeting have proposed a detailed framework of digital citizenship domains, proficiencies, and 
performance indicators to comprise a wide paramete r of essential competencies for a digital citizen 
to adapt to, develop, and serve the digital community in the 21st century. An itemized description of the framework is provided in Table A1, Appendix A. Definitions of the five suggested domains are listed in Table 5 below.

3.2. Data Collection
The research team strictly followed UNESCO’s procedure for the survey: (1) Organizing the
consultancy workshop in July 2018 to review and develop the adapted version of the survey
questionnaire; (2) Conducting the pilot test for the survey questionnaire at two schools in Hanoi and
making necessary amendments in August 2018; (3) Contacting the target school administrators and
coordinators and carrying out administrative work for the investigation; (4) Implementing the survey
with the support of school coordinators in September 2018 at 20 schools across provinces in Vietnam;
(5) Cleaning and encoding the data from 18 September to 1 October 2018, according to the codebook
and coding instructions (see the dataset) provided by UNESCO Bangkok.
The sample geographical locations are indicated in the map in Figure 9. In total, the survey
covered 1061 high school students (See Table A2, Appendix A) from 20 schools located in ﬁve provinces
and cities: Lao Cai, Hanoi, Danang, Lam Dong, and Can Tho.
3.3. Data Analysis
Raw data gathered from the questionnaire were entered into a spreadsheet at data.csv (see the
dataset). Then, the data were processed and saved in CSV format for analyses using R statistical
software (v3.5.3). Both frequentist and Bayesian statistics approaches were employed in the data
analysis process.
3.3.1. Frequentist Analysis
Since the majority of variables in the dataset are categorical, most of the responses and predictor
variables are discrete; thus, it’s appropriate to use logistic regression model for data analysis [ 19,20]. In
the logistic regression model, we use the two following equations:
lnj(x)
J(x)=j+T
jx,j=1,:::,J 1Data 2019 ,4, 69 22 of 37
In which xis the independent variable, and j(x)=P(Y=jx)is the corresponding probability.
Therefore,j=P
Yij=1
, with Yas the dependent variable.

endorsed Convention on the Rights of the Child , which constitutes a common reference on human 
rights standards for children.

and coding instructions (see the da taset) provided by UNESCO Bangkok. 
The sample geographical locations are indicated in  the map in Figure 9. In total, the survey 
covered 1061 high school students  (See Table A2, Appendix A) from 20 schools located in five 
provinces and cities: Lao Cai, Hanoi, Danang, Lam Dong, and Can Tho.

Besides, the data can be analyzed by a linear regression model for the numerical variables. The
general equation of the linear equation is:
Y=+1X1+kXk
where Yis a continuous variable; and the independent variables Xican be concrete, categorical,
or continuous.
The linear regression method is applied with the outcome variable being digital resilience (from
‘B15’ to ‘B18’), the father’s highest level of education (‘H2’), the student’s expectation of highestData 2019 ,4, 69 23 of 37
education level (‘F6’), and time spent using digital devices (‘G1’) as predictor variables. The regression
coecients are reported in Table 6.

3.3.2. Bayesian Analysis
The Bayesian statistics approach will also be used to examine the dataset in this section. A
hierarchical regression model of the amount of experience that students have with using digital devices
(‘G1’) according to their schools and sex was developed by employing R statistical software and
BayesVL package (v0.7.5), which is available in [ 21]. Similar applications of Bayesian statistics can
be found in [ 22,23]. The Bayesian approach is strong in visually demonstrating the results and the
distributions of the coe cients. Moreover, the robustness of the model is tested by analysis of the
sensitivity of the model to prior change. Its credibility is evident when the model does not show
sensitivity to adjustment of the prior [24–27].
The mathematical formula of the model is as follows:
G1[i] =alpha[i,j] +beta_sex * sex[i]
In which j =20 schools, and G1 is the student’s experiences in using digital devices: 1 =Never; 2
=Less than 1 year; 3 =1–2 years; 4 =3–4 years; and 5 =More than 5 years.
Examples of codes that were used to command the BayesVL package to construct the model are
as follows:
Box 1
# Design the model
model <- bayesvl()
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “G1”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “sex”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addNode(model, “schoolid”, “norm”)
model <- bvl_addArc(model, “schoolid”, “G1”, “varint”)
model <- bvl_addArc(model, “sex”, “G1”, “slope”)
# Generate the stan code for model
model_string <- bvl_model2Stan(model)
cat(model_string)
# Fit the model
ﬁt<- bvl_modelFit(model, dkap_data, warmup =2000, iter =20000, chains =4, cores =1)
Moreover, the STAN codes that were generated by the BayesVL package for the model sampling
and parameter learning are:Data 2019 ,4, 69 25 of 37

4. Conclusions and User Notes
Our dataset o ers comprehensive descriptive statistics yielding signiﬁcant insights regarding
digital citizenship competencies in the Vietnamese educational context, speciﬁcally school students’
perceptions, proﬁciency levels, and behavioral use of ICT. This research area has rarely been studied
in the ﬁeld of Social Sciences and Humanities, despite potential challenges concerning professional
development facing developing countries such as Vietnam in the age of Industry 4.0. With over 100
question items collecting information across the ﬁve domains—Digital Literacy, Digital Safety and
Resilience, Digital Emotional Intelligence, Creativity and Innovation, and Digital Participation and
Agency—the dataset contains values of multiple variables, both categorical and continuous, hence
allowing potential diverse methodologies of in-depth analyses and the strict control of variables.
The richness of our dataset would foster further research on multifaceted domains of digital
competencies in adolescents. Promising grounds for future investigations include the e ects of
school-related factors such as curriculum, teaching practices, syllabi or assessment criteria and format,
as well as non-educational factors concerning demographic backgrounds, daily time-spending routines,
or online behavioral activities. Research into these areas is critical, as ICT skills have been identiﬁed
as one of the major barriers to students and teachers’ readiness for STEM (Sciences, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) education [ 28]. Scientiﬁc ﬁndings regarding the determinants of both
the cognitive and the non-cognitive attributes of the ICT competency of students would comprehensively
inform future decisions and suggestions for policy development, particularly in the education sector in
developing countries with similar socioeconomic structures to Vietnam [29].
In addition to presenting the dataset, this article also explores statistical methods for data analysis,
which is categorical data in this dataset. Traditionally, the frequentist approach is used for data
analysis. However, as the scientiﬁc community is debating over the traditional approach, due to
the manipulation of statistical signiﬁcance and other misconducts such as stargazing, p-hacking, or
HARKing [ 30], we also introduce the application of Bayesian statistics for hierarchical regression
analysis. The employment of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches are expected to strengthen
the credibility and soundness of scientiﬁc results produced from the dataset, which would pique the
interests of the scientiﬁc community and policymakers.Data 2019 ,4, 69 30 of 37
The values of this dataset are beyond the instant analyses of data, considering its high replicability
of methodology and the survey framework in di erent regions and contexts. As stated earlier in this
text, the study was originally designed to make a cross-national comparison of data in four countries:
Bangladesh, South Korea, Vietnam, and Fiji. The ﬁndings derived from this dataset would be more
generalizable if the target sample is extended to include more observations from students at di erent
levels of study rather than limited to only 10th graders. A more comprehensive sample, which is
entirely feasible in the future, would allow interesting cross-regional and cross-generational ﬁndings
on a panoramic scale.
Therefore, replicating the survey framework to yield comparable datasets would contribute to
a cross-boundary database with immense scientiﬁc implications. Knowledge sharing, open access
to data and information are also aligned with the current movements in the academic world that
resulted from better communication and connection concerning international collaboration in research,
transparency of data processing, and Open Science [ 31,32]. It is not unusual nowadays that studies
with groundbreaking ﬁndings are attained by large research groups from all over the world, such as
the picture of the black hole [ 33] or the large dataset of societies [ 34]. All these changes will ultimately
address the global sustainable development goals of United Nations. This is also the original aim of
this investigation by UNESCO, and the reason why the organization approved the dissemination and
access of this dataset.

ABSTRACT
Financial knowledge is critical for making sound decisions that foster financial health and protect  
consumers from predation. A widely-used tool for building this capability is financial education. 
Yet evidence suggests that conventional approaches which teach concepts in classroom-style 
settings are ineffective and expensive at scale, especially for lower-income users. More recent 
findings indicate  that customizing financial education to the needs, interests, and location of 
participants may increase  impact, though doing so in a cost-effective and scalable way remains 
challenging. This randomized  evaluation of a tablet-based financial education program with 
mostly female recipients of a conditional  cash transfer (CCT) program in Colombia offers 
evidence for how to design and scale an effective  digital-based financial education program. 
Results indicate that the LISTA Initiative had significant  positive impacts on financial 
knowledge, attitudes, practices, and performance, increasing for poorer, less educated, and more 
rural populations, with users exhibiting increased financial health over two years later. Critical 
mechanisms included well-designed content and a social learning component.  Yet the longer-
term impact on formal financial inclusion was limited, suggesting the possible benefits  of 
combining supply-side solutions with financial education interventions.

and Mitchell, 2014). This empirical relationship has provided justication for nancial education
interventions, which seek to transfer information, knowledge, and skills for managing nancial
ows.1Yet evidence of the impact of nancial education programs and human capital theories of
nancial knowledge indicate that the relationship between nancial literacy and nancial outcomes
is more complex than a simple case of cause (Hastings et al., 2013; Lusardi et al., 2017).
Evidence of the eects of nancial education remains mixed (Fernandes et al., 2014; Miller
et al., 2015; Kaiser and Menkho, 2017). Comparisons are dicult because program design and
quality vary based on user type, objectives, content, channel, intensity, and duration, to name a
few. Interventions targeting rural farmers in Rwanda, adolescents in Brazilian high schools, and
military enlistees at their place of work in the United Sates will dier. Regardless, some lessons have
emerged as meta-analytic reviews have incorporated more experimental evidence and adopted more
rigorous analytic methods. Financial education has been shown to increase knowledge, savings, and
record-keeping, domains in which the user has more control, compared to debt (Miller et al., 2015;
Kaiser and Menkho, 2017). Consistent impact is harder to create among lower-income participants
in developing countries as well as among higher-income users in more developed countries (Kaiser
and Menkho, 2017). Studies reveal that the number of hours of program exposure, i.e., intensity,
relates to impact (Miller et al., 2015; Kaiser and Menkho, 2017). Despite evidence of a nancial
literacy gender gap favoring males, dierential impacts by gender have not been found (Kaiser
and Menkho, 2017), (Bucher-Koenen et al., 2017). People with greater self-ecacy or locus of
control appear to benet more from nancial education (Fernandes et al., 2014; Miller et al., 2015),
suggesting that programs should also target psychological components. Although nancial tasks
dier depending upon where one is in the life cycle, no systematic age eects emerge (Kaiser and
Menkho, 2017).
Human capital theories, which model the endogenous relationship between nancial literacy and
nancial outcomes over the life cycle, propose explanations for how and when interventions may
have impact (Jappelli and Padula, 2013; Lusardi et al., 2017). Model predictions for the United
States show that the dierential life-cycle investment in nancial knowledge among income groups
with varying returns explains between 30 and 40 percent of retirement wealth inequality (Lusardi
et al., 2017). If social insurance programs exist, it may be rational for the lower-income population
to not invest in nancial literacy (Hubbard et al., 1995; Lusardi et al., 2017). Finally, the stock
of nancial literacy early in life is predicted to deliver compounded returns across the life-cycle
(Jappelli and Padula, 2013; Lusardi et al., 2017). The above models oer an explanation for why
interventions among lower-income populations may lead to less impact and why it may be more
1For example, results from the Financial Development Barometer, an online poll conducted for the 2014 World
Bank Global Financial Development Report (GFDR), indicated that over 60 percent of ocials from 21 developed
and 54 developing economies asserted that nancial education was the most eective way to increase nancial access
to lower-income citizens (see Miller et al., 2015).
1cost-eective to focus on nancial literacy earlier in life.
Regardless, what some considered the disappointing results of nancial education interventions
(Willis, 2011) led to a focus on the larger concept of nancial inclusion and supply-side components
(Hastings et al., 2013). In developing countries, for example, scholars and practitioners have part-
nered to apply behavioral economic principles to product redesigns targeting limited self-control
and inattention. Commitment devices have proven eective, especially those of the soft variety,
such as labeled accounts, lock-boxes, and triggers (Ashraf et al., 2006; Duo et al., 2011; Dupas
and Robinson, 2013; Brune et al., 2017). Changes in behavior may also reverse the direction of
the causal relationship between nancial education programs and practices. While human capital
theories have not disentangled whether knowledge leads to behavior or behavior to knowledge, im-
pact evaluations of product redesigns oer evidence for the latter. In Rural Kenya, the eects of
a temporary incentive to save can persist for at least three years after the intervention (Schaner,
2018). In Afghanistan, default assignment into a savings treatment shifted attitudes towards saving
and increased the likelihood of doing so 18 months after the experiment ended. The authors suggest
that the experience of benets from saving helped change perceptions (Blumenstock et al., 2018).
Yet supply-side interventions, such as the savings products described above, may still leave
unaddressed an important goal of nancial education: empowering consumers to take control of
their nancial lives, improve their decisions, and protect themselves against predation (Hastings
et al., 2013). These issues are particularly relevant given expanding global access to the formal
nancial system. In developing countries, consumer empowerment and protection become even
more critical with government adoption of nancial inclusion policies (many of which are tied to
cash transfer programs) and technological innovations (such as mobile banking and digital payment
services), which increase the number of people entering the formal nancial system (Karlan et al.,
2016a; Demirguc-Kunt et al., 2017). One estimate claims that three of every four newly banked
global poor had never received any form of nancial training (Deb and Kubzansky, 2012). Merely
banking the unbanked is thus not enough (Dupas et al., 2018). Just as nancial education gave
way to nancial inclusion, practitioners have begun to reconsider the objectives and implications of
nancial inclusion policies and refocus on nancial health, the ability to create and manage nancial
systems that protect against shocks and create opportunities (CSFI, 2017; Prabhajar, 2018).
As nancial access increases for lower-income populations, the lack of nancial literacy or capa-
bility may hinder optimal use of new products or, at worst, leave consumers vulnerable to predatory
services, as seen in the sub-prime mortgage crisis in the United States or microcredit overindebt-
edness crises in Nicaragua and India (Gu erin et al., 2015; Mader, 2015; Bateman et al., 2018).2A
critical challenge, especially in developing countries, is how to oer impactful, cost-eective, and
scalable nancial education that helps lower-income citizens become more informed consumers who
can use newly accessed nancial services to better leverage their earned or transferred resources to
2Beyond supply- and demand-side interventions, regulation is a third option for protecting consumers against
predatory nancial practices, as seen with the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the United
States (Hastings et al., 2013). See also Gine et al. (2014) and Fort et al. (2016) for studies on the inuence of bank
nancial information disclosure a practice which may be regulated by authorities.
2improve their nancial health.
In this paper, we estimate the impact of a tablet-based application that incorporated simplied,
concrete, targeted, timely, engaging, and interactive content on savings and budgeting via a delivery
method that relied on local community leaders to rotate the tablets among mostly female recipients
ofM as Familias en Acci on , a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program in Colombia.3As the
evaluation sample is followed over time and the survey data are linked to bank administrative and
credit system records, we are able to track how the intervention's impacts on a variety of outcomes
change over time. The data's richness allows us to interpret the observed eects and their evolution.
Our results show that the intervention had signicant positive impacts on nancial knowledge,
attitudes, practices, and performance, translating into increased nancial health 25 months after
the end of the intervention. Although the impacts on certain outcomes were stronger immediately
following and seven months after the intervention ended, for a subset of outcomes we nd persistent
positive impacts. For a few outcomes, the impacts observed 25 months after the intervention are
actually higher than those observed at just following it. Initially, women who received the LISTA
tablets demonstrated better understanding of savings and budgeting concepts, expressed stronger
preferences for saving formally rather than informally, reported more trust in banks, and professed
more optimism in general. LISTA participants were also more likely to set savings goals, felt more
capable of teaching others how to use ATMs, and reported more informal savings. These results,
based on self-report, are mirrored in administrative bank data, which also indicated higher savings
account balances three months after the intervention. Seven months after the intervention, many
of the impacts held but with smaller magnitudes. When measured 25 months after the intervention
concluded, the impact on knowledge, attitudes, and practices waned and even disappeared in some
cases, yet the impact on savings strengthened while the use of formal credit, based on credit history
administrative data, decreased.
We also observe some heterogeneity in the impacts. In general, estimated impacts are larger for
poorer, less educated, younger, and more rural populations. These heterogeneous patterns seen over
time are consistent with a story that explains the intervention's eects as resulting from providing
important information to the households that needed it most.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 situates the study within the
existing evidence-base on what works or could work within nancial education programs and in-
troduces the policy context, target population, and tablet program. Sections 3 and 4 outline the
experimental design and empirical strategy. Section 5 presents the main results before exploring
heterogeneous eects and possible mechanisms in section 6. Section 7 concludes.
2 Financial Education and the LISTA Program
Eective nancial intermediation via formal or informal savings, credit or insurance markets is
crucial for any household, be they a suburban home in the United States or semi-subsistence
3Although the MFA program targets women, there are a minority of male beneciaries. In our study sample, 91
percent were female.
3families in the Peruvian Amazon. Access to and the ability to operate eciently in such markets
is especially critical for lower-income families, who struggle to match volatile and unpredictable
income streams with volatile and unpredictable spending needs (Collins et al., 2009). Yet enabling
for smoothing and overcoming shocks to current income in order to ensure survival is only part of
the task of public policy and welfare systems. To escape poverty and vulnerability, poor households
also face the challenge of accumulating savings to invest in human or business capital, with the hope
of increasing income over the long-term. Financing these investments requires good understanding
of the importance of saving and nancial access. If lower-income households can access and navigate
comfortably nancial systems that smooth income and consumption, protect them against shocks,
and enable investment, then they may be considered as nancially healthy (CSFI, 2017).
Since credit and insurance markets are often imperfect or inaccessible for poor households
(Karlan and Morduch, 2010; Morduch, 1995), savings mobilization may be perceived as the most
viable option for creating nancial health. Regardless, supply-side barriers to savings remain,
given account opening or maintenance fees, transportation costs, inconvenience, or poorly designed
products, which fail to take into account client needs or behavioral biases. Demand-side barriers
to savings include decision biases as well as a lack of consumer information, knowledge, attitudes,
preferences, and skills, all of which may aect the adoption of formal or informal savings practices
and hinder usage following take-up (Karlan et al., 2014).
The LISTA para Ahorrar or \Ready to Save"" program was created with the premise that
generating savings was the most eective tool for supporting poor households in Latin America.
Designed by Fundaci on Capital, the intervention grew out of a regional initiative, Proyecto Capital ,
which sought to leverage Latin America's conditional cash transfer (CCT) infrastructure by com-
bining automatic opening of bank accounts (supply) with nancial education (demand) to promote
savings.4Proyecto Capital emerged in the mid-2000s amid the movement towards delivery of cash
transfers via bank accounts and wariness of microcredit approaches to poverty reduction. At that
time, Latin American governments had created and expanded CCT programs focusing on education
and child health, with evidence of impact.5Meanwhile, mixed evidence of microcredit's impact
started to appear (Morduch and Roodman, 2014; Banerjee et al., 2015). Some argued that micro-
credit might be more benecial for people living above the extreme poverty threshold, while CCT
programs were better suited for the nancially vulnerable (Panteli c, 2011). In parallel, Fundaci on
Capital's founders gained experience with a rural women's savings programs in the Peruvian Andes
(FIDA, 2004b,a; Edge Finance, 2007). This conuence led to the founding of Proyecto Capital .6
A central challenge for Fundaci on Capital was how to leverage the CCT infrastructure to oer
impactful, cost-eective nancial education at scale. The organization concluded that any solution

America see Handa and Davis (2006); for a systematic global review see Bastagli et al. (2016).
6Funded by the Ford Foundation and IDRC, the initiative rested on the argument that increased savings would
help users smooth consumption, buer against shocks, and invest in human and productive capital, while the targeting
of women was seen as the most eective way to improve resource use and break the household reproduction of poverty
(Duo, 2012; Alm as et al., 2018). See Maldonado (2018) for reections on the program's learnings.
4required moving away from traditional, in-person interventions, which called for a physical space,
skilled instructors, and printed materials (Cohen and Nelson, 2011), and risked low participation
rates since beneciaries incur transportation and opportunity costs to attend multiple sessions (e.g.,
Seshan and Yang, 2012).
Fundaci on Capital sought to \free"" nancial education via a tablet-based application guided
by three principles: tablet use would not require the physical presence of a trainer since the pupil
would bring the teacher (the tablet) into the home; users could work through the content at their
own pace; and tablet use may foster content customization since people could focus on topics
most relevant to them. Piloting began in Colombia in 2012, with a second version tested in 2014.
The result was an evidence-based intervention which incorporated simplied, actionable, concrete,
targeted, timely, engaging, and interactive content via a delivery method that relied on a network
of local female community leaders, a trusted channel which could activate social learning.
LISTA 's approach and original content was developed from the lessons learned in a variety
of contexts. Although traditional nancial education programs often provide broad theoretical
content, concrete, simplied and focused messages are better retained and more actionable (e.g.,
Soman and Zhao, 2011; Ulk umen and Cheema, 2011). A randomized evaluation in the Dominican
Republic, for example, revealed that the teaching of rules of thumb to micro-entrepreneurs not
only made the tips easier to remember but spurred action, resulting in dierences in practices and
revenues compared to a control and traditional education treatment (Drexler et al., 2014).
Meta-analysis also suggests that nancial education has more impact in domains where people
have greater control, such as budgeting and savings, with less impact in areas contingent on the
decisions of other actors, such as loan default (Miller et al., 2015). Furthermore, since omitted psy-
chometric variables such as self-ecacy and self-control may relate to improved outcomes (Hsiaw,
2013), more explicit focus on these elements may complement traditional content (Fernandes et al.,
2014). For example, a focus on goal-setting, which aects self-control, has proven eective for
encouraging savings (Carpena et al., 2017; Soman and Zhao, 2011; Ulk umen and Cheema, 2011).
Content conveyed via emotions and stories are better remembered and acted upon. Laboratory
experiments nd that fear makes people more risk-averse and anger spurs more risk seeking (Lerner
and Keltner, 2001), while sadness creates a myopic focus (Lerner et al., 2013) and fosters more
consumption (Garg and Lerner, 2013). For example, conveying disgust and sadness via lm clips
has led to dierential buying and selling decisions in laboratory settings (Lerner et al., 2004).
Likewise, stories are intimately linked to memory and action (e.g., Tulving, 2002, for episodic
memory). Exposure to soap operas which use emotionally-laden storytelling techniques has had
eects on divorce (Chong and Ferrara, 2009) and fertility rates (La Ferrara et al., 2012). Finally, the
seeding of nancial education content in a South African soap opera increased nancial knowledge
and shifted borrowing and credit-use habits (Berg and Zia, 2017). Given message recall, the authors
hypothesize that the story-driven emotional connection was critical for generating impact.
Content is also made more engaging via practice and interaction, such as gamication, which
taps into distinct learning pathways, i.e., learning by doing or experiential learning (Kolb, 2014).
5Games may be particularly useful in low-literacy contexts as an alternative learning channel, though
to our knowledge the eld still lacks rigorous evidence of gamication's impact.
Finally, timing matters. First, information or reminders that are made just-in-time when people
are about to make decisions have a greater likelihood of impact (Karlan et al., 2016b). Second,
longer and more intense programs may improve results (Miller et al., 2015; Kaiser and Menkho,
2017; Lusardi et al., 2017), but there is a trade-o. Programs with longer duration can increase
costs and attrition.
In sum, simplied, actionable, concrete, targeted, and timely content that taps into emotions
and stories may be more eective, and both, like gamication, are more engaging and thus more
motivating for users. Together these components may enhance retention while spurring behavior.
The LISTA tablet-based application incorporated these insights. Repeated testing resulted in
simplied content with a focus on savings and budget management, as well as information on
the participating bank and the CCT program (see Appendix A). Simple, concrete, and actionable
goal-focused messages were developed and reinforced by integrating audio, inspirational testimonial
videos, educational games, and interactive ATM and mobile banking simulators. The use of multiple
media sought to overcome literacy barriers and provide an entertaining educational experience,
while empowering users through messaging and technology use. With tablet access, users could
review the content as much or little as they wanted within a time frame. Since the application
did not require Internet access, it was readily accessible even in remote rural areas. Finally, after
the tablet intervention, SMS nudge messages were timed to be sent just before and after the MFA
program's bi-monthly cash transfers.
But the impact of even well-designed content will be blunted if not delivered well. The degree
of trust that the receiver has of the messenger is critical for the attention given to the message
(Pornpitakpan, 2006). In nancial education, the trust users have in a program or its channels
(i.e., radio, television, SMS) may aect both take-up and perception of the program's utility. Social
learning interventions also serve as a kind of channel in their ability to amplify messages via peers
and networks (Duo and Saez, 2003; Beshears et al., 2015). In other contexts the use of \near-peers""
have been useful for mentoring in secondary and higher education settings since pupils identify more
with the near-peer, are more likely to trust the shared information, and are communicated to in a
register that pupils better understand (Bulte et al., 2007; Terrion and Leonard, 2007).
To reach as many people as possible in Colombia, Fundaci on Capital experimented with several
implementation strategies, before selecting a rotation approach. In Colombia, as in other contexts,
the CCT beneciaries, which include the 20 percent poorest households, elect a representative as
a local leader and spokesperson for the program. As the cash transfers are targeted predominantly
to women, in Colombia these representatives are called madre l deres or \mother leaders.""7These
local representatives are responsible for communicating MFA program information to, on average,
the 20 to 80 women they represent. Furthermore, the madre l der organizes periodic meetings
of the program beneciaries, where a number of activities are planned. This infrastructure had
7In Mexico they are known as vocales orpromotoras .
6already been used to deliver successfully other interventions such as home visiting programs for
early childhood development, as discussed in Attanasio et al. (2014), who report that the madres
l deres are typically better educated and generally better o than the average beneciary.
Fundaci on Capital thus decided to use this infrastructure to deliver the intervention. The tablet
was thus rotated for a month by madres l deres among beneciary mothers within their group,
either by visiting their homes and leaving the tablet for one or two nights and/or by convening
mothers to their homes or community centers where they completed the tablet training in groups.
After one month, a facilitator retrieved the tablet and rotated it with a new madre l der in the
municipality. On average, madres l deres reached 20 mothers per month. For the LISTA para
Ahorrar program, tablets were distributed to madres l deres in 30 municipalities, reaching 100,000
program beneciaries. The intervention was also combined with distribution of a physical LISTA
kit, which included calendars with stickers to create a savings plan and simplied accounting books,
both of which sought to scaold new behavior. Finally, 14 SMS messages were sent to a subset
of the tablet recipients over a four-month period after the tablet intervention, with the goal of
reinforcing knowledge and reminding users to save (see section 9 in the Supplementary Material
document).
3 Experimental Design
The experimental design estimates the impact that the LISTA treatment has on nancial knowl-
edge, attitudes, practice adoption, and performance relative to a control group. To estimate these
impacts we designed a cluster randomised controlled trial, where the randomization was performed
across a number of municipalities. The experiment's cluster design avoids spillover eects between
treated and untreated madres l deres which could have biased the estimates of the impacts. As a
municipality is randomized either into treatment or control groups, subjects in the latter cannot
be aected by the program being implemented with beneciaries they know.
3.1 Municipality Selection
Municipalities were selected based on government and research criteria. Prosperidad Social , the
government entity responsible for the M as Familias en Acci on (MFA) program, wanted to target
the most vulnerable population. Eligible municipalities therefore needed to be category 3 or 4,
according to Colombian state law, which meant that they were medium or small in population
and budget size. The municipality's Multidimensional Poverty Index needed to be greater than
66.5 percent, ensuring that the average target population in the municipality was \vulnerable""
compared to the national average of 24.8 percent. At least 2,600 MFA beneciaries needed to live
in each municipality, permitting the program to reach 100,000 beneciaries. At least one active
bank or ATM machine needed to exist in the municipality, providing the population with at least
minimal access to the formal nancial system, though participants in remote areas may have still
had diculties accessing these nancial channels. No other government-related nancial education
7programs could be active in the municipality. Finally, municipalities needed to be geographically
proximate to minimize operational costs. Sixty municipalities distributed among eight departments
in Colombia's two poorest regions, the Caribbean and Pacic, met these criteria (see Appendix B).8
To ensure covariate balance among the treatment and control municipalities, randomization
blocks were created based on region (Caribbean or Pacic), average poverty marker or SISBEN
points9at the municipality level, and distance to closest department capital. Block randomization
helped account for economic vulnerability, access to nancial markets, and geography, with the
latter also proxying for sub-national cultural dierences. A 2x2x2 stratication was created; within
each, municipalities were randomized into control and treatment.10
3.2 Beneciary Selection
We developed a strategy to identify the beneciaries most likely to receive the tablet in the control
and treatment municipalities. Several elements were considered: LISTA was a voluntary program
oered to madres l deres of a group of existing MFA beneciaries, the selected sample had to be
statistically identical between control and treatment municipalities, and baseline surveys had to
occur before the intervention. Given the role madres l deres played in the nal selection of LISTA
users, we created a list of the beneciaries most likely to be selected by the madres l deres .
MFA beneciaries are organized into groups ranging from on average 20 to 80, with each led
by a madre l der . Based on pilots of the LISTA rotation methodology, one tablet was estimated to
reach 20 and 30 beneciaries. Given this, 11 madres l deres per municipality were randomly selected
and contacted. They were asked to identify 18 to 21 beneciaries in their group who they would
consider approaching to participate in a generic nancial training program. From those identied
beneciaries, four to six were randomly selected and surveyed at baseline, with the expectation of
some sample attrition, especially during the rst approximation. Since data indicated whether the
madres l deres were in rural or urban environments, a representative selection of madres l deres
was ensured. Overall, 615 madres l deres were contacted and 13,216 individual beneciaries were
identied, with 3,136 CCT recipients surveyed as part of the baseline survey.
8The Colombian government contracts with two banks, Banco Agrario and Davivienda, to open and make transfers
into accounts. At the time, Banco Agrario served the largest number of MFA beneciaries, mostly because it had
better coverage in smaller and more remote municipalities. Of the 60 municipalities identied for randomization, 54
were served by Banco Agrario and six by Davivienda. MFA beneciaries have the option of withdrawing the transfers
via an ATM, while Davivienda oered mobile banking services. The LISTA tablet provided information for both
withdrawal types, depending on the account specied by the beneciary.
9The SISBEN is an information system used by the Colombian National Government to determine eligible ben-
eciaries of social programs, such as the M as Familas en Acci on CCT program.
10Upon completion of the LISTA implementation ve months after baseline, a second randomization was performed
for the SMS nudge message treatment. This required a cluster randomization at the mother leader level, in order
to prevent spillover between recipients with the same mother leader from biasing estimates. Only those mother
leaders whose recipients reported receiving the tablet were included in the randomization. Randomization blocks
were constructed according to the average number of MFA beneciaries per leader in order to ensure sample size
balance.
83.3 Sample Characteristics
Ninety-one percent of the sample was female, averaging 39 years of age at baseline (SD 10.34 years,
minimum age 18.55, maximum age 83.58). Fifty-one percent lived in rural areas, which was higher
than the national average of 24 percent. Nearly 10 percent of the sample considered themselves
indigenous, over double the 4 percent national average. These characteristics reected the govern-
ment's goal of targeting Colombia's most vulnerable communities. However, the proportion of the
population living in rural areas varied by department and region. Forty percent of the Caribbean
and 75 percent of the Pacic regions were rural. Sixty-eight percent of the total sample lived in
the Caribbean, with 32 percent from the Pacic.
Sampled households averaged ve members, with two younger than 18 and less than one (0.4)
considered a senior citizen. Over half of the beneciaries practiced Catholicism; 19 percent were
married, while 58 percent co-habitated or lived in free union; 54 percent owned their home; and
53 percent lived in houses with cement or gravel oors. Overall, 46 percent had primary education
and 41 percent reached secondary schooling. The average number of people working per household
(either formally or informally) was 1.4. In 14 percent of the households, nobody worked or received
monetary remuneration for labor activities in a designated period of time prior to the baseline
survey, though this may have been due to the cyclical nature of remunerated work in rural areas.
Reported expenditures were relatively homogeneous, with spending increasing less than proportion-
ally with each additional household member. Most of the sample households (87 percent) spent
weekly between 50,000 and 150,000 Colombian pesos (COP) or approximately US$ 2.55 to US$
7.65 per day.
4 Empirical Strategy
This section describes our estimation approach. We start with a discussion of the empirical spec-
ications estimated. We then describe the data used and the balance between the treatment and
control sample prior to the program. Finally, we discuss attrition.
4.1 Estimation Approach
This paper evaluates the short-, medium-, and long-term impact of the LISTA tablet intervention
on nancial attitudes, knowledge, practices, performance, and psychosocial indicators. The cluster
randomized controlled trial we designed allows us to estimate these eects, comparing the outcomes
of interest between MFA beneciaries in tablet treatment versus control municipalities.11
Our analysis presents intention-to-treat (ITT) impacts, that is, comparison of the means of those
assigned to receive LISTA with those in the control group. In other words, all beneciaries living in
municipalities randomly assigned to the treatment group are considered as treated, independently
of whether they actually received the tablet. Based on self-reported and telemetric data, 77.5
11For the SMS treatment, the evaluation compared LISTA tablet beneciaries who received SMS messages vs.
LISTA tablet beneciaries who did not.
9percent of people surveyed reported receiving the LISTA tablet. We also compared the people who
eectively received LISTA to the control group by instrumenting actual use of the tablets with a
dummy indicating whether or not the beneciary was randomized into the treatment group.12
We focus on the ITT analysis to avoid issues that could arise from possible self-selection eects
within the treatment group. An additional advantage of this more conservative approach is we can
interpret the experimental intervention as a policy, in the sense that we estimate impact for targeted
beneciaries of the program and not just those who used the LISTA tablet. For the remainder of
this article, the term \the impact of LISTA "" refers to the ITT estimation.
The core regression framework used for the estimation was:
Yim=0+1Tim+xXi+i (1)
Where1measures the impact of LISTA, and Yimis the outcome variable of interest for individual
iin municipality m. Whether a beneciary was assigned to receive a tablet is determined by Tim.
Ximis a set of characteristics of the respondents at the baseline and includes both demographic
and outcome variables. When available, we condition on the baseline level of the outcome variable
to improve statistical power (McKenzie, 2012; McConnell and Vera-Hern andez, 2015). Finally, i
is the error term. To compute standard errors, we cluster the residuals at the municipality level.13
4.2 Data
Data included four survey rounds plus administrative data from the government, two banks, and
credit records.14Baseline data were collected after the randomization and sample denition, but
prior to the intervention. These data were used to check for balance and as control variables
in subsequent analysis. A specialized survey rm working under the research team's supervision
conducted a phone survey baseline in late April and early May 2015.
Data for the rst follow-up survey were gathered after the LISTA implementation and enabled
a short-term measurement of impact ve months after baseline, just following the end of the tablet
intervention (see Appendix C). The rst follow-up data collection was performed via the Prosperidad
Social call center, under the research team's guidance and supervision in late September and early
October 2015. The second follow-up survey data were collected in person by the same survey rm
7 months after the tablet treatment ended, in April and May 2016 and also under the research
team's supervision. A third follow-up survey was conducted over the phone 25 months after the
intervention ended. The same rm as that which conducted the baseline and second follow-up
12This Treatment-on-the-Treated (ToT) analysis provided similar results to the ITT ndings, though with slightly
higher magnitudes, as expected. Results are available in section 6 of the Supplemental Materials document.
13We measured the impact of SMS messages by comparing SMS recipients vs. tablet-only recipients. To estimate
the eect of the SMS treatment in the second and third follow-ups, we control for the baseline and rst follow-up,
since the SMS intervention began after the rst follow-up. We added a dummy variable dim, to account for missing
data from the rst follow-up survey (equal to 1 for missing values and 0 otherwise), thus dummying out the missing
data and preserving the full sample found at the second and third follow-ups.
14These data were obtained via agreements with the Department of Social Prosperity and, later, the Central Bank
of Colombia, who granted data access while co-author Lina Cardona worked in the latter entity.
10survey collected the data under the research team's supervision in November 2017.
Survey data were complemented with administrative and demographic data provided by Pros-
peridad Social (e.g. the SISBEN points and household composition). Prosperidad Social also
facilitated access to anonymous bank data through December 2015. Finally, the Colombian nan-
cial superintendency enabled access to credit system data through December 2017. Measurement
focused on ve classes of outcomes: nancial attitudes, nancial knowledge, nancial practices,
nancial performance, and psychosocial indicators.
To measure the eect of the tablet on nancial performance, we use two dierent sources of
administrative information. First, we estimate the eect of the tablet intervention on formal savings
and transactionality or frequency of use of formal nancial services using bank administrative data
(from May to December 2015) following an ANCOVA specication for each two-month moving
average. Due to data privacy laws in Colombia, we were unable to match survey data with the
bank administrative data. We standardized average savings using the mean and variance from
January 2014 data. Controls for this estimation include having an account with Banco Agrario
(vs. Davivienda), two-month average monthly savings between January 2014 and April 2015,
the number of nancial institutions in the municipal district, randomization blocks, and a set of
municipal-level socioeconomic covariates.
We estimate the impact of LISTA on credit and debt following the regression specication in
equation (1), using credit system data between the third quarter of 2015 until the end of 2017.
While the bank data was anonymous and we were not able to match the individual observations
with our survey data, we were able to match individual observations with credit records from the
Central Bank of Colombia. Credit records data contain indicators about the type of consumer
credit (i.e., whether it is a standard loan or a credit card), the institution that provided the credit,
outstanding debt amount, the number of default days, among others. Between 2004 and 2017, 10
percent of the sample were found at least once in the dataset, i.e., having at least one credit.
4.3 Treatment-Control Balance
The baseline survey collected data over the phone for 3,136 individuals, 1,567 of which were in the
treatment. For the rst follow-up, a sub-sample of 2,526 beneciaries was administered the survey
over the phone, with 1,267 in the treatment. For the second follow-up, 2,327 people were surveyed
in person, with 1,172 in the treatment. Finally, for the third follow-up, 2,202 people were surveyed
over the phone, with 1,096 in the treatment.
Table 2 compares the control and treatment groups on a subset of baseline measures. Respon-
dents in both groups were statistically identical in terms of household characteristics, savings, MFA,
and ATM practices. Only one of 36 demographic and outcome variables measured at baseline was
signicant.

134.4 Attrition
For the rst follow-up survey, 81 percent of the baseline respondents were successfully re-interviewed.
Response rates for the second and third follow-ups were 74 and 70 percent of baseline respondents,
respectively. This attrition was due in large part to budget constraints which prevented survey-
ing the entire sample at each follow-up, allowing for data collection of 2,500 subjects for the rst
follow-up and 2,300 for the second follow-up. An attempt was made to reach 2,500 subjects for
the third follow-up but due mostly to disconnected cellular numbers, 2,202 surveys were completed
for the third follow-up. It is important to note that 2,983 people (95 percent of the sample) were
surveyed at least once after baseline, as part of the rst, second or third follow-up surveys.
To assess the possible impact of sample attrition, a balance analysis was performed for each
survey round. We estimate the probability of attrition as a function of a treatment dummy and
a range of respondent and household characteristics, controlling for randomization blocks. Results
indicate no signicant dierence between attrition levels in the control and treatment groups.
Some covariate controls did correlate at dierent moments with the probability of attrition in
the rst, second and third follow-up surveys. At separate points, the probability of attrition was
negatively correlated with age, years of schooling, whether the beneciary belongs to an urban
district, and whether the beneciary receives money via account deposits. Having an account with
Banco Agrario , which had a greater ratio of clients in rural areas, was also positively related to
attrition status. In other words, younger, rural, and less educated individuals were harder to reach
in general in the follow-up surveys, regardless of whether they were conducted over the phone or
in person. In sum, the analysis suggests that treatment was not related to attrition status. Some
variables, in particular, years of schooling, area (urban or rural) and type of bank account (deposit
or wire transfer), may be correlated with respondent attrition. Yet the eect of this attrition on
results is marginal at most. The analysis presented in this section considers attrition between
the baseline and the rst, second, and third follow-ups, with only 5 percent of the sample not
re-interviewed at all in the follow-up surveys. Also, the coecients and signicances detected in
estimations with and without control are highly similar, suggesting that the attrition eect (if
present) does not represent a major threat to the validity of results. Regardless, we present results
for the intervention with controls for those characteristics. (See section 5 of the Supplemental
Material for estimates without controls.)

155 Results
This section reports the main results.15The tablet telemetric data suggesst that an average user
engaged with the application for three to four hours, though this does not account for the possibility
that there were multiple users in the same beneciary household.16Following presentation of the
main results in this section, we will examine heterogeneous eects and their links to possible
mechanisms in order to understand how impacts were achieved despite what appears as a low
intensity of treatment compared to traditional nancial education programs.
We also test various individual hypotheses based on the unadjusted marginal p-values. This
implies a potentially large probability that some of the true null hypotheses will be rejected. Fol-
lowing Romano and Wolf (2005), we use a stepwise multiple-testing procedure that asymptotically
controls for the family-wise error rate. Most of the eects for the rst follow-up survive this cor-
rection for multiple-hypothesis testing and remain signicant. For the second and third follow-up,
the results that hold after adjusting for the family-wise error rate are mostly related to nancial
knowledge, attitudes, and savings outcomes.
5.1 Financial Knowledge and Attitudes
Financial knowledge refers to acquisition of basic nancial concepts and information about the CCT
program. Financial attitudes relate to perceptions of the banking sector as well as intertemporal
preferences for having money in cash or in a bank and for having money today or in the future.
Results are reported as standardized eects in Tables 3 and 4.
Financial knowledge. To assess the impact of LISTA on basic nancial concepts, a \true or
false"" test was administered in the three follow-up surveys. It included three sections: savings,
budgeting, and debt. Questions were based on the tablet curriculum although the tablet content
focused less on debt. For the second and third follow-up, additional questions were included, with a
new section for basic numeracy administered in-person for the second follow-up. The rst follow-up
test included 10 questions, while the second and third follow-up surveys had 14 and 11, respec-
tively. Our rst measure of nancial knowledge is based on seven questions that were comparable
between all of the surveys, with each correct answer accounting for one point on the total score (0
to 7). The extended measure included four additional questions, comparable between the second
and third follow-up (0 to 11).
The tablet content focused specically on savings and budgeting with light mention of debt
15Results for the evaluation's SMS intervention are available in section 8 of the Supplemental Materials document.
SMS messages had a positive medium-term impact on the acquisition of nancial knowledge, due to increased un-
derstanding of savings, but limited eects in other areas. Over the longer-term, SMS recipients were less likely to
save - and saved less - in a bank account compared to the tablet-only treatment group. While the reported informal
savings when compared to the tablet-only treatment had a positive coecient, it was not signicant and it is dicult
to conclude that the SMS treatment encouraged substitution between formal and informal savings. Given this, we
report detailed results on the pooled treatment versus control in this paper.
16While it was straightforward to cross-reference tablet registrants with the survey database, it was not possible
to determine which unmatched registrants were members of the beneciary households.
16management only in relation to the previous two topics. Regardless, questions on debt (and nu-
meracy for the second follow-up) were included to explore the possibility of ancillary learning.
LISTA had a positive and signicant short-, medium-, and long-term impact on the composite
scores (Table 3). Overall scores for the treatment group were 0.20 standard deviations (sd) higher
immediately following the intervention, 0.18 sd higher seven months after the intervention, and 0.14
sd higher 25 months after the intervention compared to the control group for the basic test. Scores
for the expanded test were 0.19 and 0.17 sd higher after treatment in the medium- and long-term,
respectively.
Analysis revealed positive and signicant short-, medium-, and long- term impact on savings
and budget knowledge. For the reduced test, there was a positive short-, medium-, and long-term
impact of 0.23, 0.15, and 0.13 sd for savings, respectively. For budget knowledge, the increases were
0.14, 0.08, and 0.14 sd, respectively. Results for the extended version of the test were even more
robust, with medium- and long-term savings knowledge impacts of 0.16 and 0.14 sd and budget
knowledge increases of 0.16 and 0.18 sd. Interestingly, while the savings knowledge impacts waned,
the budget knowledge impacts appear to have strengthened over time. The latter may reect the
building of knowledge via practice.
Results for the reduced debt section lacked signicance in the short-term, reached signicance
in the medium-term with 0.08 sd, and lost signicance in the long-term. For the expanded debt
knowledge section, results were not signicant for the medium- or the long-term. As we will see,
this may align with dierences in uses of formal credit between the control and treatment groups
25 months after completing the intervention.
There was some indication of marginal impact on numeracy skills in the second follow-up survey,
suggesting that practice may have increased acquisition of certain types of knowledge and skills,
since LISTA did not directly address mathematical concepts. In other words, people who begin
to manage their accounts may need to use more basic math, which in turn may have increased
their performance on the basic numeracy questions. As will be seen below, results from rural areas
appear to have driven this improvement. Unfortunately, given budget constraints an in-person
survey could not be conducted for the third follow-up so long-term numeracy was not examined.
Financial Attitudes. The survey asked respondents to rate their trust and comfort with banks
on a 1 to 4 scale. The treatment group increased the levels of trust by around 0.20 sd both in the
short- and medium-term, but this eect dissipated in the long-term. Similarly, there is a positive
short-term eect on comfort with banks with a shift of 0.19 sd. While this eect is not signicant
in the medium-term, a marginal increase in comfort with banks is found in the long-term, though it
was not robust to the multiple-hypothesis correction. In other words, right after the intervention,
the treated beneciaries reported feeling more comfortable going to banks, but after a few months
the eect dissipated. One hypothesis is that the intervention succeeded in changing attitudes to-
ward visiting a bank, but after additional experience testing this new perception, the beneciary
may have updated her attitude, returning to the level of comfort prior to the intervention.

19Historically, many MFA beneciaries believed they were not allowed to leave any money in
MFA bank accounts because it would be \sent back"" to the government. This caused a practice
of withdrawing all funds from their accounts following the transfer. While this was true early on
in the MFA program, the practice or returning funds was eliminated several years earlier. In one
of the LISTA modules, the beneciaries are taught that balances left in the MFA bank accounts
are safe following their MFA transfer. Results indicate that the probability of believing they can
leave money in their MFA account increased signicantly for the treatment compared to the control
group in the short-term, while decreasing in magnitude, with signicance in the medium- and no
signicance in the long-term following the multiple-hypothesis correction.
Intertemporal Preferences. Respondents were asked whether they preferred 80 thousand COP
in cash compared to 80, 90 or 100 thousand COP in a bank (and vice versa). Based on these
responses, we constructed a bank over cash preference scale that goes from 1 (always cash taker)
to 6 (always bank taker). Similarly, individuals were asked to choose between 80 thousand COP
today or receiving successively higher amounts in one month in order to construct an intertemporal
preference scale, which ranks from lower to higher patience.
A signicant impact is found for intertemporal preferences and preferences for money in a bank
over cash (Table 4). Signicant medium-term and long-term intertemporal preferences were -0.17
sd and -0.09 sd, indicating greater patience. This suggests that beneciaries may have accumu-
lated more savings or felt more condent about their ability to manage cash ows and expenses.
Meanwhile, preferences for money in bank over cash strengthened over the short-, medium-, and
long-term, with 0.16, 0.18, and 0.19 sd changes, respectively. These preference shifts may be linked
to, and become vital for, changing nancial habits and preferences in the future. Overall, treated
beneciaries were less likely to prefer money today or to need it on hand immediately, implying
that they were more patient or had fewer liquidity constraints. This result likewise suggests that
acquisition of basic nancial knowledge and positive changes in attitudes towards banks may lead
to changes in behavior.
In sum, LISTA had an impact on basic nancial knowledge, attitudes, and preferences. Next,
we examine whether these shifts translated into practice adoption.
5.2 Financial Practices
As found in previous nancial education evaluations, knowledge and attitudes may change, but this
need not imply the adoption of new nancial practices. We analyzed whether the program had an
eect on concrete nancial practices adoption such as CCT withdrawals, ATM use, savings habits,
budgeting, and technology use.17Tables 5 to 7 report these results.
17A section of questions related to technology use was introduced at the second follow-up survey. As expected,
use of tablets over the previous six months was signicantly higher in the treatment group. But interestingly, the
probability of use of other forms of technology in particular, use of Facebook, WhatsApp, video applications on the
cellphone also increased after intervention, indicating that the intervention may have helped to reduce barriers to
technology use. See the Supplemental Material document for results.
20MFA practices. As discussed above, LISTA sought to eliminate myths about the MFA pro-
gram and encourage new withdrawal practices ensuring the female beneciary's control over the
transfer. A major issue is how the beneciary withdraws the transfer and whether she leaves funds
in the account for safekeeping or withdraws it all, either submitting to the temptation to spend
it or increasing the likelihood of others accessing the funds. In the medium-term, the program
had a positive eect on the probability of leaving money in the MFA account, while a long-term
eect was found on whether the beneciary was the person who withdrew the cash transfer. This
indicates that treated beneciaries not only changed beliefs about whether money could be left in
their accounts (as seen in the \Financial Attitudes"" section), but they put that belief into practice
and started leaving money in their MFA accounts, a nding conrmed below with the bank admin-
istrative data. Nevertheless, the dierence in leaving money in the MFA account appears to have
disappeared in the long-term, based on self-report.
More people in the treatment also withdrew money while accompanied with another person, but
in the medium- and long-term this eect disappeared. This short-term nding was unexpected. The
assumption was that the tablet content would foster more individual and independent withdrawals.
The program encouraged users to not share their cards nor their pin passwords because they were
unable to use or felt uncomfortable engaging with an ATM. In the medium-term, questions were
added to understand the shift. A hypothesis for why more women in the treatment group went
with others to the ATM is discussed below.
ATM use. A range of questions explored ATM practices. No impact was detected for induc-
ing members of the treatment group to use ATMs as their withdrawal channel, nor were there
dierences for sharing their card with others. This may be due to external constraints related to
ATM access. Short-term outcomes indicate that the ATM simulator may have increased the prob-
ability of feeling capable of teaching someone to use the ATM, given the unexpected increase in the
number of people in the treatment group who accompanied someone to withdraw their transfers
from the ATM. To examine whether the ATM gamication-based learning module was put into
practice, we further asked at the second and third follow-ups if those who felt capable of teaching
others had actually taught someone in the previous six months. We found a signicant increase
in the medium-term, with the treatment reporting teaching their friends, neighbors, or strangers
to use the ATM. Yet no eect was found in the long-term. Beyond CCT, ATM, and technology
practices, we also examined budgeting and savings habits.
Budgeting habits. In the short- and medium-term, a marginally signicant impact was found
in whether the beneciaries (91 percent female) were those responsible for managing household -
nances. Yet no eect was found relating to the probability of a treated beneciary keeping written
track of the household accounts.

22Budgeting and saving. The survey included two multiple response questions regarding bud-
geting and savings practices in the face of hypothetical situations. Respondents were asked what
they would do in the case of an emergency when they needed a certain amount of money. Over 17
percent of the treatment chose \using savings"" in the short-term, nearly doubling that of control,
while in the medium-term more than double selected \using saving"" (Table 6). Interestingly, a
statistically signicant substitution appeared between those who opted to pawn something versus
those who would look for a job, with the treatment preferring the former over the latter. Despite
the multiple choices given, the results suggest a substitution with the \using loan"" option. Similar
results with slightly smaller magnitudes were found for the long-term.
When asked what they would do with a similar windfall, no impact in distribution was found,
suggesting that although the treatment group may be saving more, enabling them to buer against
external shocks (a nding also found with the stated of savings goals), this does not necessarily
mean that treatment members generated such a large surplus that they perceived greater utility
(compared to control) in saving the hypothetical windfall. The three most popular options for both
treatment and control were invest in a business, followed by savings and home investment. These
hypothetical questions call for deeper understanding of savings goals and habits.
Finally, there is evidence of better expense management. In the medium-term, a marginal eect
that failed to survive the multiple-hypothesis correction was detected on the self-reported ability
to cover expenses over the past six months. Yet these results strengthened in the long-term, with
7.5 percentage points more in the treatment claiming they could cover their expenses, amount-
ing to a statistically signicant 21 percent increase, robust to the multiple-hypothesis correction.
This evidence is further supported by the fact that no signicant dierences were found for weekly
household expenditures. In other words, our data suggest that the intervention did not increase
household expenditures (a proxy for increased cash ow) but did promote better saving habits (as
seen in the next sections) and, thus, improved budget management.
Saving habits. The LISTA intervention emphasized the importance of setting a savings goal,
and results suggest that the treatment had a positive and signicant impact (Table 4). In the
short-term, the probability of having a saving goal was around 17 percentage points higher com-
pared to the control group mean, representing a 45 percent increase. This signicant eect remained
in the medium- and long-term, with 9 and 15 percentage point dierences, which translate into
33 and 53 percent increases, respectively. The data also suggest that the intervention improved
the probability of setting a saving goal for emergencies among the LISTA recipients, while LISTA
beneciaries were less likely to specify household and business improvement savings objectives.
To further test the impact of LISTA on savings habits, the survey asked whether beneciaries
saved money and where they saved it (see Panel A of Table 7). More people in the treatment group
reported saving ( both formally and informally), yet this impact was only signicant in the short-
term. The same result appeared when analyzing if people saved at all formally, with short-term
impact yet with no medium- or long-term eect. There is a marginally signicant improvement in
23formal savings in the long-term, driven by more savings in cooperatives compared to the control
group. This is evident when disaggregating the formal savings; even though saving in groups and
cooperatives was signicant in the medium-term, the largest component of these savings channels
(in a bank) was signicant only in the short-term.
Impact on informal savings habits were present across all three follow-ups. In the short-term,
LISTA boosted the percentage of people saving informally by 15 percentage points, a growth of
26 percent over control. The impact persisted in the medium-term and long-term, with 11 and 10
percentage points more saving informally compared to control, a 32 percent and 26 percent increase,
respectively. In other words, treated users reported that they were more likely to save, particularly
at home (informal savings). There is some indication that users could be substituting the initial
attempt to save formally in the short-term with informal savings in the medium- and long-term,
given the disappearance of formal savings habits between the short- and medium-term combined
with maintenance of the percentage growth of informal savers in the medium- and long-term. The
treatment group is thus not losing the savings habit spurred by the intervention, as seen in the
maintenance of a savings goal and savings habits across all three follow-ups. Rather, users seem to
opt for informal savings in the medium- and long-term, suggesting the possible existence of formal
savings barriers.
Taken together, the loss of comfort in the banks, external constraints related to ATM access,
and the shift from formal to informal savings habits, all raise questions about supply-side barriers
to formal savings given the persistence of informal savings habits. Despite evidence of increases in
knowledge and expressed trust in the nancial entity, if the product is too costly or poorly designed,
adoption will suer. Evidence on nancial performance further supports this assertion.
5.3 Financial Performance
Self-reported savings. For the self-reported savings data, the impact of the intervention on the
aggregate amount of money saved formally and informally is signicant for the short-, medium-,
and long-term in the Tobit estimation (see Panel B of Table 7). But this was not the case for the
total amount of self-reported formal savings, in which only a short-term impact was detected. This
nding aligns with the shift in self-reported formal savings habits between the short- and medium-
term. Interestingly, Tobit estimates of self-reported bank savings and OLS estimates using the
bank administrative data are both around 17,000 Colombian pesos. In other words, at both the
extensive and intensive margins, LISTA appears to have had less of an impact on saving in formal
nancial institutions over time, compared to informal savings. Unfortunately, we lack access to the
medium- and long-term bank data to further conrm this hypothesis.
Bank savings and transactionality. Bank administrative data corroborate the self-reported
short-term impact on formal savings (see Table 9). The treatment group had higher average sav-
ings in the partner banks in the months following the start of the intervention up until three months
after it ended, or until December 2015, the last date the bank data were available.

27Analysis of the administrative data did not indicate overall increased transactionality with the
bank, e.g., more use of debit, credit, withdrawals, or deposits. In fact, the coecient for a composite
measure of transactionality was negative for the treatment, suggesting that users overall interacted
less with their bank account. The analysis of heterogeneous eects suggest that this is the result
of statistically signicant less transactionality in the Caribbean. It should also be noted that for
MFA accounts, fees were charged for transactions after surpassing a minimal threshold of use.
Credit. At end of 2017, when the third follow-up was administered, the credit system data
indicated a marginally signicant 19 percent decrease in the proportion of the treatment group
that had taken out a formal loan since the start of the intervention (Table 10). Much of this impact
appears to have occurred between 2015 and 2016, when there was a signicant 25 percent decrease
in whether the treatment had taken a formal loan.
More robust ndings emerge when the sample is examined only for the 91 percent of women in
the sample. For them, the impact strengthened over time, with women systematically taking out
less credit, with a marginally signicant decrease of 23 percent in 2015 and 2016 and a signicant
decrease of 26 percent between 2015 and 2017. It appears that this is driven mostly by a statistically
signicant reduction in credit card use. Finally, it should be noted that all people in the sample
received the CCT benet. Previous evidence on this population has identied a positive eect in
the extensive margin of credit (a 15 percent increase) for MFA program beneciaries (Cardona
et al., 2017). It is reasonable to hypothesize that the LISTA intervention decreased formal credit
use on top of the positive impact created by participation in the CCT program.
Spending. Self-reported weekly savings data were collected at the baseline and third follow-
up, with detailed six-month, monthly, and weekly spending data collected for the second follow-up.
No spending dierences were detected, although signicant savings impacts were found. A possible
explanation is that the intervention may have impacted income; unfortunately, we could not collect
data for this variable.
Regardless, evidence indicates that even with an eective demand-side intervention targeting
nancial literacy and capability, it is important to take into account supply-side constraints asso-
ciated with access, products, and services. Financial inclusion is not equivalent to nancial health.
Taken together, these ndings - more informal savings, less use of formal credit, specied savings
goals focused on emergencies, and reported ease of meeting household expenses though without a
rise in household expenditures - all paint an emerging picture of increased nancial health for the
treatment households (CSFI, 2017).
5.4 Psychosocial Indicators
Given impact found at the rst follow-up, the second and third follow-ups attempted light measures
of participant attitudes towards themselves, their life, and others. Results indicate that LISTA had
varying impact on these outcomes given the measures used (Table 11).

average value of 2014. The control means column shows non-standardized values. The dependent variable of credit refer to persons either having a credit card or a consumption credit itself. Similarly,
total debt includes consumption debt and credit card debt.
30Optimism and pessimism. Respondents were asked to use a Likert scale of one to seven to
grade themselves on an optimism and pessimism continuum (Kemper et al., 2011). A statistically
signicant impact was detected in the medium-term - being part of the treatment group increased
the level of optimism and decreased the level of pessimism among beneciaries.18Yet this eect
disappeared over the long-term.
Trust. Another set of questions, which borrowed one item and adapted another from the World
Values Survey, asked beneciaries if they trusted other people and how much they trusted them.
Although there was no statistical dierence between the control and treatment groups in trusting
others in general, LISTA may have improved marginally the level of trust the treated beneciaries
felt towards others in their community over the medium-term. This could be a result of the rota-
tion methodology implemented during the treatment. Specically, social interaction between the
MFA mother leader and her group members as a result of the tablet rotations may have generated
enough social capital to increase levels of trust between people in the same community. Yet in the
long-term, no dierences were found.
While some results indicate a general shift in orientation over the medium-turn, they are more
suggestive than denitive. The primary goal of the evaluation was to measure nancial knowledge,
practices, and performance impacts, and inadequate attention was paid to the eects of the female
empowerment messaging.
6 Potential Mechanisms
Results indicate that a digital-based tool which incorporates simplied, actionable, concrete, tar-
geted, and engaging content can be eective when combined with a community-based distribution
methodology. But who did the intervention work best for and why? An examination of the het-
erogeneous eects helps specify mechanisms for further exploration.
6.1 Heterogeneous Treatment Eects
To identify initial insights into how the intervention generated impact, we explored heterogeneous
eects by interacting the treatment with a series of socio-demographic variables: urban/rural, edu-
cation (primary/secondary), poverty (quartiles), age (quartiles), and region (Caribbean/Pacic). In
general, the more rural, less educated, poorer, and younger the individual, the greater the impact.
This suggests that the intervention was eective in providing important information to households
with relatively greater consumption smoothing and income shock challenges.
18Evidence suggests that optimism and pessimism may be two constructs. Less optimism, for example, does not
imply necessarily that someone is more pessimistic and vice versa (Herzberg et al., 2006)

32Financial Knowledge and Attitudes. Overall, the broad and lasting eects of knowledge gains
and savings goals suggest that the content was clear, easy to understand, and memorable. Yet
there were dierences. We consistently nd at all follow-ups more gains among the rural and
primary educated compared to the urban and secondary educated populations (Tables 21-26 in
the Supplementary Material document). This was the case for savings and budget knowledge.
The sample in the Pacic region, which is 75 percent rural, experienced larger gains in savings
knowledge. In the long-term, savings knowledge improvements were greatest among the sample's
middle income segments. Furthermore, those with greatest gains were the youngest quartile or
those between the ages of 18 and 32 years.
With respect to attitudes (Tables 27-32 in the Supplementary Material), the relationship to the
MFA account were similar across dierent groups. Yet, regarding attitudes towards banks and in
contrast to the Caribbean, the Pacic region reported less trust and comfort with banks as well as
a higher preference for cash in hand vs. having it in the bank. In the medium- and long-term, only
people in the Caribbean reported more trust in the banks, while people in the Pacic region re-
ported negative trust in the long-term. More trust and comfort was also registered among those in
rural areas and with secondary education. Regarding intertemporal preferences, primary educated
individuals reported preferring cash vs. banks while the youngest group exhibited more patience
compared to the control.
Financial Practices. People across all segments reported similar gains in having a savings goals
(Tables 33-38 in the Supplementary Material). As for budgeting practices, for the short- and
medium-term people in rural areas reported more being able to manage their nances, an improve-
ment also observed in the long-term for those living in the Caribbean. In the same region and in
urban areas, people reported higher probabilities of leaving money in their accounts. The lack of
this nding among those in the Pacic and rural areas aligns with the less trust in banks reported
in the previous section, suggesting the possible existence of supply-side constraints.
More people in rural areas report feeling capable of teaching someone how to use an ATM,
having also taught or accompanied someone to do so. This is also the case for those in the Pacic,
a region with a large share of rural population. By level of education, while the primary educated
report having been accompanied to an ATM, those with secondary education reported having
taught someone how to use one, a skill also reported more by the youngest people in the study.
This suggests the possible existence of a social mechanism with the secondary educated and younger
people teaching the primary educated and older population how to use an ATM.
In the long-term, the only eects that remained were for people being able to manage their
nances in the Caribbean region, and poorer people having an MFA card and having withdrawn
their last MFA transfer themselves.
Financial Performance. As mentioned earlier, similar impacts on savings and budgeting knowl-
edge and the setting of savings goals were found across groups (Tables 45-50 in the Supplementary
33Material). These results align with eects on whether people save informally, which were found
across all groups and survey waves. On the one hand, it appears that in the long-term there was
more impact on informal savings among the rural, less educated, and poorest population, which
aligns with results for knowledge and practices. On the other hand, the rural, Caribbean, and bet-
ter educated reported greater use of formal savings, while no impact was found for amount saved.
In terms of age eects, larger savings magnitudes were seen among the older population groups.
The primary educated reported greater impact in the ability to cover recent household expenses in
the medium-term, with the eect strengthening in the long-term.
We were able to examine eects of region using the bank administrative data (Table 51 in the
Supplementary Material). The results tell two stories and help to make sense of the dierential
impacts seen in the regions. In the Caribbean, users decreased their transactionality with the
MFA bank and saved more by leaving more money in their account. Both categories of variables
were signicant across several months. In the Pacic region, however, transactionality increased
signicantly as did access to credit, while savings impacts were null. Given the nature of the MFA
account, greater transactionality also implies more fees. This may have helped lead over time to
less trust in banks in the Pacic region19. In other words, initial steps toward nancial inclusion
may have occurred in the respective regions, with one taking a savings/low transactionality and
the other a credit/high transactionality pathway.
Results once again indicate that in general the poorer, less educated, and the more rural the
population, the stronger the impact on informal and overall savings. Furthermore, there are corre-
lations in the sample between poverty, rural residence, educational level, age, and region.
6.2 Discussion
The patterns of heterogeneous eects lead us to hypothesize four mechanisms that may have rein-
forced one another to improve nancial knowledge, attitudes, practices, and performance, with a
fth mechanism hindering formal nancial inclusion: (i) simple, focused, and memorable content,
(ii) social learning within the household, (iii) channel, (iv) social learning within the community,
and (v) barriers to formal nancial system access. Mechanisms ii, iii, and iv highlight the impor-
tance of leveraging a social component with digital interventions.
Content. The tablet content consisted of simple, focused, well-crafted messages communicated via
testimonial videos and stories that sought to build an emotional identication and connection with
the largely female audience. Certain components such as learning how to use the ATM and the im-
portance of savings, were also communicated via gamication. Messages sought to be actionable in
the areas of MFA practices, ATM withdrawals, savings, and budgeting. The impact detected across
groups for nancial knowledge, attitudes, and practice adoption suggest that these messages were
19We were not able to use administrative data to analyze heterogeneous eects of other socio-demographic variables
for formal savings since the individual data was anonymous below the cluster or municipal level. We analyzed
heterogeneous eects with the credit administrative data, but we did not nd any dierential eect of the intervention
on credit outcomes that survived the multiple hypothesis test correction
34socialized and internalized. While the SMS messages may have increased knowledge and savings at
the intensive margins, the bulk of the impact was generated by having access to the tablet20. What
remains unknown is which content in the LISTA app worked best individually or together and why.
Social learning within the household. One reason Fundaci on Capital selected the tablet
rotation methodology was because it allowed users to bring the tablet into their homes. The pro-
gram conrmed reaching 100,000 registered CCT users, yet at the end of the program over 160,000
individuals had registered on the tablets, as it was common for family members and friends to create
their own proles. Qualitative interviews likewise suggest the tablets were a novelty when brought
into the home and it was common for mothers to share them with partners, children, and other
household members, thus generating conversations within the family, which may have continued
after the tablet passed to the next user. An open question is how much the family-centered nature
of this learning reinforced knowledge acquisition, practice adoption, and improved performance
after the intervention.
Channel. The use of the mother leader as a near-peer who brought the tablet to the end-users
appears as a third mechanism. This might have driven impact in two ways. First, trust in the
mother leader may have increased adoption and openness to the messaging. This is supported by
qualitative interviews during the pilot phase and the process evaluation, and, more importantly,
with detection of a positive and statistically signicant link between quality of the relationship
with the mother leader and beneciary outcomes, as reported by the user during the second in-
person follow-up. We hypothesize that (a) the closeness of the relationship with the mother leader
increases not only the likelihood of receiving the tablet, but the amount of time spent on it, and
(b) the time of use or intensity further predicts outcomes.
Social learning within the community. Another channel of impact involves the network of
(mostly female) beneciaries, with whom the mother leader often communicates en masse via mobile
phone or by convening meetings. The process evaluation revealed that it was common for mother
leaders to conduct trainings by inviting mothers to her home or another space where they trained
as a group and discussed content. As with the social learning generated within the household,
knowledge and attitude acquisition may have continued afterward within peer networks (mothers
and households), especially as tablets rotated among beneciaries within the municipality over sev-
eral months. The aforementioned results on ATM accompaniment withdrawal practices and the
teaching of ATM may reect such a social learning component at work.
Barriers to formal nancial system access. As can be inferred from the main results and
20See section 8 of the Supplemental Document for SMS results. Respondents were also asked during the in-person
second follow-up survey about use of the LISTA Kit, including the calendar and stickers which reiterated the tablet
messaging. In most cases these materials were not actively used and, instead, were stored in non-visible places as
observed during the in-person second follow-up.
35heterogeneous eects, the major barrier to formal savings and deeper nancial inclusion across
product types does not appear to be an issue of trust alone. In the short-, medium-, and long-
term, the preference for safekeeping cash in banks maintained statistical signicance. In terms of
practices, over the short-term members of the treatment group expressed an openness to leaving
money in the account and saving in the bank, as evidenced by both self-reported and bank admin-
istrative data. Yet overall this impact was lost in the medium-term, with marginal signicance in
the long-term for whether people save formally. The heterogeneity of positive eects concentrated
in the Caribbean, with negative eects in the Pacic. Furthermore, the lack of eects in the formal
market among the rural population suggest that geographical access and product design may be
the biggest barriers. While in the Caribbean, transactionality decreased, it increased in the Pacic
according to the short-term bank administrative data. Yet overall in the long-term, use of formal
credit decreased. Even though data are still lacking for testing further hypotheses, the use of less
credit is aligned with the ability to save and manage better their own nances. A structural analysis
of the supply and demand factors at play in this intervention, something that to our knowledge
has not been attempted in the eld of nancial inclusion, may shed light on these unanswered
questions.
In sum, future evaluations could disaggregate these mechanisms, while further structural mod-
eling of the data, which would move beyond the reduced form analysis used here, could add insights
into learning processes.
7 Conclusion
Evaluation results suggest that it is possible to design and deliver an impactful, cost-eective, and
scalable digital-based nancial education program for lower-income CCT recipients. When the
content is presented in a simplied and gamied way, includes relevant and motivating content,
and is aligned with government social protection strategies, nancial knowledge can be improved,
increasing nancial health in the long-term, beneting the poorest women at low cost21.
On average, members of the treatment group created nancial systems, undergirded largely
by savings and budgeting practices, which positively inuenced their spending, saving, borrowing,
and planning. Such outcomes reect increased nancial health (CSFI, 2017). Nevertheless, un-
derstanding how to move from these outcomes to formal nancial inclusion, especially in relation
to saving, credit, and insurance products, requires more analysis. Just as banking alone is not
enough, neither is a demand-side nancial education intervention. To use a popular Marshallian
metaphor, for the scissors to cut, both blades { supply and demand { are needed. Increasing the
nancial inclusion and, by extension, the nancial health of the most vulnerable requires both.
Regardless, this evidence demonstrates that a well-designed digital-based programs that takes into
consideration content, channel, and social learning within and between households could help.
21When massively deployed, the LISTA intervention can create economies of scale, dramatically decreasing cost
per person. Fundaci on Capital calculated that once completed, the LISTA program in Colombia cost US$6-9 per
user, a signicant savings from the US$22 per person of the pilot intervention or the US$40 of in-person training.

The evaluation’s second intervention consisted of sending SMS nudge messages to a selection of
treated beneﬁciaries of the LISTA program. Evidence indicates that text messages augmented in
some areas the e↵ects of the tablet program. There was a positive impact on the acquisition of
ﬁnancial knowledge and self-reported ﬁnancial performance. However, there is a limited e↵ect on
the practice adoption and general attitudes.
No impact is found on ﬁnancial preferences and attitudes. A possible explanation is that the
text message content did not target the CCT recipients’ attitudes towards ﬁnancial institutions,
with only one of the text messages discussing banks (and the message conveyed was that of saving
in formal entities as the safest alternative).
Financial practices. The SMS’s e↵ect on the adoption of ﬁnancial practices appears limited.
There was no e↵ect on saving or budgeting practices, ranging from having a savings goal to keeping
written accounts. However, there may be an impact on MFA-related practices. The SMS treatment
increased the probability of leaving the card with family members and friends. Even if this result
is not ideal from an MFA program perspective (i.e., MFA cards should be personal and nontrans-
ferable items), it might reﬂect LISTA’s impact on beneﬁciaries teaching someone else to use an
ATM. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that having been part of the SMS treatment group
decreases the probability of being accompanied by someone to use the ATM by 13 percentage points.
Financial performance. Analysis suggests that the SMS intervention had a positive and sig-
niﬁcant e↵ect on self-reported ﬁnancial performance. There is an impact of SMS treatment on
beneﬁciary’s total and informal amount of savings, including savings at home. These results are
consistent with the SMS content, in the sense that most of the messages encourage saving practices.
When considering the ﬁnancial practices and performance results together, there is indication that
the SMS treatment had an e↵ect at the intensive rather than the extensive margins. It appears
to have increased the magnitudes of those who acquired more knowledge and were already saving,
but it did not increase the number of people who saved compared to the tablet-only treatment,
suggesting that what sparked the savings habit was the tablet app itself.
Psychosocial Indicators. No impact was detected impact on the attitudes and preferences
of the treated beneﬁciaries for the SMS intervention. Once again, this may be due in large part
to the content of these messages, which did not target directly these behavioral or empowerment

the beneﬁciary may indirectly increase her sense of self-e cacy and optimism.

 Digital media literacy refers to having the ability to use digital technologies 
to participate in and contribute to social, cultural, political, and economic life. 
It includes understanding the impact of recent technologies on society, 
understanding and ha ving the ability to manage digital identities fittingly, and 
having the ability to find, organize, understand, evaluate, analyze and create 
digital information. While the level of digital media literacy in Jordan is still 
in its infancy, there is a positiv e move towards educating the Jordanian 
people about digital media. Recently the Jordanian government has 
developed a national executive plan for digital media literacy to develop 
community awareness and improve its capabilities in dealing with 
information and media sources during the Corona pandemic through the 
Ministry of Culture, Therefore, in this study, we will review the digital media 
literacy in Jordan and we will study the challenges and development of digital 
media literacy in Jordan.

Introduction  
The concept of media literacy is not new but is definitely important among the researchers in 
the fields of education and the media (Potter, 2010). Several Western educat ional systems 
developed ""media literacy"" as a way to enable citizens to achieve informed interactions with 
media messages (Alhamadani, 2015).  Along with technological advancements came the 
concept of digital media literacy that emerged as a broader and mor e comprehensive

education form than the media literacy itself, although it was not a substitute for the concept. 
It was a concept that needed a broader understanding of basic skills; such as reading, writing, 
understanding and using modern technologies (Pa rk & Burford, 2013). Digital skills have  
now become necessary to equip c ommunity members with basic skills that will enable them 
to solve digital issues in their environment and the world at large.  
 
Digital media literacy refers to having the ability to cr eate and use technologies to participate 
in and contribute to social, cultural, political, and economic life. It includes understanding the 
impact of recent technologies on society, understanding and having the ability to manage 
digital identities fittingl y, and having the ability to find, organize, understand, evaluate, 
analyze and cr eate digital information (Hobbs , 2010). Digital literacy involves critically 
participating in technology and developing social awareness. However, a variety of things 
together  with business agenda and cultural understandings will form how technology is 
employed to convey information (Assal, 2016). Having the ability to speak and represent data 
is entirely different in numerous contexts and to different audiences (for example, i n visual, 
audio, or matter modes). This involves finding and choosing relevant information, critically 
evaluating and re -contextualizing data and is underpinned by an understanding of the cultural 
and social contexts during which this takes place. Digital literacy provides the citizens with 
the flexibility to require advantage of the wealth of recent and rising opportunities related to 
digital technologies while additionally remaining aware of what the different challenges 
technology will give. In short, di gital literacy is the ‘savvyness’ that permits to participate in 
the digital realm meaningfully and safely.  
 
In order for the desired benefit of digital media literacy to be realized, it is necessary to 
possess the skills that constitute the measurement to ols for the effectiveness of digital media 
literacy for individuals.  Digital media literacy skills are extensions of media literacy skills 
where the essence of the vocation and competence are to equip citizens the ability to search 
for the right informatio n and using those information efficiently and positively. Individuals 
need skills to get a good understanding of how to create knowledge, express reality and 
engage in civic activities and social work (Hobbs, 2010).  
 
When measuring media literacy competenc y, conventional definitions included skills of 
access, consumption and focuses on interpreting media messages (Auferheide, 1993; Hobbs 
2001).   Buckingham (2007)  defines several of these constructs, explaining:  
Access... includes the skills and competencies needed to locate media content, 
using the available technologies and associated software. ...Understand includes 
the ability to decode or interpret media, for example, through an awareness of 
formal and generic conventions, design features and  rhetorical devices. It also 
involves knowledge of production processes, and of patterns of ownership and 
institutional control, and an ability to critique media, for example, in terms of the 
accuracy or reliability of their representations of the real wor ld. Finally, create 
involves the ability to use the media to produce and communicate one’s own 
messages, whether for purposes of self -expression or in order to influence or 
interact with others  (p. 44) .  
 
However, with the inclusion of digital media, the s kill of production or creation become 
significant. Media creation/production is the skill enabled by digital media in which the 
people are no longer passive audiences, they are also active content creators. Therefore,

media creation is the main characteris tic that distinguishes digital literacy from media literacy 
(Park, 2012). In 2011, UNESCO concluded that the most common digital literacy abilities are 
awareness, access, evaluation and creation. This statement is agreed by scholars who have 
considered the se skills as measurements of digital media literacy competency (Assal, 2016; 
Fedorove, 2008; Hallaq, 2016).  
 
Jordanians are very much exposed to different types of media. With a population of 10 
million people, there are thirty -eight TV channels, thirty -nine radio stations, and about thirty 
newspapers daily and weekly (Media Commission, 2019). According to the Jordanian 
Department of Statistics (2017), social media usage has reached 93.5%. With this widespread 
media usage particularly online media, the Jor danian audiences are not solely exposed to 
smart data, they are conjointly subjected to the risks of harmful usage and content. This might 
embody violence, extremism, cultural invasion, and incorrect conventional pictures regarding 
status, race, or gender,  additionally to the industrial nature of media messages (Darweesh, 
2006).  
 
The level of digital media literacy in Jordan has been developed in recent years,  there is a 
positive move towards educating the Jordanian people about digital media (Ashdiefat & 
Khasawneh, 2012; Melki, 2015). Jordan Media Institute (JMI) is probably the country’s 
biggest proponent for media literacy. JMI is a freelance media institute  that aims to enhance 
the output of Jordanian media and to promote the name and image of the media profession 
domestically and regionally by establishing medium that helps to circularize the ideas of 
media literacy (JMI, 2018). In this paper , we will revie w the digital media literacy in Jordan 
and we will describe  the challenges and development of digital media literacy in Jordan. In 
section 2 we will explore the history of digital media literacy in Arab world and Jordan. In 
section 3 we will explicate  the challenges of digital media literacy in Jordan. In section 4 we 
will review the recent developments of digital media literacy in Jordan. Finally, in section 5 
we will provide the conclusion and recommendation .    
 
Methodology  
This paper is conceptual in na ture. However the historical analysis provided was done 
through a careful reading of literatures on media literacy in the Arab world generally and in 
Jordan more specifically. This study is also part of the first author’s PhD thesis in which he 
had conduct ed multiple interviews with relevant parties such as media experts and members 
of the Jordan Media Institute (JMI) . Therefore the discussion provided is also based on a 
deliberate input from experts in the area who are very familiar with the media and educ ation 
landscape in Jordan . 
 
History of Digital Media Literacy in The Arab World and Jordan  
The Arab world neglected media literacy for a long time, which led to negative consequences 
that exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic disturbances. Abu-Fadil (2016) 
described the reason for neglecting digital media literacy to the Arab higher education 
systems which have been suffered from the absence of facilities and equipment that require 
digital literacy. Moreover, the individual academic initiati ves that called for media literacy in 
Arab universities have been met with opposition and lack of support from traditional 
academics, while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of Media 
and digital literacy (Melki and Maaliki, 20 16).

Furthermore, media literacy is at the bottom of the list of Arab priorities, as it reflects the 
state of the media itself, which is a tool of power and indicates a lack of respect for the press 
and its lack of prestige, and this is reflected in the degree of credibility, thus it serves the 
interest of the ruling elites (Saleh, 2009).  However, digital media literacy has been included 
in the curricula of a number of Egyptian universities since 2005, in addition to WeChat 
organizing workshops for final year students at the Faculty of Mass Communication at Cairo 
University on media literacy (Tayie, 2016).  In Palestine, the concept of media literacy was a 
new concept at the level of civil society, so efforts were limited to some initiatives, activities 
and projects that have increased since 2009 (Nuseibeh and Abu Arqoub, 2016).  
 
At the begin ning of the new millennium, i nterest in digital media literacy began in Jordan 
through some official Jordanian initiatives to develop digital literacy, such as the Minis try of 
Education training te achers to use computers by  obtaining the International Computer 
Driving License (ICDL) program, as well as the (INTEL Education for the Future program), 
hoping to provide teachers With computer skills and employing them in the e ducational 
process and using them in obtaining media content that affects digital media literacy 
(Olaimat, 2013).  The Ministry of Education, in cooperation with several bodies, including the 
Center for the Protection and Freedom of Journalists, launched th e (Education Through 
Journalism) program, which was considered the first training in media literacy, in which 
schools invest on daily newspapers to teach many educational materials such as history, 
geography, science, reading, civic education, creatio n and  expression to a group of school 
students. The exercises and activities were are carried out inside the classroom at the rate of 
one session per week to enable students to keep pace with the developments of the age and 
the knowledge revolution and to creat e a spirit of dialogue and interaction with various 
community issues. With the aim of training Jordanian youth, providing them with knowledge 
and skills to deal with the media, facing illiteracy in information and communication 
technology, and promoting fr eedom of expression, the Jordanian National Committee for 
Education, Culture and Science, in cooperation with the UNESCO Office in Amman and the 
Arab Women Media Center, implemented an exploratory project entitled (Introducing the 
concept of media literacy  in Jordanian schools ) With funding from the Swedish government 
in 2013 (Assal, 2016).  
 
The United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) and Google, in cooperation with the 
World Bank Institute, held a training workshop in 2013 entitled Digital Tools f or News 
Gathering and Cross -Cultural Reporting at the Jordan Media Institute in Amman (UNAOC, 
2013, Durra, 2016), which was considered a step towards Introducing the concept of digital 
literacy in Jordan  
 
The International Center for Journalists organized a training course at the Jordan Media 
Institute in 2013 on the use of electronic tools in public service issues, which dealt with 
preparing press reports, building electronic news websites, media ethics in the electronic age 
and social media, and how to em ploy This is in its coverage of issues related to public 
services with the participation of media professionals and journalists from several Arab 
countries (Jordan Media Institute, 2013).  
 
Accordingly, it appears that the stages by which the adoption of th e digital media literacy 
concept by Jordanian official institutes was not part of a clear process and policy based on a 
strategy for developing this concept and benefiting from it while not being adopted by the

Jordanian government and placing it among its  priorities during the period before 2014. They 
were just initiatives by international institutions and Jordanian civil society institutions.  
 
Challenges That Face the Implementation of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan  
Recently, the concept of digital lit eracy has entered, which is broader and more 
comprehensive than media literacy, but it is not a substitute for it. Rather, it needs a broader 
awareness of basic skills such as reading, writing, understanding, and accessing new 
technologies (Park, 2012)  
 
The state of digital media literacy in the Arab world, including Jordan, is weak, as interest in 
it comes at the bottom of the list of priorities for Arab countries, noting that it reflects the 
state of media itself (Saleh, 2009). On other words, the digit al media literacy in the Arab 
world is still in the initial foundational stages (Melki, 2013).  
 
The challenges facing digital media literacy are summarized by several reasons, including 
political, economic, and social (culture). For instance, The Arab wor ld, including Jordan, 
neglected digital media literacy for a long time, which led to negative consequences that 
exacerbated the seriousness of political and economic unrest (Abu -Fadil, 2016).  Many 
obstacles stand in front of the spread of media and digital  literacy, such as the structure of the 
media, which in turn does not provide the opportunity for a sufficient number of voices to 
participate, and the various political and social situations restrict the flow and availability of 
information, in addition t o the imbalance in the ability of individuals to communicate their 
opinions and voices (Assal, 2016).  Among the factors affecting Digital Media Literacy in 
Jordan are the economic weakness and the high costs of production and publishing with the 
lack of financial support provided for the development of human resources and education, on 
which media literacy depends on  (Saleh, 2009).  
 
Moreover, Arab higher education systems suffer from the absence of facilities and equipment 
that require digital literacy, a nd individual academic initiatives that called for media literacy 
in Arab universities were met with opposition and lack of support from traditional academics, 
while most of these educational systems do not realize the importance of digital media 
literacy.  In addition, it does not feel that it should be integrated into the school curriculum 
(Melki and Maaliki, 2016).  
 
Although Jordanian youth have  the skill and intelligence to use  digital technologies, they 
mostly still  unaware of the dangers of social medi a, and that most of these young people are 
ignorant of  the Internet thr eat such as privacy threat. D espite their extensive use of social 
media, they cannot be described as fruitful producers. Consequently , Jordanian youth who 
used the I nternet have suffere d from the lack of effective application of blogs. Like young 
bloggers in many other developing countries (Mohamed, 2017) they  predominantly blogged 
about  entertainment and light news  indicating  the lack of their awareness regarding the power 
of these mean s in influencing social and political views (Melki, 2015).  Despite the 
challenges, the application of digital media literacy in Jordan y has witnessed remarkable 
developments  during the recent period and this  will be discussed in the next section.  
 
Develop ment of Digital Media Literacy in Jordan  
Recently, digital media literacy has been developed remarkably, as these developments were 
represented in several stages, the beginning of which was in 2010, when the Jordanian

academics became aware and interested in the concept of digital media literacy and they 
pressured the politicians to  pay closer attention to this concept.  In response, new researches 
and studies were published to delineate and discuss  the concept of digital media literacy .  
Jordanian academics  were focused on identifying  the tools that individuals must possess to 
qualify them to interact with the media in a positive way. For instance, Ash diefat & 
Khasawneh, (2012) studied  the extent to which Jordanian school students possess the concept 
of digi tal media literacy, which gave a simplified picture of the scene. , Assal (2016) studied 
the extent of parents' awareness of digital media literacy and the importance of this concept to 
them because of its potential.  
 
Subsequently, the UNESCO Amman office l aunched a project to support the media in 
Jordan, with funding from the European Union, starting from 2014 until 2017, and the project 
included developing media education capabilities (UNESCO, 2014). In addition  to this , the 
Jordan Media Institute, in part nership with UNESCO, launched the Media and Information 
Education Project in Jordan in May 2016, which comes within the main project to support the 
media in Jordan, which UNESCO began implementing in 2014 with funding from the 
European Union (Jordan Media Institute, 2016).  
 
The project came  in two phases; the first included  the institute’s development of a Jordanian 
public policy paper in the field of media and information educatio n in educational 
institutions. The paper  analyze d the universities curricula  and the extent to which they 
contain media literacy concepts. The paper suggested a strategy that will work to introduce 
these concepts, while the second phase introduced the concept of  Media education in 
educational curricula within the framework of coop eration  with relevant parties that included 
the Ministry of Education and the Jordanian universities. Among others, this Initiative wanted 
to train male and female teachers on media and information literacy skills so that they can  
transfer  the necessary kn owledge  to students of grades seven, eight and nine in a number of 
schools (Jordan Media Institute, 2016)  
 
In 2016, the Jordan Media Institute launched the Jordanian Media Credibility Observatory 
(Akeed) with an important role in providing recipients with digital media literacy skills and 
enhancing th eir presence among individuals The observatory contributed  by verifying and 
monitoring media content published in the Jordanian media to enhance the quality of 
information by stressing on  the elements of object ivity, c redibility and accuracy . It also 
proposed for awareness be imparted to  Jordanians so that they can  verify t hose elements in 
the messages they receive . (Akeed.jo, 2016)  
 
The objectives of the observatory reinforce d the objectives of the existence of digital media 
literacy by protecting individuals and groups from the negative and unethical influences that 
may exist in the media content. It also enhances the accessibility skill of the recipient by 
assigning the human  right to knowledge by being able to achieve objecti vity and separate  
between news and advertisements,  between facts and speculation and the separation of 
information, facts on the one hand, and imagination and emotions on the other hand, and it 
also contr ibutes to providing students and journalists with the tools necessary to enhance 
future media education programs (Durra, 2016).  In 2018, the Jordanian government adopted 
the policy paper on digital media literacy that was drafted by the Jordan Media Instit ute in 
partnership with the European Union and UNESCO. Followed by training for school and

university students on digital media literacy concepts through several training programs 
funded by external donors and most notably, UNESCO.  
 
Most recently, while be ing affected by the  global Corona pandemic, the government has 
developed, through the Ministry of Culture, an executive plan for ""the National Initiative for 
the Promotion of Media and Information literacy for the years (2020 -2023)"". Because of the 
dire ne ed to depend on digital technologies caused by the pandemic, the Ministryn develop ed 
a work program to improve society's ability to deal with information sources, news, and 
digital media tools. The strategic objective of the plan is to integrate media and informational 
literacy concepts and skills into the Jordanian educational system, publish them in schools 
and universities, incorporate the activities of cultural and youth institutions and civil society 
institutions, and spread awareness of them through t he media and in the public sphere.  
 
According to the general policy paper presented by the Jordanian government, these are the 
main  reasons why digital media literacy is a  societal necessity in Jordan:  
 
First: Knowledge Transfer Tool  
Digital Media literacy  is a tool for developing and reforming education and a tool for 
transferring knowledge through technology: T oday, t he use of information and 
communication technology (ICT) is  the most prominent and important tool in increasing 
access to education, raising  the quality of education using advanced teaching and learning 
methods, improving learning outcomes, and reforming educational systems management. 
(UNESCO,  2018)  
 
Second: Digital Media Literacy is Considered A Means of Social Integration .  
It can be point ed out that digital media literacy is an effective tool that improves 
opportunities for social harmony and opportunities for societal understanding and 
understanding, as the press and radio were used in early periods in the reproduction of more 
integrated societies that agreed on common large goals without exceeding the value of 
diversity, for example as happened in the Malaysia (Mohamed, 2018). Contemporary 
Jordanian society is now very diverse  mainly  due to the modern formation of society and the 
emergenc e of the state.  The waves of refugees that have not stopped over the course of six 
decades have increased society diversification, and although the state and society have been 
able to digest this diversity and reproduce it in many stations, Jordan still ne eds more in -
depth efforts in support of social integration processes, bridging gap s and some aspects of 
fragility. Thus  communication technology can assist  Jordanians to beco me more integrated 
by sharing and expressing through  digital and social media.  
 
Third: Bridging the Political and Social Participation Gap  
 Learning the skills of sharing information and producing and sharing media content is the 
basic feature of the communication and informat ion revolution, and the events and 
transformations that the  world is witnessing in the last decade confirm that this pattern of 
participation is contributing to determining the level, content and size of participation that 
individuals practice in various aspects of life, foremost of which is social and political 
participation. As is well known, participation is the solid foundation for development and 
modernization when the responsibility base expands. The quality of dealing with information 
and news improves opportunities for political participation, whether elect oral participation or 
participation in public affairs, in addition to the role of digital media education in improving

citizens' ability to accept equality and  seek it, specifically between g ender, the empowerment 
of women, and strengthening the participat ion of special groups.  
  
Digital media education today defines this way in which more generations can be brought up 
ready for positive and productive participation thanks to the cognitive and cultural cultivation 
of participation based on evaluation, selec tion of ideas and critical thinking.  Jordan suffers 
from a multi -faceted participation crisis, whether in the political or socio -economic 
dimensions, evidenced by the weak electoral participation that did not exceed 37% in the 
2016 Eighteenth Council elect ions. The gender gap in women's participation rates appears 
more obvious and embarrassing, as the rate of Jordanian women's economic participation in 
the labor market is still low and does not exceed 14%, compared with 30% at the Arab level 
and 50% at the global level, and weak and distorted participation extends to other sectors 
such as work. Volunteering and non -profit work, as this sector only accounts for 1.5%, 
compared to 5.5% of the global average ( Jordanian Department of Statistics, 2017).  
 
Fourth: R ationalize Societal Culture in Confronting Extremism and Hate Speech  
Digital media has become one of the open sources today that allows participation for young 
people, young and old, and at a time when the mass media and new information sources 
along with the traditional media have come to dominate a wide area of individuals' times, 
they have been transformed by the political conflict in the Middle East and North Africa 
regions. And others, to effective platforms for spreading extremism and spreading hate 
speech, as many reports indicate that these means have become a trap for hunting young 
people by terrorist organizations, in addition to their role in spreading extremist ideas and 
creating followers for them.  
 
Therefore, Jordanian youth find themselves in the midst of a torrent of information flow, and 
at a time when traditional educational institutions deny them expression, and traditional 
media do not give them real attention, young people find the new media of expression 
available on digita l media, specifically social media, an escape from exclusion and 
marginalization. Its ability does not depend on the inexpensive means it provides and without 
direct censorship, but rather allows anonymity, which has opened the way to anomalous 
expressions  such as expressions of cultural and verbal violence and hates speech on the one 
hand and extremist religious and political discourse.  
 
Digital media literacy contributes to a large extent to developing the capabilities of 
individuals to examine, evaluate,  accept or reject media messages, as what media literacy 
provides makes young people and new youths more immune to political and ideological 
propaganda, at the forefront of which is the distinction between messages with political and 
ideological goals and news. Impartial information makes the recipients more alert and aware 
of extremist messages.  
 
In order to benefit from the integration of digital media education, a plan had to be developed 
Implementation of the national initiative that  according to the Mi nister of Culture (Twissi, 
2020)  includes four areas  which are the  1) Schools, 2) Univesrities, 3) youth and cultural 
institutions and, $0 civil society and the public sphere in cities.

Area 1: Schools  
It includes training activities and access to about 90% of the Ministry of Education schools in 
the Kingdom's governorates, within 42 directorates of education and training, 3000 male and 
female teachers, and the introduction of digital media literacy concepts and skills to the 
educational curricula in the concerned classes and ensuring their sustainability, reviewing 
them, and developing student activities guides specialized in digital media education. For 
students of basic education and  establishing student clubs specialized in this field.  
 
 Area 2: Unive rsities  
 It aims to build the capacities of a group of faculty members in Jordanian universities, and to 
invite universities to offer specialized courses in digital media education and the 
establishment of university student clubs and parallel activities i n the field of media and 
information education. This  goal includes establishing 30 student clubs in the field of media 
and informational education and  working with teacher training colleges to offer educational 
programs in media and informatics education.  
 
 Area 3: Youth and Cultural Institutions  
 It aims to train and build capacity for members of the youth centers of the Ministry of Youth 
and the cultural bodies of the Ministry of Culture in all parts of the Kingdom, and to enable a 
group of youth centers and young women and cultural bodies to develop units for digital 
media awareness and the production of media and information content.  
 
 Area 4: Civil Society and The Public Sphere in Cities  
The plan aims to administer sub -grants targeting a group of civil society institutions 
interested in launching new and innovative initiatives in the fields of media and information 
education under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and the Office of the Minister of 
State for Media Affairs, and the implementation of awareness campaigns to spread the 
concepts of media education And informatics through a group of public service media, and 
the creation of a digital platform for free education and training.  
 
Conclusion and Recommendations  
In short , we have  explicated the challenges and development of di gital media literacy in 
Jordan. T he sequence of entering the concept of digital media literacy Jordan was reviewed, 
and the challenges that faced Jordan to apply the concepts of digital media literacy were 
presented. For instance, the digital media literacy programs that were implemented were 
financed and supported by external institutions in addition to the challenge of cultural 
awareness among young people in dealing with digital media correctly and in produc tive way 
was constituted as an obstacle for the digital media literacy in Jordan. The political 
challenges also clearly affected the progress of the development of digital media literacy 
through the various media outlets that represent the decision -makers opinions and control 
what is presented.  As for recent years, specifically, since 2018, government interest in the 
concept of digital media literacy became apparent  through practical steps that were 
manifested by the introduction of training programs in sch ools and universities and the 
development of a strategic plan for digital media literacy 2020 -2023.  
 
In response to the analyses provided, the au thors recommend for the Jordanian  authorities to 
further enhance their digital media initiatives by adopting  the following:

1. Establishing a clear digital media literacy curriculum in schools and universities as a 
separate and independent curriculum to be taught in theoretical and practical way, and 
to be designed locally in Jordan to comply with local culture and cu stoms.  
2. The teachers and trainers of digital media literacy must be specialized in digital media 
to provide content related to digital media literacy in a professional and beneficial 
way.  
3. Disseminating media messages through various media outlets explaining the 
importance of digital media literacy Which includes understanding media, 
contemporary communication, news literacy, information literacy, digital citizenship, 
to create a state of public trust and cognitive immunization in the face of rumors  and 
misinformation, and this perspective is committed to promoting the principles of 
human rights, freedom o f expression and gender justice . 
 
The paper concludes by confirming that the potential of digital media literacy in Jordan is 
very positive. If the  government and the relevant authorities maintain their commitment to 
realize the strategic plans that are already in place, it won’t  be long before Jordanians become 
savvy technology users, and Jordan will become the leader on digital media literacy 
especi ally in the Arab world. The authors also propose for more studies to be conducted to 
understand how digital media literacy can be made more effective and relevant when it is 
studied within the context of a particular culture and socio -political backgrounds . Such 
studies can provide more avenues for comparing the applicability of different digital media 
literacy methods and modules.

Abstract:  This study investigated the use of digital storytelling in improving students’ visual memory and 
writing skill of tenth grade students in one of senior high school in Tangerang, Indonesia. A tota l of 72 
students are taken as the sample in the current study. The randomized pretest - posttest control group design 
was used in the study. Using quasi experimental research -non-equivalent control group design, the students 
in the experimental groups comp leted the process through digital storytelling. The students’ test and 
questionnaires were used to collect the data. In order to test whether there was an improvement within 
groups and to see if there were differences between groups, the hypotheses were te sted using the t -test and 
obtaining gain scores. The result showed that the visual memory and writing skill of students undergoing 
digital storytelling technique and of those undergoing conventional teaching but no significant differences 
were found betwee n the two conditions. They had same proficiency, focused and same concentration during 
the learning process, and the students had many opinions in experimental class. Based on the percentages , 
students’ post -test showed that students’ visual memory was mor e dominant than students’ writing skill after 
applying digital storytelling. Moreover, this research also found that students’ learning motivation was very 
good and created a good of class atmosphere in experimental class during the learning process by usi ng 
digital storytelling.

INTRODUCTION  
In the acquisition and fluency of language skills 
may be directly involved visual memory. 
Magnussen (2009) , said that memory is retain 
stimulus information in memory which is 
assessed in term precision. Visual memory is  one 
of the ability  to remember or recall such as 
images, scenes, words , and other  information  
which  presented visually. Visual  memory is 
important to develop, because according to 
Phillips & Christie (2013) , visual  memory  has a 
role in a wide variety  of everyday  tasks. It  has 
also been considered  fundamental  on every  type 
of academic  learning. The students  should be able 
to visualiz e the stimulus  in their mind.  Visual memory is a complex process for 
students. Current  theory  of visual working 
memory inv olving capacity and resolution as the 
two important aspects of visual working memory 
storage  (Yao, Chen, and Qian 2018) . The memory 
storage system of working memory includes 
subsystems . They maintain verbal, spatial, and 
visual information. The feel  is so hard to 
remember with what they have seen, so the 
students should learn and  understand the ability to 
store and recall mental images  in the memory  
efficiently  to help their learning a foreign 
language (Michel et al. 2019) . This memory will 
store in short -term memory, as many as students 
should remember with the duration is briefly to Imam Sudarmaji, Agus Mulyana, & Karsiyah  
Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students’ visual memory and writing skill  
 256 see. Acco rding to Baddeley et al., (2015)  that 
short -term memory is able to store limited 
quantities of information for limited periods of 
time. So if the students’ did not pay attention, 
they will feel difficult in pl acing visual which 
means that they need stimuli for be able to 
visualize. The students may have difficulty during 
several operations such as remembering general 
view of words in reading and writing, also 
sequencing the letters if such skills have  not 
impro ved.   
While, writing is one of the four skills in 
English. The students felt that writing is as more 
complicated than the other skills  and became 
challenging area of language learning (Jabali 
2018) . Javed et al., (2013)  said that even native 
speakers of English can feel difficulty in 
demonstrating a good of writing. The students 
often feel confused when they are using the rules 
of writing such as grammatical and they also lac k 
of vocabulary. According to Ma’azi & Janfesha n 
(2018) and Nik et al., (2010)  said that writing has 
an important role which is assumed as the most 
complex process.  Sylvester & Greenidge (2009)  
stated that writing has difficulty to start and it is a 
very complex process to write, although after the 
teacher assists the students for prewriting 
activities such as brainstorming to generate the 
ideas or supports an upcoming writing 
assignment. Learning to write is a difficult and 
complex process because it concerned with the 
knowledge a bout the structure of language  
Rusinovci (2015) . Students also need to know 
how to express their idea, feeling, opinion, critical 
thinking in written text (Fadhly 2014) .   
The stud ents still do not understand how to 
write in English and they don’t know their 
mistakes on their writing. The technique or 
strategies to teach writing may not be interesting 
for the students. Klimova (2014)  claimed that if 
the teacher uses appropriate technique/strategies 
to teach the students, it can be more inter esting 
and considers students’ personality. Writing 
instruction in language teaching and learning can 
improve students’ writing skill (Coker et al. 
2018) . Teacher should pay attention to the 
students’ writing strategies and the types of 
writing instructions (Bai 2018; Palermo and 
Thomson 2018)  
The current advancement in the information 
and communicatio n technology (ICT) or digital 
era has provided the learners with various tools 
with the form of computer -based or Internet -
based resources . Many teachers n ow use  digital 
tools in addition to other instruction methods and not as a substitute learning  (Hillmayr et al. 2020) . 
Digital Learning can help students take charge of 
their own lear ning and make them fun (Schmoelz 
2018; Zwart et al. 2020) . The use of digital 
technology can amplify this experience and 
provide a concrete support in the development of 
language and communication skills  (Rubegni and 
Landoni 2018; Thang et al. 2 014). One of the 
technique in language teaching is digital 
storytelling  (DST) . DST technique  helps students 
develop their better language skills and this 
technique can be considered as an essential tool in 
foreign language learning and teaching  (Razmi, 
Pourali, and Nozad 2014) .  
DST which combines the characteristic of 
storytelling with different interactive media tools 
can benefit language learning in a variety of 
ways. It was found to encourage and motivate 
students and  at the same time enhance their 
communication skills (Ciğerci and Gultekin 2017; 
Thang et al. 2014) . DST helps students to find, 
apply, learn, and share each other various amount 
of vocabulary and moreover helps them to think 
critically due to the limitation of script writing 
and presen ted digitally (Tajeri, Syal, and Marzban 
2017) . Teachers can provide students a sharing 
experience to enhance learning through seeing, 
hearing, and feeling (Beck and Sitzman 2019) . 
DST is also a good technique that suitable for 
the students to teach visual memory and  writing, 
also can help the students to improve their visual 
memory capacity and writing skill  (Sarica and 
Usluel 2016) . Some researcher s said that digital 
storytelling gives positive effect for the students. 
According to Gallets (2005)  that through 
storytelling, students can be mo re thinking and 
imaginative skill. Also their mental process 
played more active role. Story will influence 
memory, and the storytelling can facilitate 
students’ cognitive changes (Schank and Abelson 
1995) . Besides visual memory, digital storytelling 
can be used as an effective learning tool to 
improve students’ writing skill (Xu et al., 2011; 
Campbell, 2012; Yang & Wu, 2012; Sarica & 
Usluel, 2016; Yamaç & Ulusoy, 2016; Tarigan & 
Liana, 2018) . Abdel -Hack & Helwa (2014)  also 
said that through digital storytelling, narrative 
writing and critical thinking skills were 
developed.  
In the latest decade, many researc her 
conducted the research to investigate the use of 
digital story telling in language learning.  First, 
Eman Mohamed & Hasnaa Sabry, (2014)  had a 
research which investigated the effectiveness of 
using digital storytelling and Weblogs instruction ENGLISH REVIEW: Journal of English Education

257  in enhancing EFL narrative writing and critical 
thinking skills a mong EFL majors at Faculty of 
Education. The result showed that using digital 
storytelling and Weblogs instruction is effective 
in enhancing the EFL narrative writing and 
critical thinking skills among EFL majors at 
Faculty of Education.  Second, Sarica & Usluel, 
(2016)  investigated the effect of digital 
storytelling on the visual memory capacity and 
writing skills of students  in primary school . Then, 
Tarigan & Liana, (2018)  conducted the research 
to examine the effectiveness of us ing digital story 
telling in teaching writing skill of students in 
higher education or university. The result showed 
that the students’ writing skill are improved after 
implementing digital story telling as the teaching 
media. The study showed that digital  story telling 
is effective to enhance students’ writing skill. The 
previous research focus on the subject in primary 
school and university. The current study intend to 
confirm  the use of digital storytelling as a 
language  teaching technique  in foreign lan guage 
class  in senior secondary school . The focus of the 
study is to know whether there is any significant 
effect of digital storytelling on the students’ 
visual memory and writing skill,  to know which 
one is more dominant between students’ visual 
memory a nd writing skill , and to know how the 
students’ learning motivation and class 
atmosphere through applying digital storytelling .   
 
METHOD  
This study used experimental method. The design 
of this study was a quasi -experimental research - 
non-equivalent contro l group design. The 
researcher chose this design, because according to 
Fraenkel  et al., (2012)  there were two different 
classes’ treatment, namely experimental class and 
control class, and do not include the use of 
random assignment.  This study was conducted 
by the researcher who taught in two different 
classes, namely experimental  class and control 
class. Where experimental class was the class that 
applied by using digital storytelling, and control 
class that applied by using conventional  teaching 
(gallery walk).

The population of this study was all of 
students in tenth grade in one senior high school 
in Tangerang in Academic Year 2019/2020. 
While, the sample was students in MIPA  (Science 
Class) 1  as the experimental group  and MIPA 
(Science) Class 2  as the control group . The 
researcher chose the sample based on the 
previous information, their pro ficiency, and their 
relevancy with the study purpose.   
The data of this study was quantitative data. 
The quantitative data were obtained by the scores 
of students’ task from pre -test and post -test.  
Writing test instrument and questionnaire are 
used to co llect the data. After the students’ visual 
memory and writing scores had been collected, 
the researcher analyzed the data using one paired 
t-test to see the comparison between pre -test and 
post-test mean scores and to see the effect of 
using  digital  storyt elling on students’ visual 
memory  and writing skill. It also enabled the 
researcher to know the dominant between visual 
memory and writing skill after applying digital 
storytelling. While, questionnaire were used to 
know the added value that wanted to be k nown in 
the achievement of students’ learning outcomes 
was the students’ learning motivation and class 
atmosphere.  
 
RESULTS  AND DISCUSSION  
The classroom observation data showed that the 
result of experimental class and control class. In 
experimental class,  the researcher started by 
giving materials about narrative text and how to 
write narrative text by using digital, it such as by 
Power Point. Then, show the videos of the stories 
including with the sound system. After students 
watched, some pictures of the  stories showed to 
them. They have to remember and understand of 
the story and can re -write the story of narrative 
text that they remembered. While, in control class 
the researcher gave the material about narrative 
text and how to write it by using convent ional 
teaching (gallery walk). They have to remember Imam Sudarmaji, Agus Mulyana, & Karsiyah  
Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students’ visual memory and writing skill  
 258 and understand on it. The researcher rewrite the 
sample of story by written on the whiteboard. 
Then, asked the students to rewrite the story of 
narrative text that they remembered.   
This research also m easured the level of 
motivation of students after learning by using 
digital storytelling technique. Questionnaire of 
learning motivation that has been given to the 
students in experimental class during the learning 
process. Besides measuring of the learnin g 
motivation, researcher also measured the level of 
the class atmosphere. The score of class 
atmosphere was obtained from questionnaire that 
has been given to the students in experimental 
class during the learning process by using digital 
storytelling tech nique.   
  
Students’ score of visual memory   
The students’ score in experimental class and 
control class are increased. As the Minimum 
Mastery Criterion (KKM) at the tenth grade is 67. 
Based on the result that there was no students not 
pass on visual memo ry in experimental class that 
taught by using digital storytelling technique. 
100% students can pass KKM values means the 
students got the score than 67 as KKM values.  
While, based on the visual memory test that 
was given in control class the researcher g ot the 
total score was 11% students could not pass KKM 
values and 89% students could pass KKM values. 
It means, almost all of students in control class 
have score more than 67. Even though there are 
several students got the score gain with KKM 
values.   
 
Students’ score of writing skill  
The students’ score in experimental class and 
control class are increased, but many students 
have a score below the minimum criteria (KKM). 
In experimental class 42% students could not 
achieve KKM values and 58% students co uld 
achieve KKM values. While, in control class 56% 
students could not achieve KKM values and 44% 
students could achieve KKM values. It can be 
seen from graphic below:

Students’ learning motivation in experimental 
class  
In this research, the students’ learning motivation 
which measured by criteria that is consists of 1% 
- 20% = bad, 21% - 40% = not good, 41% - 60% 
= sufficient, 61% - 80% = good, 81% - 100% = 
very go od. This research analyzed by obtaining 
the total score of learning motivation, and got the 
total was 2321. So, based on the criteria of 
percentages that can be categorized that the 
students’ learning motivation was very good 
during the learning process by  using digital 
storytelling with percentages 81%.  
 
Class a tmosphere in experimental class  
The  questionnaire  of  class atmosphere 
has six statements which is given by the 
researcher to know the students’ perception and 
participation about class atmospher e during the 
learning process. The result of every statements 
can be explained as follows:

261  experimental class and control class at the tenth 
grade of high school in Tangerang. So, digital 
storytelling that applied by the researcher  has no 
difference to improve the students’ writing  skill at 
the tenth of high school in Tangerang.  
From the students’ analysis of visual memory 
and writing skill taught by using digital 
storytelling in experimental class and by using 
gallery walk in cont rol class, the researcher has 
found the result of students’ visual memory and 
writing skill. The researcher have just given the 
pre-test, treatment, and post -test in order to know 
the students’ visual memory and writing skill.   
The result of teaching visu al memory and 
writing skill taught by the researcher using digital 
storytelling technique was good, because the 
students’ scores are increased between pre -test 
and post -test score. So, their visual memory and 
writing skill had improved. The score of post -test 
was higher than pre -test. In visual memory 100% 
students can pass KKM values and in writing skill 
58% students can pass KKM values. Based on the 
percentages, students’ post -test of visual memory 
is more dominant than writing skill after applying 
digita l storytelling technique.   
The testing of research hypotheses indicated 
that Ho is accepted and Ha is rejected, it means 
there is no significant difference of using digital 
storytelling on the students’ visual memory and 
writing skill. This research is re lated with the 
previous research such as from Sarica & Usluel 
(2016)  about visual memory that is no statistical 
difference was found that the  students  less 
interaction  with visuals  in experimental class than  
control class. But , this research did not 
correspond to Sarica & Usluel (2016)  for writing  
skill that can be said the significant result to 
improve  writing skill of students in experimental 
and control class. Also from Yamaç & Ulusoy 
(2016)  stated that through digital  storytelling  
could successfully result in improvement 
students’ writing skill. Tarigan & Liana (2018)  
said that the students’ writing skill after using  
digital  storytelling technique was significantly 
higher than before their used. Although 
fundamentally that vi sual memory need  to take  a 
long time to  develop, because the  development of 
memory  capacity begins in  infancy and continues  
through  early  adulthood (Terry, 2009) . While, 
also for  writing is assumed the most difficult to 
be learnt by the student s. As Brown (2007)  stated 
that there are many aspects that can be assessed 
when the teacher s measure the students’ writing  
skill such as content, organization, grammar, vocabulary, mechanic and the score of writing 
test was taken based on proficiency categories.  
In this research, there is no different between 
experimental and control class. Although there is 
no activities related to the digital storytelling were 
conducted in control class, because the condition 
of the students were same and had same 
proficiency. They focused and had concentration 
when researcher/teacher taught the students either 
by digital  storytelling or gallery walk, but the 
students have many opinions in experimental 
class. So that the learning outc omes obtained 
almost same or have  no different.   
Based on this matter, the researcher 
conducted by giving questionnaire to get the 
students’ learning motivation and atmosphere 
class during the learning process in experimental 
class by using digital storyt elling technique. The 
result showed that the application of this 
technique had proven to have a very good effect 
in increasing learning motivation. In addition, this 
technique also could create a good and conducive 
classroom atmosphere, students active to ask and 
students able to solve problem. Witte & Rogge 
(2014)  stated  that if the students are active during 
the learning process, so the technique has positive 
effect and it can believe the students’ learning 
motivation and class atmosphere were better.  
 
CONCLUSION  
The students’ score of visual  memory in 
experimental  class are increased after applying 
digital storytelling. The students’ score of post -
test was higher that pre -test, it was 100% students 
can pass KKM (Minimum Mastery Criterion) 
values. While, the students’ score of writing  skill 
in experimental class als o increased after 
applying  digital  storytelling. The score of post -
test was higher than pre -test, it was 58% students 
can pass KKM values. So, the level of 
achievement of the KKM values from these had 
improved.  
Based on the percentages of students’ post -
test score that visual  memory was more dominant 
than writing skill after applying digital  
storytelling  at the tenth grade students of higher 
school in Tangerang in academic year 2019/2020.  
The result of statistic which obtained by 
analyzing data through t -test of statistic 
calculation, it indicated that Ho is accepted and 
Ha is rejected which means that there is no 
significant difference of using  digital storytelling  
on the students’  visual  memory and writing  skill 
at the tenth grade of higher school in Tan gerang . Imam Sudarmaji, Agus Mulyana, & Karsiyah  
Applying digital storytelling to improve Indonesian high school students’ visual memory and writing skill  
 262 Some factors influenced no statistical 
difference between experimental class and control 
class due to the condition of students were same 
proficiency, and from both of classes that the 
students focused and had concentration when the 
teacher giving the materials either by digital  
storytelling or gallery walk, also the students in 
experimental have many opinions during the 
learning process. So, that the learning outcomes 
were same or no have different.   
  Although there is no statistical different, 
digital  storytelling can contribute in experimental 
class. It can be proved from the students’ 
questionnaire showed that the students’ learning 
motivation  was very good and created a good  
class atmosphere. Almost all of students are 
interested with the tech nique of teaching and they 
are active during the learning process by using  
digital  storytelling.

  ii  Summary  
In recent years, rice in Bangladesh is increasingly being grown in the dr y (boro) season 
which lasts from January to May. Unlike the rice grown in the monsoon season when 
there is rain, boro rice is mainly produced with ground water irrigation.  
The treatment being studied is a water -management technique for irrigated rice called 
Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). AWD involves inserting a perforated PVC pipe into the soil to allow the farmer to observe soil moisture below the surface. The AWD guidelines suggest that the farmer let the field dry until the water level reaches 15 c m 
below the surface —  which has a visible marking within the pipe. Once this water level is 
reached, the farmer should re- irrigate the field up to a level that depends on the current 
status of the crop. The process of alternatively wetting and drying the field should be 
practiced until the time that the crop starts to flower or reproduce . The farmer should 
keep suffi cient water in the field during flowering because the crop water requirements 
are much higher during flowering relative to the previous vegetat ive stage of growth. The 
farmer also drains the field approximately one to two weeks before harvest, regardless of 
their chosen method of irrigation. AWD is meant to reduced total irrigation withdraw 
relative to a system where the field is never allowed to  dry, i.e. “continuous flooding”.  
Previous studies suggest that this simple technology saves about 25- 30% of irrigation 
water. AWD has been developed and tested since 2004 but no systematic evaluation was undertaken until now. A precious 3ie funded non- experimental study Meenakshi et 
al. (2012)  in West Bengal found that metering may reduce water use in the dry season 
and also reduce water sales.  
The goal of the project is to evaluate the effect  of AWD relative to conventional flood 
irrigation in rice. Our main question is: what is the impact of AWD adoption on farm 
incomes and water savings? How do these impacts vary across different physical and 
institutional environments such as shallow and deep water tables, pricing regimes for 
irrigation water and communal vs private tube well ownership? What is the farmer’s 
willingness to pay for AWD technology? Because of the positive effect of AWD in 
reducing the depletion of groundwater stocks and lowering methane emissions from rice 
fields, there may be a gap between private and social benefits of the technology, necessitating the use of subsidies for widespread adoption by farmers.  
In Phase 1 we start with 400 villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur and Mymensingh  division of 
Bangladesh, divided into two experimental groups. Ten farmers in the 200 treatment villages were provided with the AWD pipe and instructions on its benefits and training on 
using it to measure soil moisture. The farmers in the remaining 200 vi llages act as a pure 
control. This first phase allows us to estimate the average treatment effect of AWD 
across the whole population of farmers.  
We find that the profitability of the AWD technology depends crucially on whether 
farmers face volumetric prices. AWD has no effect on profits with seasonal water 
charges, consistent with the observation that water management did not change in this 
setting. Volumetric prices, on the other hand, incentivize use o f the technology: we find a 
significant increase in farm profits of about 7%. Overall, this first experiment suggests 
that there may be a fundamental market failure that explains why farmers do not value a iii  water - saving technology with proven results in the laboratory: they face a zero marginal 
price of water . 
In Phase 2, we conducted a RCT to estimate the causal effect of encouraging hourly 
irrigation prices on the valuation of water -saving technology by farmers. In Northwestern 
Bangladesh, there are 4,000 community tube wells that are equipped with meters that can take prepaid debit cards and release irrigation water. Farmers can load their own 
cards with funds at a nearby kiosk and obtain irrigation water on demand. This solution is 
low-cost, implementable and aligns incentives for efficient water use. Our t reatment 
seeks to increase the penetration of prepaid card usage in order to examine the causal link between pricing policy and technology adoption and to test a scalable solution for 
implementing volumetric pricing. 1  
We identified 144 villages which have installed meters, but use of prepaid cards by 
individual farmers is almost non -existent. 2 In order to encourage hourly pricing for water, 
we randomly selected 96 villages for a campaign to assist farmers in obtaining their own 
debit cards. Many farmers at tribute the low rate of individual card ownership to the costs 
associated with the application process. Our treatment sought to reduce these costs by organizing a meeting with farmers to explain the purpose of the prepaid cards, help them fill out the pape r application, obtain the photograph needed, pay the application fee of  
$1.9, deliver the forms to the irrigation authority, pick up the cards once complete, and deliver them to farmers. Once in hand, a farmer can load the card with funds —  the 
same way as  a mobile phone — and purchase water from the village tube well.
 
Encouraging hourly billing in the second RCT causes the demand for AWD to become less price responsive. Demand elasticity falls by 33% from 1.7 to 1.14 when comparing treatment and control vi llages. At the four highest prices, the hourly cards increase 
purchase of AWD by 35%. We find no effect on uptake at the four lowest prices. This demand experiment also lets us estimate the value farmers place on this conservation technology. Consumer surplus — when measured at our median price of $0.7 —  
increases by 64% in prepaid card treatment villages.  
Yet, demand for AWD is low, both among treatment and control farmers. Using a survey with local shop owners, we estimate the marginal cost of production of the pipe to be $1.66 — a price well above the level at which demand falls to zero. Only about 20% of 
the purchasing farmers were found to be using the technology when field staff returned 
to check on usage.  Nonetheless, we estimate that a 1% increase in price decreases 
                                                
1 It is scalable because the policymaker only needs to provide farmers with payment cards and 
install a single meter at each pump, rather than individual meters for each pl ot. 
2 In most  cases  the tube well operator  maintains  a few cards,  manages  the allocation  of water  to 
farmers, and provides them with equal per -acre bills regardless of their individual consumption. 
The bills are most often paid in two installments: at the beginning and at the end of the season. 
One of the main benefits of this approach — from the perspective of the tube well operator — is 
the ease of tracking. The operator only  needs  to observe how much money  is being used  on his 
cards  and acreage  cultivate d by each farmer, rather  than keep track  of the individual  hours  
pumped.  The operator  levies  a markup before calculating the per -acre cost to be charged to each 
farmer. The per -acre charge makes it easier to conceal this markup: the per hour cost of pumping 
is generally known to farmers.  iv  usage by 2.6% in control villages but only by 0.6% for farmers with hourly irrigation 
cards. That is, the price -usage elasticity shows the same pattern as the price- purchase 
elasticity.  
From a policy point of view, we show that if the incentives are aligned correctly, there is a 
demand for the AWD technology. We see higher purchase and usage rates, and water 
savings and a small but significant increase in farm profits. Policy makers should 
consider two options: first, promote the AWD technology in areas where farmers pay 
volumetric pricing. Second, consider mechanisms that can allow a transition from seasonal water prices to paying by volume. This could be done by retrofitting existing tubewells to accept debit cards wherever possible, strea mlining the system for debit card 
application, reducing application costs and creating infrastructure such that these cards 
can be easily recharged, and retrofiting tubewells that work with debit cards.

TOC   Theo ry of Change 1  1. Introduction  
We use two randomized controlled trials in Bangladesh to study a simple water 
conservation technology for rice production called “Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD).” 
Despite proven results in agronomic trials, our first experiment shows that AWD only saves water and increases profits in villages where farmers pay a marginal price for water, but not when they pay fixed seasonal charges. The second RCT randomly 
distributed debit cards that can be used to pay volumetric prices for i rrigation wat er. This 
low-cost, scalable intervention causes farmers to place more value on the water -saving 
technology. Demand for the technology becomes less price- sensitive.  
This study is the first rigorous field experiment that examines the role of pri cing 
mechanisms in agricultural water use, although numerous agronomic studies have been 
done in experiment stations, see, e.g., Zhang et al.  (2012).  It shows that a lack of 
incentives  — creat ed by water pricing —  inhibits technology adoption and use. 
Facilitating access to debit cards for hourly irrigation alters demand and increases the 
value farmers place on water -saving technology. While many economists have 
highlighted the need for water pricing reform as a means to increased conservation, there is little evidence that policy intervention can alter pricing regimes at the local level, especially in developing countries. Our study shows that modest efforts to lower 
application costs and increase farmer access to marginal pricing have significant positive 
effects on the demand for water -conservation technology. These findings have 
implications for numerous countries across the world where fixed prices for agricultural 
water persist while at the  same time water is becoming increasingly scarce.  
In Sections 2 and 3 we discuss the intervention and evaluation questions and methods. In Section 4, we discuss implementation fidelity. In Sections 5 and 6, we discuss in detail 
the procedure and results fo r the two phases of the study conducted. In Section 7 we 
estimate the social benefits of the technology. In Sections 8 and 9 we provide discussion 
and conclusions and recommendations.  
2. Intervention 
2.1 Description  
We are using a combination of a cluster randomi zed control trial with partial equilibrium 
welfare analysis to rigorously measure the impact of AWD. In Phase 1 we start with 400 
villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur and Mymens ingh districts of Bangladesh. These areas  
were chosen to encompass the different water  sources and ways in which farmers pay 
for irrigation water in the country. We elaborate more on this in Section 3.2.  The villages 
were first divided into two experimental groups. Ten farmers in the 200 treatment villages 
were random ly selected who cultivated plots close to the tubewell. They were provided 
with the AWD pipe free of cost. We also provided that same group of farmers with a training on the benefits of the AWD pipe and how to use it to measure soil moisture. The training was conducted as a classroom session simultaneously with all 10 farmers. After 
the training the field staff went to the study plot of each farmer and assisted them 1 -by-1 
with the installation of the pipe. Both the training and installation was adm inistered by 
employees of a local NGO who themselves were trained by IRRI, Bangladesh Agricultural University, and the Department of Agricultural Extension.  2  The farmers in the remaining 200 villages act as a pure c ontrol. This delivers our 
counterfactual f or estimating the average treatment effect of AWD across the whole 
population of farmers.  
For phase 2 of the study, farmers are drawn from a new set of villages distinct from 
phase 1 villages. We chose 144 villages –  96 of them received the treatment in the form 
of access to debit card applications while the rest of the 48 villages served a control. 25 
farmers were selected in each village. All of them received the random AWD price offer 
(i.e. subsidy).  
2.2 Theory of change  
The causal pathway in the theory of c hange is shown in Figure 1.  Focusing on phase I of 
the study, the key input will be the actual AWD pipe. The first intermediate outcome will 
be for the pipe to be installed and used. The TOC divides this outcome into two 
possi bilities. First, we expect installation and take up (where take up refers to actually 
using the pipe) to be higher in areas where incentives are aligned, i.e. in areas where 
farmers pay a marginal price for their irrigation water (the top pathway). Second,  we 
expect take up to be lower in areas where water is not priced volumetrically (the bottom 
pathway). This hypothesis is based on two assumptions that are highlighted in blue: the 
existence of a marginal price for water is a key incentive for adoption and  that there is no 
warm glow effect where farmers are willing to use AWD and save water just for the purposes of helping the environment and saving water for future generations. Notably, the existence of such an effect only works in favor of finding impacts  of AWD on 
intermediate and final outcomes.  
After the AWD pipe is installed and farmers begin to use it, the next step in the causal  
chain is for continued use throughout the season. Farmers will need to use the AWD 
pipe as a soil moisture monitor — meaning they will need to look in it periodically and 
decide when to irrigate. There are again two key assumptions underlying this pathway (in 
blue in the TOC). First, farmers know how to use the AWD pipe. We will address this by 
providing all farmers with simpl e and easy -to-follow guidelines at the time of installation. 
Second, farmers can only use AWD if they can obtain water when they need it.  
All of these things translate into final impacts on crop yield (where we expect no change), 
water use (decrease), methane production from rice (decrease), weeding costs (possibly 
increase) and agricultural profit (unclear). Various studies have reported a de-  crease in 
methane production and potentially higher weeding costs because weeds tend to grow in 
under less flooded conditions, see e.g., Alam et al.  (2009).

2.3 Monitoring plan 
A baseline survey was conducted for each of the 10 farmers in all the 400 villages from 
the treatment and control groups. This was done mostly in December 2016. This survey 
was designed to elicit demographic information, and important information about 
cropping systems and water payment mechanisms. AWD pipes were installed in early 2017 in plots for the 10 farmers in the 200 treatment villages. Farmers receiving the pipe 
were assisted with the installation and received training on the use of the technology.  
Throughout the rice growing season, we measured the water levels on each study  plot 
twice. These measurements were carried out around dates that were randomly selected. 
These measurements were in the form of the height of the standing water in the plot. 
Pictures were also taken of the plot to corroborate the measurement.  
Methane emi ssions were measured using a closed chamber technique in consultation 
with scientific experts on methane gas chromatography. 104 villages were selected at 
random for this measurement. One plot was randomly drawn from each village. 10 
methane readings were taken for 24 of these plots, and three readings were taken for each of the remaining 80 plots. All were taken on randomly selected days. The total number of observations was 480, where each observation is composed of 3 vials of gas. 
However, a failure of t he gas chromatograph equipment resulted in noisy results for the 
effect of treatment on methane emissions. We do not report those results in this 
document.  
4  Finally, a follow -up survey was done after the boro season for all 4,000 farmers in the 
sample. The goal is to measure profitability of the AWD technology and collect 
information on water use.  
For the phase 2 experiment, i n addition to observing AWD purchasing decisions, and 
tracing out the demand curve with and without the introduction of individual vol umetric 
water pricing, we collected data on whether the pipe was installed and water levels in the 
field. Similar to our first RCT, we randomly drew dates to visit each of the 144 villages. 
These dates were drawn to fall in the 10 -70 day  period after plant ing, when we observed 
farmers from the first experiment practicing AWD. The visits took place during February 2nd - May 23rd 2018, with the median visit occurring on April 1st.  
 During each visit, the enumerator checked all the plots of each farmer to see if an AWD 
pipe was being used. In addition, water levels were measured on the plot closest to the tube well for a random 75% of farmers and the farthest plot for the rest of the sample. 
These additional data allow us to decompose any treatment effects into  effects on initial 
valuation at the time of purchase and actual usage during the season.  
Ensuring high quality for the intervention has been of prime importance. First, the NGO 
which executed much of the intervention and the PIs of this study have a long relationship 
through other similar interventions. Moreover, field staff were selected, trained and 
supervised by a member of our team Muhammad Ashraful Habib, who is employed by IRRI. Each survey was preceded by a full day of training and a full day of field data  
collection with the trainer. For the gas sample experiment,  additional levels of training at 
both the classroom and field levels were imparted by scientists of the Bangladesh 
Agricultural University and the International Fertilizer Development Center . 
3. Evaluation 
3.1 Primary and secondary questions  
The main evaluation questions are as follows:  
1. What is the average impact of AWD on water savings from irrigated rice?  
2. What is AWD’s impact on other input usage, such as herbicide expenditures and 
weeding labor?  
3. What is AWD’s impact on overall profitability from the plot?  
4. Does AWD have external benefits by saving water or reducing methane 
emissions from rice paddies? 
5. How do the farmer’s revealed private benefits (demand curve) compare to both 
the costs of AWD and the estimated external benefits (if any)? 
3.2 Design and Methods  
The experiment is a randomized control trial in 400 villages of Bangladesh. It is a cluster 
randomized design with a village- level treatment. In Phase 1, the villages are split 
equally into tr eatment and control groups. The number of farmers included per village is 
10, making a total sample size of 4000. The average treatment effect (ATE) of AWD was 
identified from a regression of the main outcomes on the village- level treatment indicator 
and s trata fixed effects.  5  The sample for our first RCT consists of 400 villages in Rajshahi, Rangpur, and 
Mymensingh districts of Bangladesh (134 in Rajshahi, 133 in Mymensingh, and 133 in 
Rang pur). The villages have been randomly divided into two experimental groups, with 
stratifi cation at the upazila (subdistrict) level. Figure 2  shows a map of the sample 
villages and their treatment assignment. The farmers in the 200 treatment villages have been provided with the AWD pipe, training on its use, and assistance with its installation. The farmers in the remaining 200 villages serve as a pure control.  
Figure 2: Map of treatment and control villages 
 
Source: https://ga dm.org/maps.html   
The map shows the treatment villages (in blue) and the control villages (in green). The bar chart 
embedded in the map shows the share of households (by division) where the study plot has volumetric water pricing.  
The map also demonstrates what the baseline tells us about an important component of 
our design: the frequency of volumetric water pricing across districts. Farmers in 
Rajshahi largely report paying hourly prices for pumping water and this is far less 
prevalent in the other distr icts of Rangpur and Mymensingh. We repeatedly return to this 
feature of our data in the discussion that follows.  
Figure 3 provides a diagrammatic representation of the experiment, while Figure 4  
shows a timeline of the interventions and surveys. This first phase of the study allows us 
to estimate the ATE’s of AWD across the whole population of farmers. Most importantly, 
we can estimate its impact on crop yield and the environmental benefits that come through reduced water use. Since continuously flooded rice increases CH4 emissions, 
we will quantify the effects of AWD on CH4 emissions —  by measuring CH4 emissions in 
selected treatment and control plots.  All of these effects will be identified from a 
regression of the main outcomes on the village -level treatment indicator and strata fixed 
effects. The estimates will be Intention to Treat (ITT) since we cannot guarantee that any 
farmer will maintain the AWD pipe or practice its proper use.  
6  The ratio  of prepaid irrigation cards to farmers in many villages is less than one. In some 
areas this phenomenon is extreme: the deep driver or water user’s committee in the 
village maintains a small number of prepaid cards, uses them to provide water to 
farmers, and then charges each farmer the same fee per acre. In effect, this local 
institution keeps water pricing on a per -acre basis, despite the fact that technology is in 
place for each farmer to pay for their pumping by the hour. Multiple factors may explain 
why individual card usage, and hence volumetric pricing, has not taken effect in these 
villages: it is costly and time consuming for farmers to obtain an individual card, coordination difficulties — i.e. problems in creating an efficient queueing system if each 
person is individually using a card, and concerns about fairness because some plots are far from the tube well and water is lost during transport due to the earthen canals used for conveyance. Combined with highly fragmented landholdings, this will result in 
differential prices per unit of actual water between farmers and plots as well. Our 
treatment targets the fixed costs of obtaining a card as a barrier to individual ownership.  
We first identified 144 villages in Rajshahi district — not included in the sample of our 
first RCT —  where most farmers were not using their own prepaid card for pumping. 
These villages are spread across three upazilas, two of which were included in our first 
experiment. Field staff worked with a local village leader in Novem ber 2017 to identify  25 
farmers cultivating rice during the boro season in each of these villages. The villages 
were then randomly divided into two groups. 96 were assigned to a treatment group 
where we sought to increase the share of farmers paying for ir rigation by the hour by 
using their own cards: the remaining 48 serve as a control group that retained the status 
quo of seasonal charges.  
Field teams started by organizing a meeting with these 25 farmers. These meetings  took 
place in December 2017 and ser ved four objectives. First, a short baseline questionnaire 
was administered. Second, farmers were instructed on how the irrigation system can be operated with the individual cards. Third, our field staff explained to farmers that their 
local NGO was running a program to help with applying for the prepaid card. Specifically, 
the field staff assisted each farmer in filling out the application form — including obtaining 
a passport -style photo to be printed on the card. Fourth, there is an application fee of 
150 Bangladeshi Taka (around $1.8) to be paid at the time of submitting the application. Farmers were instructed that the program would be covering these costs.  In addition, 
our partner delivered the application forms to the local upazila office of the agency 
responsible for producing the cards, collected the printed cards when they were complete, and delivered them to each treatment village prior to planting. Overall, 2,279 of 
the 2,400 (95%) farmers in the treatment group agreed to receive the cards as par t of the 
program.  
Does this effort to introduce volumetric pricing cause farmers to place greater value on 
the AWD technology? To get at this question, we conducted a revealed- preference 
demand experiment in all 144 villages. A sales person visited each of  the 25 farmers in 
January or early February 2018, depending on the planting dates in the village. S(he) gave each farmer the opportunity to purchase an AWD pipe at a randomly determined village -level price. We let the price range from 20- 90 taka. As point s of reference, the 
daily wage for casual agricultural work during the previous boro season was about 350 
taka. The estimated profit advantage of AWD was about 561 taka per plot — when 
farmers faced nonzero marginal prices for water.  Farmers who bought the  pipe were 7  required to pay cash. The pipe was handed to the farmer, along with instructions on its 
use, immediately after purchase. Unlike in the first RCT, field staff did not provide any 
further training or assistance with actually installing the AWD pipe . 
In addition to observing these purchasing decisions, and tracing out the demand curve with and without the introduction of individual volumetric water pricing, we collected data 
on whether the pipe was installed and water levels in the field. Similar to our first RCT, 
we randomly drew dates to visit each of the 144 villages. These dates were drawn to fall 
in the 10 -70 day period after planting, when we observed farmers from the first 
experiment practicing AWD. During each visit, the enumerator checked al l the plots of 
each farmer to see if an AWD pipe was being used. In addition, water levels were 
measured on the plot closest to the tube well for a random 75% of farmers and the 
farthest plot for the rest of the sample. These additional data allow us to de compose any 
treatment effects into effects on initial valuation at the time of purchase and actual usage 
during the season.  
In Phase 2, the 144 villages selected were all from Rajshahi but not part of the Phase 1 
experiment. In these villages most farmers were not using their own prepaid card for 
pumping. They are spread across three upazilas, two of which were included in our first experiment. Field staff worked with a local village leader in November 2017 to identify 25 
farmers cultivating rice during the  boro season in each of these villages. We worked with 
a village leader to identify farmers — rather than select them randomly — because our 
sample required farmers that were not using their own prepaid irrigation cards. The 
villages were then randomly div ided into two groups using a random number generator in 
Stata. 96 were assigned to a treatment group where we sought to increase the share of 
farmers paying for irrigation by the hour by using their own cards: the remaining 48 serve 
as a control group that  retained the status quo of seasonal charges.  
Field teams started by organizing a meeting with these 25 farmers. These meetings took 
place in December 2017 and served four objectives. First, a short baseline questionnaire 
was administered. Second, farmers were instructed on how the irrigation system can be 
operated with the individual cards. Third, our field staff explained to farmers that their 
local NGO was running a program to help with applying for the prepaid card. Specifically, 
the field staff assisted each farmer in filling out the application form — including obtaining 
a passport -style photo to be printed on the card. Fourth, there is an application fee of 
150 Bangladeshi Taka (around $1.8) to be paid at the time of submitting the application.  
Farme rs were instructed that the program w ould be covering these costs.  In addition, our 
partner delivered the application forms to the local upazila office of the  
agency responsible for producing the cards, collected the printed cards when they were 
complete,  and delivered them to each treatment village prior to planting. Overall, 2,279 of 
the 2,400 (95%) farmers in the treatment group agreed to receive the cards as part of the 
program.  
Our design sought to eliminate the possibility that any f uture behavior could be a func tion 
of the small 150 Taka gift to cover the application cost. Therefore, we provided each of 
the 25 farmers in the control group with 150 Taka of mobile phone credits right after 
administration of the baseline survey.  8  3.3 Ethics  
We did not encounter any ethical issues during the two phases. Farmers voluntarily 
accepted the offer to install an AWD device in their field. No problems were reported by 
the enumerators. Farmers were not required to keep the AWD pipe on their field and 
could dispose of i t as they wish.  In the second phase, farmers again voluntarily chose to 
buy the device at the offered price, and install or dispose of the pipe. The study has  been 
approved by the Institutional Review Board for Social, Behavioral, and Educational 
Research at Tufts University.

3.4 Sampling and data collect ion 
In this section we discuss the sampling and data collection. The survey instruments are 
included in online Appendix B. The 12 upazilas were selected based on local knowledge 
of IRRI Bangladesh researchers. The selection was based on two primary criteri a. First, 
the upazilas had to be in areas where rice is the dominant crop in the boro season. This 
was validated using satellite imagery of boro rice areas from IRRI. Second, the upazilas 
in Rajshahi and Rangpur districts needed to have some area covered by government 
deep tube wells.  
10  Within these upazilas, eligible villages were next identified. Villages in Rajshahi and 
Rangpur were only considered to be eligible if they have deep tube well (DTW) irrigation 
for boro rice. This effectively means that every village in the sample in these two districts 
has a government tube well run by either the Barind Multipurpose Development Authority 
(BMDA) or the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). We selected 
all villages in Mymensingh based on the census. The 400 villages in the sample were drawn randomly from the set of eligible villages.  
Within each village, enumerators went to a village leader and identified the 10 farmers that were cultivating plots close to the tube well used for irrigation. In t he event that there 
was more than one tube well, enumerators were instructed to focus on the tube well with 
the largest command area. In most cases that tube well services more than 10 farmers. 
Enumerators asked the village leader for the names of the 10 closest farmers. These 
farmers were then asked for consent to participate and in rare cases farmers that did not 
consent were replaced with the next closest farmer. These 10 farmers constitute the 
main sample for measuring the effectiveness of AWD. One limi tation is that we selected 
the farmers closest to the tube well rather than a random sample from the command 
area. It would have otherwise been prohibitively costly to collec t further data on water 
management. Nonetheless, our hypothesis on pricing incenti ves and conservation is 
meant to test a particular behavior that seems generalizable. That is, there is no reason 
to think that farmers further from the tube well would respond to incentives any differently 
than those closer. In addition to identifying the farmers, the enumerators took the GPS 
coordinates of the plots identified by the village leader, which we refer to as the study 
plots. Figure 6  gives an example of the study plots and the location of the tube well for 
one of  the villages. The farmer that manages the study plot is the respondent to our 
surveys when available. If not available, surveys are carried out with an available household member that has knowledge of management for that plot.  
For the second experiment, a similar process was followed to identify the 25 farmers in 
each village. In the 96 treatment villages, 95% of the farmers agreed to obtain the debit card.  
Figure 6: Example of study plots in one village  
 
The map shows an example of the 10 study plots for one of the experimental villages. The green 
shaded areas are the plots while the red dot is the tube well that is used to irrigate those plots.  
11  The experiment required objective measurement of water usage. However, no villages in 
our sample were equipped to measure individual -level pumping volumes. We there - fore 
designed a unique data collection strategy to observe water usage without individual 
meters. Survey teams visited each of the study plots on two randomly chosen and 
unannounced days. These visits enable us to observe whether the field was being dried 
and how much irrigation water stood in it. The random assignment of villages to days 
allows the treatment -control comparison to be made throughout the growing season. 
Having th is ability is critical because the AWD tool should not be used during the 
reproductive stage of crop growth. Hence, visiting fields on random days gives us the 
ability to verify if the tool is being properly used and whether the causal effect of AWD 
varies  by the type of water pricing. The schedule for the measurement of water 
management included 8,000 obser vations. We obtained data for 7,596 of them (95%). 
The missing observations resulted from random measurement dates falling after 
harvesting was complete d.3  
Our teams then carried out a follow -up survey in July 2017 after the boro rice crop had  
been harvested and close to the time of planting for the next rainy season. This survey 
collected information on self -reported irrigation management, input use, c rop yield, revenue, 
and profit. The data provide the basis for our calculations of profitability and treatment effects of the AWD technique on profit — both with and without volumetric pricing.  
We conducted a second RCT to estimate the causal effect of enc ouraging hourly irrigation 
prices on the valuation of water -saving technology by farmers. In Northwestern Bangladesh, 
there are 4,000 community tube wells that are equipped with meters that can take prepaid 
debit cards and release irrigation water. Farmers  can load their own cards with funds at a 
nearby kiosk and obtain irrigation water on demand. This solution is low -cost, implementable 
and aligns incentives for efficient water use. Our treatment seeks to increase the penetration 
of prepaid card usage in order to examine the causal link between pricing policy and 
technology adoption and to test a scalable solution for implementing volumetric pricing.
4  
We identified 144 villages which have installed meters, but use of prepaid cards by individual farmers is almost non -existent.
5 In order to encourage hourly pricing for water, 
we randomly selected 96 villages for a campaign to assist farmers in obtaining their own 
debit cards. Many farmers attribute the low rate of individual card ownership to the costs 
                                                
3 Harvesting dates were estimated from information on planting dates and length of the growing 
cycle from the baseline survey. This is obviously an imperfect proxy for current -year harvesting 
dates and there-  fore explains why the data are missing for a small number of cases. Missing data 
due to this scheduling issue is balanced across treatment and control groups.  
4 It is scalable because the policymaker only needs to provide farmers with payment cards and 
install a single meter at each pump, rather than individual meters for each plot.  
5 In most cases the tube well operator maintains a few cards, manages the allocation of water to 
farmers, and provides them with equal per -acre bills regardless of their individual consumption. 
The bills are most often paid in two installments: at the beginning and end of the season. One of 
the main benefits of this approach — from the perspective of the tube well operator — is the ease 
of tracking. The operator only needs to observe how much money is being used on his cards and 
acreage cultivated by each farmer, rather than keep track of the individual hours pumped. The 
operator levies a markup before calculating the per -acre cost to be charged to each farmer. The 
per-acre charge makes it easi er to conceal this markup: the per hour cost of pumping is generally 
known to farmers.  12  associ ated with the application process. Our treatment sought to reduce these costs by 
organizing a meeting with farmers to explain the purpose of the prepaid cards, help them 
fill out the paper application, obtain the photograph needed, pay the application fee of  
$1.9, deliver the forms to the irrigation authority, pick up the cards once complete, and deliver them to farmers. Once in hand, a farmer can load the card with funds —  the 
same way as a mobile phone — and purchase water from the village tube well.  
This nudge towards hourly water pricing changes how farmers value water -saving 
technology. We estimate the demand curve for AWD by sending sales teams to all 
villages and offering farmers an AWD pipe at a randomly determined village -level price, 
along with inf ormation on its use. The eight different random prices ranged from 15 to 
70% of the marginal cost of the pipe.
 
4. Findings  
4.1 Intervention implementation fidelity  
The original plan was to estimate the demand for the AWD device in Phase 2. In the final phase 3 of  the proposal, we had planned to focus on understanding whether subsidies 
for AWD can be precisely targeted. The plan was to return to the 120 control villages from Phase 1 and offer AWD at subsidized prices to farmers that were not part of Phase 1. In 60 randomly chosen villages we would set a uniform subsidy at a level determined 
by our Phase 2 analysis. These villages would be compared with the other 60 villages 
where we customize the subsidy offer based on the farmer’s elicited discount rate 
(elicited a fter Phase 1 with an incentivized choice experiment). Comparing uptake 
across these villages would be informative of whether subsidies for conserving water are 
more effective when we use simple economic theory to optimally set their levels for 
different fa rmers.  
Since the Phase 1 results suggested that the existence of the marginal price for water was a critical factor that affected the benefits from AWD, in Phase 2, we now conduct the debit card encouragement first, followed by the demand elicitation exper iment in the 
same treament and control villages. This revised experiment in Phase 2 allowed us to estimate the causal effect of debit card possession on the demand for AWD. We believe that this correction was a marked improvement from the original plan.  
During our implementation of the first phase, and interaction with farmers during sev eral 
visits and organized village meetings, it became clear to us that discount rates may have 
little to do with the uptake of the AWD. Other factor s had a larger and more i mmedi ate 
role in affecting the performance of the AWD technology, such as the marginal price of 
water and spillover effects relating to water distribution within the village. Clusters of 
farmers located in close proximity within the command area of the tubewell may receive 
irrigation water at the same time, and adoption decisions may be related to specific 
farmer characteristics such as location of farmers in relation to the  distribution system 
and gradi ent of the field. For example, if a cluster of farms r eceive water during the same 
irrigation  cycle because they are close to each other, a single farmer may not adopt the 
AWD device because his irrigation schedule may now diverge from his neighbors.  
 13  The phase 2 experiment was carried out in new villages and  only in Rajshahi district 
where tubewells are equipped with meters that can accept debit cards. The details of the 
experiment are described elsewhere and not repeated here.  
We made sure that the interventions were consistent across the two experiments. T he 
training given by enumerators was effective –  this is clearly observed from the water use 
shown in Fig 7. Farmers were asked to not use the pipe during flowering, and that is 
exactly what we observe around the 70 day mark. Evidence that the pipes were i nstalled 
was obtained through photographs of the pipe in the farmer’s plot taken when the 
enumerator visited for water measurements. In RCT 2, cards were distributed to farmers and we recorded the names of the farmers with their card numbers. That ensured that 
these farmers received the cards.  
5. Impact Analysis 
5.1 Descriptive statistics and balance tables  
In Table 1, we show the summary statistics for baseline variables. Baseline covariates 
are well balanced across treatment arms. Table 2 shows mean values of baseline char - 
acteristics in addition to p- values from regressions of each characteristic on treatment 
and strata fixed effects. We report balance for the covariates which were previously used to describe the sample. Only one of the 19 characteristics tested is significantly different 
between treatment and control arms at the 10% level.  
Our pre -analysis plan contains several tests of heterogeneous treatment effects as a 
function of whether the wat er price is linked to usage. Most of the variation is across 
upazilas. This combined with our treatment assignment being stratified by upazila helps 
balance the random ization within pricing regimes.  Table 3 verifies this. Foc using on the 
sample with volumetric prices, two of the 18 characteristics are significantly different 
between treatment and control households.  
In combination, the randomization succeeded at generating comparable treatment and 
control groups both for the w hole sample and within the sample where incentives align 
for AWD adoption. Our simple regressions of the main outcomes on treatment and strata fixed effects will therefore generate estimate treatment effects that are internally valid   
for our sample. Our pre -analysis plan also includes regressions that control for these 
baseline characteristics. However, these findings suggest that the estimated effects are 
likely to change little when including these controls.  
Table 3 shows baseline characteristics for the treatment and control groups in the 
second RCT and Table 4 shows covariate balance. Household and farm characteristics 
are generally similar across the two groups. Household size is the only characteristic not 
balanced across treatment and con-  trol villages.
 The average farmer in this sample pays 
around 1500 taka (approximately  $18) to irrigate one bigah of land (a bigah equals one-
third of an acre). 70% pay this money directly to the deep driver as a per -bigah fee. The 
remaining 30% pay the fee to a wat er users committee.   
 
 14  5.2 Effect on water use  
Our pre -analysis plan (online Appendix C) guides the impact analysis. We use the first -
year experiment to estimate the causal impact of AWD technology on water 
management, input costs, and agricultural profits.  
Table 1: Summary statistics of household demographic variables  
 
The table shows mean values and standard deviations of baseline demographic variables for all 
4,000 households in the sample. Column 1 shows statistics for the entire sample, while Columns 
2-4 show separate summary statistics for the three districts. Age and years of education are for 
the survey respondent, which is the decision maker on the study plot if that person was available. 
The baseline was administered to decision maker for the study plot for 78% of respondents.

The table shows mean values of each baseline characteristic and standard deviations for control 
(Column 1) and treatment (Column 2) farmers. Column 3 gives the p- value from a regression of

clustered at the village level.

The table shows mean values of baseline characteristics for farmers in the 48 control (column 1) 
and 96 prepaid- card treatment villages (column 2). Standard deviations are displayed below each 
mean value in parentheses . Column 3 shows the p- value from the regression of each 
characteristic on the treatment indicator and strata (Upazila) fixed effects. The data are based on the baseline survey carried out with 25 farmers per village during December 2017.  
  
17  Table 4: Covariate balance across treatment arms for sam ple of households with 
volumetric pricing  
 
Data are only for the 1,388 households that report volumetric water pricing at baseline. The table 
shows mean values of each baseline characteristi c and standard deviations for control (Column 
1) and treatment (Column 2) farmers. Column 3 gives the p- value from a regression of the 
characteristic on treatment and strata (upazila) fixed effects, where standard errors are clustered 
at the village level.  
18  Our preferred specification is therefore,  
yivs = β0 +β1Treatmentv +β2Volumetricivs +β3Treatmentv ∗Volumetricivs +αs +εivs, (1) 
where yivs is the observed outcome for farmer i in village v and upazila s. The treat ment 
indicator, Treatmentv , varies only at the village level. The indicator for volumetric pr icing 
varies mostly across upazilas, but can occasionally vary within these strata.6 We 
estimate equation (1) for the sample of 4,000 study plots, regardless of whether the 
farmer kept the AWD pipe in that field, chose to move it elsewhere, or removed it entirely 
— all of which happened rarely. We report both these heterogeneous effects and the 
average treatment effect.  
The average effect of AWD on water management —  across the entire sample —  is both 
small and statistically insignificant. Table 4  shows in column 1 that the average study plot 
in treatment villages had only 0.06 cm less water standing in the field. Increased uptake 
of the AWD practice should increase the likelihood that study plots of treatment farmers are being dried, i.e. have no standing water in the field. Column 2 shows that the treatment increases the effect on drying by about 1.9 percentage points — or about 4% 
— but this average effect is noisy . It is also clear that farmers practice some form of the 
AWD technique without using PVC pipes: fields in the control group were dry 45% of the 
time. Thus, the correct counterfactual for AWD differs from the one used in agronomic 
experiments where water i s maintained in the control field for the entire season.
7  
5.3 Heterogeneity of impacts  
We found significant heterogeneity of impacts between farmers who pay a fixed charge 
for water and those who pay be the volume of water used. As discussed earlier, the 
wate r savings were significant for those who paid volumetric prices.  
Table 4 shows that AWD is only effective for farmers who face volumetric water prices. 
In column 3, AWD generates an effect on water levels only for farmers fac ing nonzero 
marginal prices. Introducing AWD in places with volumetric pricing lowers the amount of 
observed irrigation water by 0.43 centimeters, or an 18% decrease. The probability of a 
plot being dry also increases by 8.4 percentage points (19%). Finall y, the third row of the 
table shows that the correlation between volumetric pricing and water use (within strata) 
is small and statistically insignificant. This result could be driven by either the limited 
variation within strata, or correlation between unobservables and volumetric pricing.8 
                                                
6 Upazila fixed effects explain 77% of the variation in the indicator variable for volumetric pricing. 
The remaining variation within upazilas is largely due to three factors: 1) some villages in 
Mymensingh have a system where the tube well owner collects payment for the fuel used in 
pumping, while other nearby villages do not, 2) a few villages in Rajshahi did not have the prepaid card system for irrigation and 3) the tube well owner (who always faces a nonzero marginal price) may be part of the sample in Mymensingh villages.  
7 Agronomic experiments generally compare AWD to “continuous flooding.” This is a system 
where the farmer never lets the field go dry. The field is re -irrigated when water reaches a low 
level, but before evaporating entirely.  
8 The volumetric pricing indicator has a negative correlation with water levels and a positive 
correlation with the probability of fields being dried when dropping strata fixed effects and 
therefore using variation across upazilas.  19  Table 5: Effects of AWD treatment on water usage 
 
The data are from random unannounced visits to the study plots of sample farmers during the 
2017 boro (dry) growi ng season. The dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 is the amount of 
standing water in the field, measured in centimeters. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 4 is an indicator variable for a dry field with no standing water. Volumetric pricing is an indicator for 
farmers for whom the water price is tied to usage, either through hourly charges or fuel payments. 
Standard errors are clustered at the village level. Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically 
significant at the 1% 
∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ levels.  
Combining these findings, Figure 7 demonstrates how the effectiveness of AWD varied 
both across time and by type of water pricing. It shows nonparametric regressions of water 
levels (top panel) and the indicator for dry fields (middle panel) on days after planting, 
separately for treatment and control villages. The upper left panel shows that AWD caused 
a decrease in irrigation withdrawals during the pre -flowering period of crop growth — but 
only for farmers paying for water on the margin. The same estimates in the upper right 
panel establish that AWD had no impact on measured water levels for farmers facing seasonal charges. The middle panel shows a similar pattern with dry fields: we observe that introducing AWD leads to a noticeable increas e in drying in places with vol umetric 
pricing during the early part of the growing season, but no changes are observed for the two thirds of farmers that pay for water on a seasonal basis. The figure also helps  
visualize how farmers conserve water when facing volumetric prices, even without AWD.
 
Namely, farmers tend to keep fields dry after flowering, regardless of whether they are using AWD pipes.  
Table 5 shows the exact magnitude of these impacts. Under volumetric pricing, AWD 
causes water levels to be lower by 0.83 cm (31%) and leads to a 17.3 percentage point 
increase in the occurrence of dry fields (54%) during the first 70 days of the growing 
season. In contrast, the effect of  AWD during this time is close to zero and statistically 
insignificant for farmers facing seasonal contracts. Columns 3 and 4 verify the visual 
results that plots of treatment farmers were managed in the same fashion as those of the 
control group after the  first 70 days of the growing season, regardless of the type of 
water contract. These results are insensitive to the choice of splitting the sample using a 
threshold of 70 days: we show in Tables 6  and 7 that results are similar when we divide 
the season using a 60 or 80 day cutoff.  
20  Table 6: Heterogeneous effects by first 70 days of the growing season 
 
The data are from random unannounced visits to the study plots of sample farmers during the 
2017 boro (dry) growing season. Columns 1 and 2 are for measurements taken up to 70 days 
after transplanting.  
Columns 3 and 4 are for measurements taken more than 70 days after transplanting. The 
dependent variable in columns 1 and 3 is the amount of standing water in the field, measured in 
centimeters. The dependent variable in columns 2 and 4 is an indicator variable for a dry field with no standing water.  
Volumetric pricing is an indicator for farmers for whom the water price is tied to usage, either through hourly charges or payments for diesel fuel. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% 
∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗ levels.  
Our estimates line up with f indings from agronomic trials only when prices are set 
volumetrically. Figure 8  shows 87 impact estimates reported in 26 different agronomic 
studies. The estimated water savings from these experiments range from 5 to 65%, wit h 
median savings of 27%. Our 19.2% effect on water levels when prices are volumetric — 
from Table 4 column 3 — falls right at the 25th percentile of the agronomic estimates.    
In contrast, the null effect with area -based pri cing is outside the range of estimates from 
agronomic trials. The failure of markets to efficiently price water appears to be a critical 
factor causing the field- based RCT estimates to deviate from those in the laboratory.  
Our post -harvest follow up survey  included a module on irrigation management. Using 
these data, column 1 in Table 8  shows that farmers given AWD report 3.6 fewer 
irrigations, which amounts to a 19% impact since the average plot in the control group 
was irrig ated about 19 times, or once every 5- 6 days. Yet, all treatment farmers report 
irrigating their fields less, regardless of whether their village has volumet ric pricing 
(column 2). Experi menter demand effects offer a reasonable explanation for this finding:  
treatment farmers knew that practicing AWD reduces the number of irrigations and 
responded accordingly  — even if they did not practice AWD as recommended. Turning 
to columns 3 and 4, treatment farmers report 2.2 additional drainages, which 
corresponds to a 91% increase relative to the control group. This effect is significantly 
larger for farmers in villages with volumetric pricing, as shown in column 4.

5.4 Effect on costs and profits  
Adoption of AWD only increases profit when water is priced at the margin.9 Column 1 in 
Table 9 shows that the causal effect of AWD on profits per acre, in the absence of 
volumetric pricing, is close to zero and statistically insignificant. In contrast, the AWD 
technology increases profits by approximately 1,870 taka (about $23) per acre, or about 
7%, when water has a marginal price. Columns 2- 4 decompose the effect, showing that 
the overall effect on profitability comes from lower water costs and higher revenues,  not 
increases in yield.10 Columns 5- 8 report similar results when all outcomes are measured 
in logs rather than levels. In Tables 10  and 11 we provide a breakdown of the effect of 
the treatment on material and labor expenditures.  
Overall, AWD leads to positive returns only when water is priced at the margin. This 
conclusion is robust to trimming outliers in the profit distribution, controlling for a broad 
                                                
9 We measure revenue per acre by dividing the total output from the plot by plot size to obtain 
yield, regardless of how much of the output was sold or kept for consumption.  We then multiply 
the yield by   the output price for the 98.5% of farmers that reported selling output. We use the 
average sale price for the remaining 1.5% of farmers that did not sell any output. We collected input expenditures for fertilizer, pesticide, herbicide, water, planting labor, weeding labor, and 
harvesting labor. Labor inputs included both family labor and hired labor. We valued family labor 
by multiplying the number of person days by the daily wage rate from the survey.  
10 The fact that AWD leaves yield unchanged is cons istent with agronomic experiments (Belder et 
al., 2004;  Yao et al.,  2012).  The positive — although insignificant — effect on revenue is therefore 
driven by higher prices. AWD leading to higher output prices is consistent with a claim sometimes 
made that periodic drying of fields improves grain quality.  
24  set of bas eline covariates, and interacting those covariates with treatment. Consistent 
with the survey estimates, we also find no difference in satellite- measured greenness 
between treatment and control plots. Despite using less water, the plots of treatment 
farmer s appear no less green. We also find evidence that treatment effects on adoption 
and water usage persist for another year after the experiment.11  
Finally, we find that within Rajshahi district — where prepaid pumps allow water to be 
priced by the hour —  some farmers do not have their own prepaid cards.12 Instead, 
farmers rely on the deep driver (tubewell operator) to use his card and then charge them 
a fixed seasonal price. This charge is a function only of acreage cultivated, and not the number of hours of pumping. The deep driver essentially averages out the total pumping 
cost over the entire command area and bills farmers accordingly. This local institution 
provides additional heterogeneity. In particular, the profits from AW D should be higher 
for farmers that hold their own cards and thus stand to gain by pumping less 
groundwater. We test this idea in the study villages in Rajshahi.
13 
Column 1 of Table 12  shows that  AWD lowers water costs by about 931 taka —  or 17% 
— for cardholders and has no effect for farmers that pay the deep driver for water. The 
effect on profits and log profits in columns 2 and 3 is noisier, but goes in the same direction. AWD increases profit  by 11 to 12% for farmers with cards, but it has a smaller 
effect in villages where individual card ownership is absent. The system where farmers hold their own prepaid cards and pay for water by the hour is however not randomly 
assigned.
14 The observed het erogeneity could therefore result from factors correlated 
with card ownership, rather than card ownership itself. Columns 4 through 6 test whether 
the interaction effects are sensitive to interacting the AWD treatment indicator with a 
large set of baseline characteristics. The interaction effects between the AWD treatment 
and having an individual prepaid card remain similar —  and actually increase —  when 
allowing for the impact of AWD to also depend on observable characteristics. The evidence further points  to inefficient water pricing as a barrier to AWD uptake.  
                                                
11 We consider the persiste nce of treatment effects over time by using a subsample of villages 
where we elicit demand in the same way as in the second RCT, described later in the paper.  In 
particular, farmers in 112 randomly selected treatment villages and 56 randomly selected cont rol 
villages were offered an AWD pipe for the 2018 season at one of eight random prices. These 
offers took place in both treatment and control villages, but Table ?? shows that initial treatment 
farmers were still 70% more likely to be using AWD — on any plot — during the 2018 season. 
Using water measurements from one of those plots, treatment plots had 17% less water and were 
39% more likely to be dry. Measurements were taken on the plot closest to the village tube well 
for a random 75% of farmers and the farthest plot for the remaining 25%. We see that the 
treatment effect on second- year adoption is larger amongst farmers with volumetric prices, but the 
interaction term is imprecisely estimated. We do not find heterogeneity in this “first -stage” 
relationsh ip for the specific plot where enumerators measured water levels.  
12 Our baseline survey, and hence the analysis until this point, classified these farmers as paying 
volumet ric prices because their village already had a prepaid pump installed.  
13 We did not know about this heterogeneity at the time of designing the study. Therefore, these 
estimates were not pre- specified in our analysis plan.  
14 Farmers who have their own cards are older, have larger households, own more livestock, are 
less likely to own their  own private tube well, and report irrigating their field more often during the 
boro season at baseline.  25  Table 9: Effects on self -reported water use  
 
The data are taken from the followup survey after harvesting. The dependent variables are the

The data are from the follow up survey and are limited to the Rajshahi district where some 
farmers have their own prepaid irrigation card to pay for water by the hour. The variable “Has 
Card” is an indicator variable for farmers that report having their own prepaid card. The dependent variables are the cost of water per acre (columns 1 and 4), profit per acre (columns 2 and 5), and log prof it per acre (columns 3 and 6). Columns 4- 6 include demeaned farmer 
covariates from baseline and interactions between these demeaned covariates and the AWD 
treatment indicator. The covariates included are all of those in Table?? (age, years of education, 
household size, number of livestock owned, landholdings, television ownership, refrigerator 
ownership, tube well ownership, indicator for knowledge of AWD, indicator for a rented or

levels.  
5.5 Effect on demand for AWD  
Our findings until this point suggest that lack of a marginal price for water creates a dis - 
incentive for the adoption of water -conserving technology. But the findings from the first 
RCT do not allow us to firmly rule out that unobservables correlated with the existence of 
nonzero marginal prices drive the heterogeneous impact of AWD. With this limitation in 
mind, we designed the phase 2 experiment to randomly facilitate volumetric pricing and 
measure its effect on demand for AWD. This section discusses the timing of events and 
results for the debit card experiment.  
We now show some descriptive “first stage” evidence that some farmers did use the 
prepaid cards. The experiment was carried out in three upazilas, one of which provided us complete data on card usage for the 800 treatment farmers. We found that 40.3% of 
them (323) loaded their card at least once during the period from January 12th to August 
7th, 2018. The median farmer — conditional on loading at least once —  spent 3,000 taka 
($37.5 or the equivalent of irrigating about 2 plots with seasonal charges) and loaded the 
card five times. These distributions have a substantial right tail: a farmer at the 90th 
percentile reloaded the card 22 times and  spent 21,800 taka (Figure 9). 28  Figure 9: Densities of number recharges and amount spent for farmers using 
prepaid cards  
 
Notes: The figure is for farmers in the one upazila (Paba) that provided us wi th usage data on the 
prepaid cards. Both graphs are for the 323 farmers that used the card. The left panel shows the 
density of the number of times the card was recharged, while the right figure shows the density of 
the total amount spent (in taka).  
Does t he demand curve for AWD change when farmers are encouraged to pay for water 
by the hour of pumping? To answer this question, we combine the random variation in 
village -level AWD prices with the random encouragement of prepaid card usage. The 
main specifica tion is,  
Adoptionivs = β0 + β1Cardvs + β2P ricevs + β3Cardvs ∗ P ricevs + αs + εivs,  (2) 
where Adoptionivs is an indicator for whether farmer i purchased the AWD pipe, Cardvs 
equals one if village v in upazila s is one of the 96 prepaid card villages, and P ricevs is 
the random AWD price offered in the village. As in our previous analysis, standard errors 
continue to be clustered at the village level.  
Figure 10 shows the fitted demand estimates from (2) as lines with t he raw adoption rates 
as dots. Shifting farmers to hourly charges reduces price sensitivity for AWD. Our lower 
prices result in high take up rates and no statistical difference between the prepaid card 
treatment and control. About 65% of farmers in the control group purchased pipes at the lowest four prices: this rate remains roughly the same in treatment villages. In contrast, 
introducing hourly irrigation cards caused AWD demand to increase at higher prices. Only 
21% of farmers in the control group purchased pipes when priced at 60 taka or higher. Hourly pricing increased purchases by approximately 35% at these four higher prices.  
The take- up rate of the device depends on the randomized price offered in the village and 
whether farmers were treatment or con trol. As shown in Figure 10  , the share of farmers 
purchasing the device was ranged from 60- 80% at lower prices and about 20% at the highest 
prices offered. The take- up was significantly higher at higher prices for treatment farmers.  
Two additional results are apparent in Figure 10.  First, demand is elastic. The demand 
elasticity in the control group is about 1.7 at the midpoint price of 55 taka. Delta-  method 
standard errors lead to a rejection of unit elastic demand in the control. This result is 
consistent with the common finding that demand  for improved technology in developing 
29  countries is highly price sensitive — even for technologies proven beneficial. As 
examples, experimental estimates of  demand show high sensitivity to prices for health 
technologies in Kenya (Kremer and Miguel,  2007;  Dupas,  2014b)  and crop insurance in 
Ghana (Karlan et al.,  2014).  This demand elasticity suggests that even modest subsidies 
have the potential to induce large increases in the demand for AWD.  
Figure 10: Demand curve by volumetric pricing treatment  
 
Notes: Figure shows linear demand estimates for farmers in the 144 villages that were part of the 
second- year experiment. The blue dots are raw adoption rates for the 96 treatment villages where 
prepaid hourly irrigation cards were provided. The blue line is the linear demand estimate for 
treatment villages.  
The grey dots are adoption rates in the 48 control villages and the grey line presents the corresponding linear demand estimate. Asterisks denote that the marginal impact of the treatment (from the linear demand estimates) is statistically significant (1% 
∗∗∗ , 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗). The 
estimation sample includes all 25 farmers in each village.  
Second, willingness to pay for AWD is low when compared to both the profitability of the 
technology and the estimated marginal production cost. In the first experiment, AWD with 
volumetric pricing increases profits by about 1,870 taka per acre. The median plot in our 
first-year sample is 0.3 acres, implying that using an AWD pipe on a single plot increases 
profits by about 561 taka — a value well above what farmers are wi lling to pay. We 
estimate the marginal cost of AWD production to be 133 taka — based on surveys 
conducted with 10 engineering shops.15 Our findings show no demand at this price, even 
after promoting hourly pricing for water. However, the socially optimal pr ice of AWD 
depends on its external benefits. These may include reduced greenhouse gas emissions from electricity, reduced methane emissions from rice fields, and the social benefit of the 
groundwater not extracted and available to others, discussed later i n this report.  
Table 14 shows the corresponding regression results. Column 1 gives the average 
treatment effect across all price levels. The irrigation card treatment led to an increase in 
the AWD purchasing rate by about 4.3 percentage points, or roughly 10%. The aver - age 
effect is indistinguishable from zero due to the significant heterogeneity across price 
                                                
15 Field staff visited each shop in June 2018 and asked the owner for a quote to produce two 
different ran-  domly selected quantities of AWD pipes. Regr essing the estimated quotes on 
quantity delivers a coefficient of 133 taka.  
30  levels. Column 2 provides the main estimates corresponding to the specification in (2). 
Demand for water -saving technology is less responsive to price in villages where we 
introduce hourly irrigation cards. Increasing the price by 1 taka leads to a 1.29 
percentage point decrease in adoption without volumetric pricing. This price 
responsiveness falls significantly by 0.34 percentage points when we facilitate volumetric 
pricing. The demand elasticity at a price of 55 taka — reported at the bottom of column 2 
— falls by 33% from  1.7 to 1.14 with the prepaid card treatment. This difference in 
elasticities is statistically significant at the 1% level.16 We also pre- specified a functional 
form wher e prices are measured in logs. Columns 3 and 4 show that this additional 
specification gives similar results. Overall, introducing a pricing mechanism that  puts a 
marginal price on water increases farmers willingness to pay for water -conserving 
technology.  
The estimated demand curves can be used to calculate the gain in consumer surplus that results from encouraging volumetric prices.  Figure 11 shows the percentage in-  crease in 
consumer surplus between farmers with and without hourly irrigation cards. For instance, 
when priced at 55 taka — the median price in our demand experiment — nudging farmers 
to adopt volumetric pricing c auses consumer surplus  from AWD to increase by almost 
64%. These gains in consumer surplus are largest at higher prices, as seen in Figure 10.

The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample consists 
of 25 farmers per village. The dependent variable in all regressions is an indicator if the farmer 
purchased the AWD pipe at the randomly set price. Prices were set randomly at the village level and range from 20 to 90 taka (around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric treatment variable is an indicator for 
villages where the 25 farmers were provided assistance with filling out the a pplication for a prepaid 
(hourly) irrigation card and a waiver of the 150 taka sign- up fee. The p- value for equal elasticities is 
based on standard errors from the delta method. Standard errors are clustered at the village level.

16 We rely on delta- method standard errors for this statistical test since the elasticities (and their 
difference) are a non- linear function of the parameter estimates.

Notes: The figure shows the gain in consumer surplus (of AWD) from the prepaid card treatment 
(measured in %) as black dots.  The black dots are the percentage difference between the two 
surpluses at various prices p . The 90% confidence intervals (whiskers) are estimated from 1,000 
bootstrapped samples where the range of each whisker shows the 5th to 95th percentiles of the 
distribution of percentage changes in consumer surplus.  
The intervention in our first experiment included assistance with installing the AWD pipe. 
Providing farmers with the AWD tool, some basic training, and installation sup-  port led 
to reduced water use and increased profitability for farmers paying for water by the hour. 
The large gap between purchasing and using AWD in the second experiment highlights the importance of basic training and installation support to ensure that the full benefits of 
AWD are realized.
17 
Figure 12 shows that despite the low rate of installation, the unconditional price- usage 
relationship remains steeper in prepaid- card villages. The dashed lines in the figure 
show usage (installation), while the solid lines show the demand curves (purchasing).  
The number of treatment farmers buying AWD pipes ranges from about 260 at a price of 
20 taka to a round 70 at a price of 90 taka.  The average num ber of users across all the 9 
price points is around 25. At prices above 60 taka, only 1.4% of farmers installed AWD in 
control villages. Approximately 7.4% did so in treatment villages. The regression 
estimates in Table 16 provide exact magnitudes. In column 1, increasing price by one 
taka (about 1.8% of the midpoint price of 55 taka) causes a decrease in the usage rate 
by 0.16 percentage points, or 2.3% of the mean usage rate amongst control villages. 
Column 2 again shows the heterogeneity in price responsiveness. A one taka price 
increase causes a decrease in adoption by 0.33 percentage points in control villages and 0.10 percentage points in treatment villages. While the interaction term is not quite statisti cally significant (p=0.135), the point estimate shows that around two thirds of the 
price responsiveness in control villages is eliminated when introducing hourly pricing. 
                                                
17 We also measured water levels on a single plot per farmer. Table 15 shows that the interaction 
between price and the volumetric treatment does not have a positive coefficient for these specific 
plots. This lack of a “first -stage” relat ionship may explain why we do not observe any effect on 
water management on these plots.  
32  The estimated elasticities at the bottom of the table make this clear. The price- usage 
elasticity in control villages  is 2.58 and this falls by over 75% to 0.6 in treatment vi llages. 
The difference between the two elasticities is highly significant. Columns 3- 4 
demonstrate that similar result s are obtained with log prices.  
The difference in elasticities appears to result from how the prepaid cards change the 
screening ability of prices. Among farmers who purchased an AWD pipe, the correlation 
between price and usage is significantly larger in prepaid card villages. In fact, the price-
usage  correlation is negative in control villages and weakly positive in pre-  paid card 
villages. Screening offers one potential explanation. The prepaid cards put a marginal price on water. Realizing this, farmers carefully evaluate the merits of the AWD pipe.  The 
farmers induced to buy the AWD pipe at higher prices are those that value them most 
and are the ones most likely to install. In contrast, prices for conservation technol ogy do 
not screen effectively in the absence of volumetric water pricing because f armers stand 
to gain little from using the pipe for irrigation.

management on one field per farmer   
 
The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample 
consists of 25 farmers per village. The data are for one plot per farmer. The chosen plot is the 
closest to the village tube well for 75% of random farmers and the furthest plot for the remaining 
25% of farmers. Prices were set randomly at the village level and range from 20 to 90 taka 
(around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric treatment variable is an indicator for villages where the 25 
farmers were provided assistance with filling out the application for a prepaid (hourl y) irrigation 
card and a waiver of the 150 taka sign- up fee. Standard errors are clustered at the village level. 
Asterisks indicate that coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% ∗∗∗, 5% ∗∗, and 10% ∗

Notes: The figure shows the demand curves for AWD as solid lines, where uptake is measured as 
purchasing the pipe from the door -to-door salesperson. The solid lines merely replicate the 
demand c urves from Figure 10.  The dashed lines instead consider usage, where usage is defined 
as an enumerator being able to verify that an AWD pipe was installed in one of the farmer’s fields. 
The blue lines are for farmers in the 96 treatment villages where prepaid hourly irrigation cards

The data are from the 144 villages that were part of the second- year experiment. The sample 
consists of 25 farmers per village. The dependent variable in all regressions is an indicator equal to one if it was verified that the farmer installed AWD on one of their plots. Prices were set 
randomly at the village le vel and range from 20 to 90 taka (around $0.24 to $1.1). The volumetric 
treatment variable is an indicator for villages where the 25 farmers were provided assistance with 
filling out the application for a prepaid (hourly) irrigation card and a waiver of th e 150 taka sign- up

34  6. Estimating the benefits of the technology  
We also try to briefly consider the environmental benefits of AWD. First, AWD reduces 
groundwater extraction which lowers electricity demand and therefore greenhouse gas 
emissions from  electricity generation. Ideally, electricity should be priced at its marginal 
social cost, which would include the negative externalities from electricity generation. However, taxing electricity has proven to be elusive in practice. In the absence of a 
socially optimal electricity price, subsidizing energy efficiency is a second -best 
alternative to reducing these externalities.  
We quantify one part of such a subsidy for AWD by approximating the dollar value of 
reduced carbon emissions from an installed AWD  device. We base our estimate on both 
the results from the experiment and additional data we collected for this purpose. The 
remainder of the section describes the different steps of this computation.  
Reduced groundwater pumping: We do not have survey meas ures of pumping hours 
to compare treatment and control farmers from our first experiment. However, col - umn 1 
in Table 12  finds that AWD reduces water costs by 931.1 taka per acre for farmers with 
hourly irrigation cards. The median plot size is 0.3 acres and the cost per hour of 
pumping is 120 taka. Combining these three figures delivers an estimated savings of 2.3 hours of pumping per AWD device.  
Electricity consumption per hour of pumping: We sent enumerators to 26 random 
villages in March/April 2018 to observe electricity usage by monitoring electric meters 
during tube well operation. We use the starting and ending time of operation, combined 
with electricity consumption, to estimate an electricity usage of 18.1 kilowatt hours (kwh) per hour of operation. As a benchmark, annual household electricity consumption per 
capita in Bangladesh is about 300 kwh.  
Electricity produced per unit of consumption: The ratio of electricity produced to  
consumed in Bangladesh is 1.14. We adjus t this number to allow for 75% of the trans - 
mission losses to be attributed to electricity flowing through power lines, while the other 
25% are fixed and independent of consumption. We therefore end up with 1.105 kwh of 
production needed per kwh of consum ption.  
Marginal CO
2 emissions from electricity production in Bangladesh : A reduction in 
electricity demand for irrigation reduces CO 2 emissions from generating electricity. 
Marginal CO 2 emissions from electricity depend on a number of factors, including the 
type of fuel and the efficiency of power plants. Ideally, we need data from Bangladesh 
power plants with repeated observations on plant load and emissions. Without this data 
for Bangladesh, we instead use annual panel data from about 3,900 U.S. power plants to 
estimate marginal CO 2 emissions as a function of fuel type and thermal efficiency of the 
plant. We then obtain these two characteristics (fuel type and efficiency) for the universe 
of Bangladesh power plants and estimate marginal emissions per plant  using the 
regres sion estimates from U.S. plants. We take the average of plant -level marginal 
emissions where each plant is weighted by its share of annual electricity generation for 
the whole country.  
This approach delivers a marginal emissions rate of 1. 4 lbs of CO 2 per kwh of electricity. 
This number is roughly on par with CO 2 emissions generated by the electricity grid in the 35  eastern United States. The estimate is also similar to the grid emission factor released 
by the Bangladesh Department of Environm ent in 2014 (1.47 lbs per kwh).  
Social cost of carbon: We use the standard estimate of 31 US$ per ton of CO 2. 
Combining these figures, the estimated one- year benefit of AWD on a single rice plot  — 
due to reduced carbon emissions from electricity — is 79.91 taka. This annual benefit 
represents about 60% of the marginal cost of production. Moreover, these are not the 
only external benefits of AWD. Agronomic studies find that adopting AWD lowers 
methane emissions  from rice by approximately 50% . We attempted to measure 
methane gas on a sample of 104 plots from the first experiment. A malfunction in our 
partner’s gas chromatograph delayed analysis of the samples and made these results 
unreliable.  
An additional social benefit of AWD is in valuing the groundwater t hat is not pumped, and 
remains in the aquifer for future use, which delivers benefits to other farmers relying on 
the same groundwater source. To approximate these benefits, we first need to compute 
the volume of water saved by AWD. The calculations above suggest that AWD reduces pumping times by 2.3 hours per plot. The standard government deep tube well has a 
capacity of 1 cusec, i.e. 1 ft 3/sec or 101.941 m 3/hr. Thus, a reasonable estimate of 
averted pumping by using AWD on a single plot is 234.46 m 3 or 0. 19 acre feet of water. 
Column 3 of Table 4  shows water savings of about 18.3%, suggesting total water use of 
1.04 acre feet for the rice plots in our sample. A conservative agronomic estimate of the 
return flow for rice is 25 %. That is, 25% of the averted pumping caused by AWD is water 
that would have returned to the aquifer anyway. Thus, an estimate of the true water 
savings from AWD is 75% of the averted pumping, or 0.1425 acre-ft. This volume of 
water is not trivial. It represents about half of the mean annual household residential 
consumption in the United States.  
What is the value of this conserved groundwater? The average value of water in rice 
farming in our sample can be obtained by multiplying the profit per acre from column 1 of 
Table 9 (which is 27,133 taka) by plot size (0.3 acres) and dividing by total water use 
(1.04 acre -ft) which gives 7,827 taka per acre- ft of water. This is approximately $93 per 
acre- ft, which is high for a developing country, but shows the value of water for dry - 
season rice in Bangladesh. Our estimate of the value of conserved water from using 
AWD on a single plot is therefore 1,115 taka per year ($13.9). The estimated benefits 
from water conservation are an orde r of magnitude greater than the benefits from 
reduced CO
2 emissions.  
In summary, the technology we study can del iver substantial environmental benefits.  
However, farmers valuing the technology, and using it properly, depends on water having a marginal pric e. 
7. Discussion  
7.1 Introduction 
In our first experiment, we offer rigorous evidence on the causal effect of AWD on water 
savings, profits and input costs. The average effect of AWD on these outcome variables 
was small and insignificant. We observed no significant difference between treatment 36  and control plots in the frequency of dry fields or in the level of water in the field. Our 
results show that a sizable number of farmers dry their fields even without AWD. Thus 
continuously irrigating the rice plot may not be the correct counterfactual for evaluating 
AWD.  
However, we find that AWD has significant effects only in plots where farmers pay 
volumetric pricing. There is a 18% decrease in the height of the observed water in the 
field and a 19% decrease in the probability of the field being dry. These water savings 
occur in the first 70 days after planting. Our magnitude estimates under volumetric pricing fall at the 25% of existing estimates from laboratory evaluations of AWD. However, the failure to price water see ms to explain the divergence between our 
estimates from the field and those from the laboratory. Most lab experiments are unable 
to incorporate behavioral elements in their analysis.  
A limitation of the first RCT was that volumetric pricing may be correlat ed with un-  
observables that affect the heterogeneous impacts of AWD use. Thus in the second 
experiment, we observe that demand for AWD is elastic, with an elasticity of 1.7 at the 
midpoint of prices offered. Similar observations have been made in the heal th and 
development literature: revealed willingness to pay for water purification in Ghana is 
orders of magnitude below the estimated benefits to households (Berry, Fischer, and 
Guiteras,  2018).  Moreover, the willingness to pay for the technology was low, compared 
to the estimated benefits of installing an AWD pipe on a typiocal plot, which is about 533 
taka. Our estimate of the marginal cost of production for the pipe is 133 taka, but at this 
price, demand is close to zero.  
There are several limitations of our study. We do not experiment with the level of the 
hourly irrigation price. Instead, we encourage a switch from a seasonal contract to hourly 
billing, where the hourly price is set uniformly  by the local irrigation authority. Our 
treatment only approximates volumetric pricing because hours pumped is imperfectly 
cor- related with the volume of water extracted. Given that electricity accounts for a large 
share of the pumping cost, our treatment  moves the pricing regime towards marginal 
cost pricing. But we do not necessarily introduce the socially optimal hourly price 
because that price would need to incorporate the externality costs  of electricity 
generation. Im plementing volumetric pricing is difficult due to its high cost and political 
pressure from farmers, some of whom may lose under the new regime (Tsur and Dinar,  
1997).  How- ever, our study shows that a simple digital payment technology moves the 
pricing regime closer to marginal cost pricing and induces farmers to put more value on conservation technology. In essence, encouraging volumetric pricing leads to a 
perceptible change in the farmer’s attitude towards conservation, as  measured by the 
shift in their demand for the technology.  
We also do not measure water use on farmer plots perfectly. We observe whether the field is dry and measure the depth of the water level during randomized visits. These 
measurement can introduce er ror in our estimates.  
However, there is no field evidence that documents the role seasonal water charges play 
in discouraging efficient agriculture water use (see Zilberman and Schoengold (2005)).  
To our knowledge, this is the first paper that randomly introduces volumetric pricing for 
agricultural water. Fishman et al.  (2016)  use non- experimental variation to study the 37  water savings from a program in India where farmers voluntarily installed meters and 
were compensated for electricity savings relative to baseline consumption. They find no 
effect of the program on groundwater pumping.  
7.2 Policy and program relevance: evidence uptake and use  
In the several workshops we organized, there was intense discussion on the importance of water conservation and specifically AWD in water management. Policy makers and 
scientists involved in AWD research and extension in Bangladesh accepted our t entative 
findings and have promised to discuss follow -up in coordination with other agencies.  
In the larger literature in development and environmental economics, our study shows that inefficient factor pricing may explain why technologies that are available, proven in the laboratory, and seemingly in reach of farmers continue to exhibit low rates of 
adoption. Earlier explanations have focused on failures in output markets (Ashraf, Gine´ , 
and Karlan, 2009),  behavioral biases (Duflo, Kremer, and Robinson,  2011),  frictions in 
insurance or credit markets (Karlan et al., 2014; Cole, Gine´, and Vicker y, 2017), 
unobservable input quality (Bold et al.,  2017),  heterogeneity in the  net benefits and costs 
of adoption (Sur i, 2011),  and learning frictions (Conley and Udr y, 2010;  Hanna, 
Mullainathan, and Schwartzstein,  2014;  Beaman et al.,  2015).
18 We add to this debate by 
showing that the pricing mechanism fo r a critical factor of production inhibits technology 
adoption.19  
7.3 Challenges and lessons 
A key challenge of the study was in understanding why farmers do not use the AWD 
technology, even after purchasing them. While take up is reasonably high, when 
measured by purchasing an AWD pipe, installation and use of the pipe is modest. Only 
18.4% of pur chasing farmers installed the AWD pipes on one of their rice plots.20 
Anecdotally, there are numerous explanations for not installing AWD. Farmers sometimes report hav ing lost the pipe between the time of purchase and planting. Some 
farmers reported that they would install the pipe “in a few days.”
21 After conferring with 
                                                
18 Jack (2011),  de Janvry, Sadoulet, and Suri  (2017),  and Magruder  (2018)  provide 
comprehensive re-  views of the literature on technology adoption in developing country 
agriculture.  
19 Outside of agricultural technology, inefficiently low (marginal) prices for electricity have been 
shown to reduce development and adoption of energy -efficiency technologies in developed 
countries. Borenstein and Bushnell  (2018)  find that electricity is priced below its social marginal 
cost in many parts of the United States. At the same time, a literature on induced innovation 
shows a positive association between electricity prices and development of energy -efficie ncy 
technologies (Newell, Jaffe, and Stavins,  1999;  Popp,  2002).  Other studies find that consumers 
shift to fuel -efficient vehic les when gasoline prices are high (Busse,  Knittel, and Zettelmeyer,  
2013;  Allcott and Wozny,  2014).  
20 A low rate of usage, conditional on purchasing, has been observed for fertilizer trees in Zambia  
(Jack et al.,  2015)  and improved latrines in Cambodia (Ben Yishay et al.,  2017).  The literature on 
technology adoption of health products, on the other hand, has generally found larger rates of 
follow -through (Dupas,  2014a).  
21 Farmers that purchased pipes were told that AWD should be practiced starting 10 days after 
transplanting. The date of the verification survey was randomized and survey teams arrived less 
than 10 days after planting in fewer than 1% of cases. Moreover, the rate of uptake (conditional 38  others, some farmers suggested that it was not feasible to use AWD individually because 
of coordinat ion externalities. Two examples were common. Farmers with low -lying land 
often get water that spills over into their plot when it is being pumped into a nearby 
higher field. Also, a common per -acre water price makes it easy for the tube well 
operator to ir rigate multiple fields at a time. Adoption of AWD by a subset of the farmers 
becomes less practical when each farmer does not have full control over when their field 
is irrigated.  
8. Conclusions and recommendations  
We can draw the following conclusions and of fer these recommendations:  
1. Policy maker, global, national, local: The results obtained from AWD in 
experiment stations can only be replicated in the field if farmers pay a marginal 
price for water. When farmers pay a fixed price that is unrelated to the volume of water they use, the water savings from AWD are statistically insignificant. Across the whole country, water and electricity savings from even modest adoption of the 
technology would be significant.  
2. Policy maker, national, local: In villages which are equipped with tube wells that 
can accept debit cards, facilitating the debit card application process for individual farmers results in a shift in the demand for AWD. More farmers purchased the 
AWD device, especially at the higher prices. However, even after purchase, 
installation of the pipe was low. Most farmers did not install the pipe, suggesting 
that other factors may affect their ability to reduce water use.  
3. Policy maker and Researcher, global, national, local: Our findings suggest that the social benefits of AWD are large, mainly in the form of savings of electricity for pumping as well as the value of the water that can be used later. The benefits 
are an order of magnitude higher than the cost of producing the pipe.  
4. Policy maker, Researcher, global, national, local: One key challenge may be to 
engage in reform of water pricing policies so that farmers face the correct incentives. While changing pricing mechanisms at the local level may be a 
daunting task, some farmers are likely to lose under the t ransition and therefore 
resist change. Our second experiment shows that at least in villages where the 
infrastructure for digital payment exists, increasing the penetration of the digital 
payment system can significantly alter water conservation behavior among 
farmers. In areas where this infrastructure does not exist currently, it may be 
worthwhile to think of policies that encourage new tubewells to come equipped 
with a meter than can accept individual debit cards.  
  
                                                
on purchasing) is only 20% for the farmers that were visited more than 50 days after 
transplanting. Therefore, procrastination, combined with our surveys being early in the season, 
cannot fully explain the low rate of installation.  39  Online appendix es

  In recent years, rice is increasing being 
planted in the dry season mainly due to 
the availability of tubewell irrigation. While 
the use of such techniques leads to an 
increase in food production and self-
sufficiency, it also depletes ground water 
levels in many rice-producing regions. To 
address this issue, researchers at the 
International Rice Research Institute have 
developed the alternate wetting and 
drying technique that can be used to save 
water, further contributing to environment 
conservation. This impact evaluation 
focuses on the effect of this technique, as 
compared to the conventional way of 
flood irrigation, on water savings and farm 
incomes in Bangladesh. This study would 
be useful to policymakers who are keen to 
explore if wider adoption of this technique 
would be beneficial.

Abstract  
The digital divide phenomenon  arose in the early 90s due to internet  popularization and 
telecommunications and information use management development.  Numerous  studies and 
authors agree that the basic premise of the digital divide is the difference that exists between 
individuals and societies that have access to computing , telecommunications and internet 
technology resources and those that do not  (Schielfe 2008, Van Dijk & Hacker 2003, Servon 
2002, OECD 2001, Ginsburg, Sabatini & Wagner 2000) . The importance of information as 
a necessary element for society to function properly  is where this phenomenon  has its main 
emphasis, since those who do not have access to  information,  or have marginal contact with 
it, are excluded from a successful incorporation to social development.  
This work analyses  results of a study  focused on gender differences in the use of technologie s 
during a trai ning program called: Reduction of the Digital Divide in Vulnerable and Young 
People of Vulnerable Communities (REBREDIG -PJA) of a southern Mayan -speaking area 
of Yucatan. Th is study ´s results are discussed concurring to Mexico´s  National Development 
Plan (2013 -2018) and National Digital Strategy (2013) guidelines  and compared with  
parameters stated in Yucatan State Development Plan ( 2012 -2018 ).

Introduction  
In the dawn of the 1990’s, the digital divide phenomenon arose  because of  Internet´s 
popularization and telecommunications  development  on information use and administratio n 
(ICT) . Several  researchers  (Lichy, 2011 , Eynon, 2009, Schielfe, 2008, Livingstone & 
Helsper, 2007, Van Dijk & Hacker 2003, Cooper  & Weaver , 2003, Servon, 20 02, OECD, 
2001, Ginsburg, Sabatini & Wagner, 2000) agree that digital divide´s  basic premise is  the 
gap that computing, telecommunication and  internet build between individuals and societies 
that have access to these resources and those who do not.  Since i nformation , the highlight of 
this phenomenon  is an important and essential element to create connections  helping society 
to work properly and fairly , therefore, those who do not have access to information , or have 
it in a marginal way, are excluded from  a successful incorporation to social development.  
Globally , digital divide´s impact  has been the subject of numerous studies: Leaving no one 
Behind from digital divide to digital empowerment (UNESCO; 2017);  Bridging the digital 
divide in the EU  (Negreiro ; 2015);  Digital Dividends  (The World Bank, 2016) ; Capturing 
Digital Dividends and Closing Digital Divides  (OCDE, 2013) ; Bridging Gaps, Building 
Opportunity – Broadband as a Catalyst of Economic Growth and Social Progress in Latin 
America and the C aribbean  (IDB, 2012) . In Spain, for  example, the 2016 Statistical 
Yearbook, issued  by the National Institute of Statistics (INE) found that, according to the 
2016 Survey on Equipment and Use of Information and Communication Technologies in 
homes, 18.1% of households  in Spain do not have access to Internet ( INE, 2016), show ing 
that a significant percentage of Spanish houses  are excluded from the di gital universe. In 
terms of gender , there is a gap of 3.4% per person (pp), which means the percentage of male 
Internet users by 2014 were 77.9% and for women 74.5% , results that may seem acceptable, 
but compared  with Finland, Norway, New Zealand or Ireland, situation is far from expected 
internet access gender parity . 
Castaño , Martín and Martínez (2011) outlined  a composite indicators system to describe the 
gender digital divide through a study conducted in 31 European countries. This tool , called 
Gender and ICT Indicators System  (SIGTIC) , allows: a) to make inter -gender compa risons, 
determined by the degree of e -equality; b) perform intra -gender analysis, depending on the 
degree of e -inclusion of each sex; and c) contextualize the results obtained with those 
corresponding to 31 European countries. The outcomes show the presenc e of a gender digital 
divide , determined not only by  e-access, but also by the level of e -inclusion , showing a clear  
                        Vol. 11, Núm. 21 Julio - Diciembre 2020, e 104 
feminine disadvantage in the intensity of ICT use, addition ally presents evidence of the  use 
certain  segment s of internet according to gender: recreational  and economic (masculin e); of 
social welfare ( feminine ). 
In the article The digital divide between Male and Female users in Internet Public Access 
Sites , Dixon, Correa, Straubhaar, Covarrubias, Graber and Spencer (2 014),  examine the 
evidence of the gender digital  divide  in public internet access points (community technology 
centres , libraries  and others ) in Austin , Texas. Using extensive observations of the 
participants , authors found that male users are the most numerous  group in public access to 
internet use, even considering  age and ethnicity. Similarly, in -depth interviews revealed that 
both sexes saw public access  places , differen t form libraries, as  the least desira ble to use 
internet . In the case  of libraries , the study revealed women associated them with books and 
family nostalgia, while m en related  them . Finally, elder users described technophobia 
feelings .  
In this logic , USA´s  National Center for Women & Information Technology  (NCWIT, 2010) 
stated that 56% of the  2009  Advanced Placement exam  applicants were  women, but females 
only represented 18% of the people who took the exam in the Computer Science  area (CS 
AP). In fact, since 1999, the Advanced Place ment Program in Computer Science has 
systematically been the program with fewer women (NCWIT, 2010). NCWIT data is 
consistent with information found in countries such as Canada ( Dionne -Simard, Galarneau 
& Larochelle -Coté, 2016 ); Germany (Schinzel, 2017);  United Kingdom  (WISE,  2015); 
China ( Powell & Chang, 2016)  and Romania ( Ward, Dragne & Lucas, 2014), all 
documenting in recent years a significant decrease in women ´s enrollment  in study fields 
related to technology and engineering . 
United Kingdom ´s British Council (2016) carried out a study entitled: Gender equality and 
empowerment of women and girls in the UK , where th is parliamentary committee mentions 
that, despite the great global impact of digital technology and «Big data» in public an d 
consumer services , benefits are not shared equally,  and technology is playing an important 
role in  the emergence of new inequalities (gaps).  As a developed country,  the U K has almost 
achieved universal primary and secondary education. Girls enjoy greater  educational 
achievements, but there are still some areas where results are not fair. There is a clear gender 
segregation in areas selected by young woman in secondary and postsecondary education, 
mainly in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathem atics)  related ones. Due to  
                        Vol. 11, Núm. 21 Julio - Diciembre 2020, e 104 
low participation in STEM in the UK, women represent only 15% of ICT professionals 
(European average is 18%) and less than 30% of the entire ICT workforce. These proportions  
are stagnant when analyzed and compared with the compo rtment  of other developed 
countries. Similarly, the study s hows  that worldwide, the number of female technology 
directors has remained immobile  for the last ten years.  
In Albury, Australia , Atkinson, Black & Curtis (2008) studied  the digital divide in th is region  
focusing  on its existence , identifying strategies to address it, and developing a methodology 
to explore it in any context. Results showed the existence of  digital divide, i s linked  to 
computer access  differences in access and related to income level, city  area of residency , age 
range  and education. In general, the model indicate s that individuals  with lower levels of 
education  and income and higher age range  report a greater incidence of the digital divide . 
However, the authors,  based on their research, mention  ways to deal with the digital divide 
that could be applied to contexts where this phenomenon exists : training and technical 
support provision to the a ffected, improvement of access, approach to ICT services 
knowledge, as well as the pro curement  of appropriate hardware and software for 
disadvantaged groups.  
The research: Digital Technologies and Gender  Justice in India , Gurumurthy & Chami  
(2014) mention s that the  2013  International Telecommunication  Union measurement  on 
information society places India in the «least Connected Countries » category, based on the 
composite media of ICT access , technology use skills  and ICT use. Cited  study  defines  less 
connected countries as those in which ""... access and use of information and communication 
technologies are limited to basic voice and low -speed data services ”. This study also 
mentions , that in  the Indian context, there is gender gap  in ICT access , data concurs  with 
information other  studies  and authors , who have found that  11.6% of male Indians are 
connected online  while only 8.4% of Indian women  are (Anderson, 2015; World Economic 
Forum , 2013;  Vigneswara, 2013 ), therefore , Intel (2013), appraised a 27% weighted gender 
difference, mean ing females  in India are 27% less likely to have internet access than m en. 
Added to that , researches by  the GSMA Development Fund  and the Cherie Blair Foundation  
have found that only 28% of Indian women have a mobile p hone, compared to 40% of men 
(GSMA, 2010).

In Mexico, Yucatan´s Autonomous University (UADY)  and Yucatan´s state government 
education ministry (SEGEY), supported a study conducted by Dominguez, Canto, Ortega 
and McCalman (2016) study, with teachers from 1 9 high schools, 85% belonging to an urban 
environment (Merida) and 15% to rural settings located in towns such as Umán, Caucel and 
Acanceh. Main results showed teachers belonging to urban educational centers had better 
skills for ICT use, compared with tho se in rural environments. It was also observed that there 
is a digital divide between participants sex, since men registered better ICT use competencies 
in comparison with women.  
Outcomes form  previously reviewed intentional studies (Gurumurthy & Chami, 2014 ; 
Castaño, Martín & Martínez, 2011 ; Atkinson, Black & Curtis, 2008  and Cooper, 2006) and  
those carried out in Maya -speaking contexts of south -eastern  Mexico  (Domínguez, Canto, 
Ortega & McCalman , 2016), coincide this era is characterized by preci pitous changes in 
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) which affect the way society  learn s, 
work s and relate s, despite the fact that in developing countries  a growing gap  is emerging , a 
new form of division or exclusion , in which women seem to have disadvantage s facing the 
benefits of technological  evolution  and information society , marginalizing them from 
employment, income and education opportunities of improve ment  in this digital age.  
 
Method  
Rese arch´s methodological development was mixed -type in an applied setting . Design was 
carried out under  an action research  focus , a scientific research method widely nowadays  in 
several countries  as Great Britain, Germany, USA, Spain, Canada, Australia , among others  
(Boggino & Rosekrans, 2007 and Elliot, 2005). This work was part of a larger study aiming  
to reduce the digital divide between  young people and adults ( YP&A) of vulnerable 
communities in southern Yucatan by strengthening their digital  ICT use skills . 
At the research -action  stage a training program me called REBREDIG -PJA was 
implement ed, lasting five  months and integrated by  thirteen  units of competen ce. The se units 
were gradually constructed and presented in complexity order from computer basic 
knowledge  (how to connect, turn on / off, keys knowledge) to possible ICT consequences on 
health (postures, addictions , etcetera ). It was meaningful  the assistance  received from  three 
community advisers belonging to Yucatan´s Adult s Education Institute  (IEAEY) and three  
experts from UADY ´s ICT area during the construction of the  programme.

Community characteristics  
According to Mexico ´s last population census raised  in 2010  by the National Institute of 
Statistics and Geography (INEGI) , Mayapan is one of the one hundred and six municipalities 
of Yucatan . By that time , INEGI  (2010) reported  3,269 inhabitants , representing  0.2% of the 
state´s population , and for every 105 men there were  100 women , population  median age was 
19 years. Finally, for every 100 people at productive age (15 to 64 years) there are 80 at 
dependency age (under 15  or over 64  years ). 
Average number of live births by age group is very vari able in this county;  it ranges from  0.3 
children born alive  in women between 15 and 19 years up to 6.1 for women between 45 and 
49 years.  
Indicators related to ICT in this community are relevant and significant to this study . INEGI 
results show ed that for every 100 homes only one had internet connection, which has serious 
social implications , widening the digital divide. On top of that , only  1.9% of the population 
has a computer, it is reasonable to think that  of every 100 homes scarcely two homes  have a 
computer. Furthermore , just 7.4% have telephone service and 29% mobile telephony.  
Examining population´s educational level, it is noticed that 588 inhabitants  have no 
education, 78.8%  of them  have basic education, 2.4% have higher secondary education and 
only 0.6% (19 people) have higher education . Incidentally , we must not forget  many authors  
(Dominguez, 2015 ; Atkinson, Black & Curtis, 2008 ), have  determ ined the absence of post-
secondary educ ation as one of the main  factors that contribute s to sharpen the digital divide 
phenomenon . 
 
Participants  
This research involved 119 YP&A  from Mayapan , participating in  the second year of the 
project Reduction of the digital divide in vulnerable communities of Yucatan ; 70 women 
(58.8%) and 49 men (41.2%). Partakers’  ages ranged from 13 to 53 years being the average 
age 16 years. 98.5% of  participants 98.5% are Maya -speakers. Table  1 presents  results of 
main variables that best characterize partici pating population :

As shown  above, 67.2% of the participants (80) have middle school  (7th to 9th grade ), 
followed  by 29.4% (35) with elementary level (1st to 6th grade) and only 4% have high school  
level  (10th to 12th grade) . Regard ing marital status, the majority  is single (82.4%), followed 
by married subjects ( 15%) and at last those  who live in consensual union ( 6%). Concerning 
the participants parents ´ education,  mother s (women ) without studies (37) are more than 
fathers ( men) that are only  23. However , analysing  parents academic training , both mothers 
(53%) and fathers  (54.6%)  prime st udy level is elementary . Overall , Table  I show s important 
parents  lack schooling , having women higher rates , in this type of Mayan -speaking 
communities.  
 
Instrument  
Instrument  was constructed by Domínguez, Vázquez, Suaste & Cab (2016),  considering 
demographic and personal data relevant to the study , adopting a Likert -type measurement 
scale with one step and six levels , where  YP&A were asked  to think about the ir competencies 
realization level (CCC), considering an ascending numerical scale from 0 to 5.

Simultaneously, participants were queried to assess if the competence would be important to 
get a job (CICT) and if they would be interested in learning this competence (EIA), as shown 
in Table  2. 
Thirteen  competences composed t he instrument and  gave a dia gnosis on those YP&A  had to 
strengthen. Table  3 presents domains that integrated the instrument, for better underst anding 
purposes, emphasizing  that each assessment was integrated by three sections  (CCC, CICT, 
EIA)  as mentioned previously .

messages on the cell phone; exchang ing information by email; chat through tools like 
Whatsapp and participate in social networks like Facebook, Instagram , amongst others.  
Women also obtained higher scores  on internet use risks (x = 1.70)  than men (x = 1.66) .

First, population was divided in  five groups , participants belonging to groups one (13 to 21 
years) two  (22 to 30 years) obtained the best scores in their knowledge about the use of 
technology at the beginning of the program.  
At the same time , there is only one compet ence in which all age groups are below  average  
(Copyright knowledge) , related to: identifying copyright within any software , application or 
work, detecting when content is protected by copyright or licenses, knowing the 
consequences of downloading protected digital content from internet (music, movies . 
etcetera ); know ing copyright  and / or creative commons  symbols.  
Finally , results point toward the older the participant, fewer  compet ences  they have for  
technology usage , conduct observed at age group 5  (48 to 53 years), where no ne of the  
compet ences  exceeds the average.

To begin with,  married people and those living on consensual u nion have  lowe r level s of 
digital compet ence when  compared to singles. This situation  could reflect they spend les s 
time on ICT´s due to the re sponsibilit ies they face on daily basis in parallel with bachelors . 
In the same manner  of age, Copyright knowledge is the compet ence with the lowest scores  
in all groups, indicating a generalizable deficiency for the entire population.  
 
Pre-test competence level by study degree  
Figure 3 highlight s results for participant´s study levels . As might be expected , partakers with 
elementa ry and middle school levels are close to the minimum proficiency boundary  (dotted 
line), indicat ing these participators have weaker competences  towards t echnology  use. 
As might be expected , the higher the study level, technological usage and knowledge 
improves, as illustrated in Figure 3, where participants with a high school  diploma , obtained 
scores  above  the average line in the thirteen digital compet ences.

Elements inhibiting digital divide  reduction in Mayan -speaking 
communities  
As part of the methodology used in this work, training program participants were divided in 
two focus groups. Qualitative data analysis and interpretation was formulated using  
ATLAS .ti (version 8) , a tool setting  employed for qualitative analysis of large bodies of 
textual and graphic data from created  hermeneutic unit s (HU). Data analysis process involved 
four stages: data preparation (collection and storage),  initial analysis (open coding), main 
analysis  (indexed system refinement) and results (key concepts, relationships and models). 
During open coding procedure , in the initial analy sis stage, categories and subcategories 
came into sight , as presented in Figure 4  conceptual network.

Some of the most relevant elements inhibiting digital divide reduction integrat ing 
subcategories are the following : 
• Difficult access to internet providers  
• Poor i nfrastructure and facilities  
• Difficulty leaving their homes and participating in program activities  
• Unawareness o n how to work online (platform)  
• Non-Maya -speaking teachers  clarify doubts in Spanish, not Maya  
• Lack of time, due to house  chores and children attention  
• Few inhabited houses with internet access.  
• Security deficiency on ICT  management  
• Technological resources use di strust

• People r umors to block others  growth  
• Envy  
 
Discussion  
Mexico´s official dispositions  on education (National Development Plan 2013 -2018, 
National Digital Strategy, 2013) and for Yucatan  State  (State Development Plan, 2012 -2018 ) 
propose  states and municipalities to outline  and incorporate strategies  to increase educational 
quality in urban and rural areas from elementary  to secondary  level.  
However, despite govern mental guidelines and international recommendations priorit izing a 
more equitable distribution of educational opportunities amongst vulnerable regions and 
social and ethnic groups, with a gender perspective  (OECD, 2017 ; CEPAL, 201 9), reality 
shows there st ill are access, habilitation, academic training  and technology usage and 
management differences between men and women , which increas e opportunities  gap for 
females by not joining knowledge society.  
Literature suggests that digital technology has the potential to create connections, encourage 
learning, raise inclusion levels and even provide lifesaving information. Nevertheless , 
evidence worldwide reports  differences amid  countries, translated to indic ators such as: 
educational level, economic stability, parents s chooling, growth and development; factors 
that collaterally increase cost, coverage, access and digital literacy level barriers of the most 
vulnerable groups imped ing the development of technol ogy use advanced skills.  
An important consideration of this study  is that , notwithstanding  men from  a Maya -speaking 
communit y in Yucatan exhibited better technology use competence levels  in variables such 
as maximum degree of studies, marital status and age. It seems that women , could reach 
better outcomes  by narrowing this gap if they are  promoted more, starting from within their 
famil ies, allow ing them  to access higher education and employ ment levels, breaking cultural 
barriers , as machismo and domination , improving their living conditions. In their own words : 
""We make an effort to be here, in addition to complying with the activities of the program, 
we have to fulfill  with the tasks of our home, which implies being aware of our spouses, taking 
care of our children, and take care of our family.""

Conclusion  
Gender digital divide  phenomenon in Yucatan ´s vulnerable Maya -speaking communities  has 
been little studied in Mexico and documented evidence from scientific studies is incipient. 
However,  factors caus ing it, as well as its consequences, are tasks that require  immediate 
attention for southeastern Mexico inhabitant’s  well-being. Access to computer equipment  
and technology and interne t use enablement are some of the  differences that affect  women, 
broadening the inequality gap with men , sidestepping from  knowledge society , as well as  life 
and work increase and improve ment  conditions.  
This article analyze d differences in technology use between men and women of the Maya -
speaking communit y of Mayapan,  Yucat an through a diagnosis administer ed to 119 people 
prior to participating in a training program called: REBREDIG -PJA. Based on results  
examination , it can be concluded that Mayapan  presents a  gender digital divide , since men 
report  better  skills to use and access technology in comparison with women. A deeper 
analysis suggests that , even with the same level of education,  men have better skills for the 
technology use than women do . If participants are grouped by marital status , single men 
demonstrated better skills for technology  use compared to women in the same condition. 
Finally, age impact on digital competences development  is relevant, conclud ing that at a 
younger age, the existing technologies use competence level is higher, consider ing younger 
partakers  age ranges from 1 3 to 15 years old.  
This paper seeks to  initiate a dialogue about the importance of implementing actions t o allow 
digital  inclusion, regardless of gender, ethnicity, social class, physical condition or disabili ty 
type; therefore,  is essential to raise digital  and technological use  qualification in rural 
communities in  south ern Yucatan. As mentioned in State ´s Development Plan (2013 -2018) 
39 out of the 106 municipalities population  (in average)  has not finished elementary school  
(1st to 6st grade).  In literacy terms , Mérida (state capital), presents the lowest percentage , 
while in southern and eastern municipalities , such as Mayapan, Tahdziu and Chemax , have 
percentages higher than 27% of the population.  
This study findings reveal  a pending work agenda for region al post -secondary institutions  
(Yucatan´s Autonomous University, Campeche´s Autonomous University, Quintana Roo ´s 
University , Chiapas´ Autonomous University and Tabasco´s Juarez Autonomous University) 
as well for state government ministries  and agencies in charge of education  and program 
development  to attention vulnerable communities  [Education Secretary of Yucatan State

Government (SEGEY), Education Secretary of Campeche State Government (SEDUC), 
Education Secretary of Quintana Roo (SEQ), Education Secretary of  Chiapas State, 
Education Secretary of Tabasco ], validat ing this studies results by replicating it through the 
National Institute for Adult Education (INEA) and the Nationa l Commission for the 
Development of Indigenous Communities  (INPI) . Finally, this  study contribute s promot ing 
educational innovation projects , which  focus on  life quality improvement  for Yucatecan 
women , from  vulnerable communities , while  strengthen s the state ´s accountability process 
to increase educational excellence .

DigitalLiteracy,9037.txt,"Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers: Exploring Indonesian Student Teachers’ Initial 
Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into a Teaching Unit

ABSTRACT
Research found that many student teachers are active users of digital technologies yet they are 
reluctant to make use of digital technologies for literacy teaching purposes. Efforts to prepare 
student teachers for technology integration are pressingly needed. Also needed is data that 
informs us about student teachers’ participation (engagement) with digital technologies and how 
they might utilize those technologies for literacy teaching. The article reports on a classroom 
research project that explored Indonesian student teachers’ initial perception about the use of 
digital technologies for EFL teaching. For one semester, the first author taught a course to a 
group of student teachers at a state Islamic university in Jakarta in which they learned conceptual 
and practical knowledge about digital technologies in teaching and learning. The student teachers 
were tasked to explore digital technologies available and had to integrate those technologies into 
teaching units contained in a junior high English textbook. Popular digital technologies selected 
included Facebook, blogs, Skype, and WhatsApp. Each offers unique potential to facilitate and 
enhance language learning. Student reflections provided insight into their considerations for their 
digital technology selections.
Key words:  Digital Literacy, Qualitative, Student Teachers, EFL, Indonesia
INTRODUCTION
Acquiring literacy is fundamental for one’s development. 
People whose literacy skills are developed are more likely 
to explore and reach their potential (UNESCO, 2006). The 
International Literacy Association (ILA), an authoritative 
world literacy organization, publishes on their website a 
definition of literacy:
 Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret, 
create, compute, and communicate using visual, audi -
ble, and digital materials across disciplines and in any 
context. The ability to read, write, and communicate 
connects people to one another and empowers them to 
achieve things they never thought possible (para.1)
The statement highlights two important points. First, the lit -
eracy teaching currently needed should enable people to com -
municate and connect. Second, people currently use various 
modes of communication including text, audio, graph ics, and 
video. This literacy definition encompasses literacy engage -
ment—also an aspect of digital literacy as students engage with 
digital contexts (e.g., digital technologies). Literacy engage -
ment here is understood to be the manner in which students 
engage in learning (participate) using those contexts (Hafner, 
Chik, & Jones, 2015). It is clear, then, that teaching literacy 
skills that enable people to communicate and connect through 
such modes is a key that drives current literacy education.

well developed. USAID (2008) reported that many Indone -
sian K-12 students displayed low critical thinking ability—
they lacked the ability to reflect and evaluate information 
presented to them. This ability is paramount for students to 
be academically and professionally advanced (Spires & Bart -
lett, 2012). Spires and Bartlett contend that in an increasing -
ly digital environment, students must acquire digital literacy 
skills that enable them to select and use digital tools that are 
suitable  for their purposes. Echoing ILA, Spires and Bartlett 
view digital literacy as “a wide-ranging set of practices that 
enable students to create, share, and understand meaning and 
knowledge” in a digital environment (2012, p. 6).
According to ILA’s 2018 report, digital literacy tops the 
list as the most prescient topic to be addressed in literacy 
education. The report surveyed and interviewed research -
ers and literacy educators from around the world. The re -
port also noted that there should be more attention given 
to strategic efforts for excellent literacy education. One of 
those efforts involves teacher preparation that equips student 
teachers with skills to foster students’ literacy development. 
Specifically one that is concerned with digital technology.
To our knowledge, studies that attempted to investigate 
Indonesian student teachers’ use of digital technology for 
teaching and learning are small in number, and they tend to International Journal of Education & Literacy Studies

be quite specific in terms of the use of digital technologies 
(e.g., Rodliyah, 2016). Our research is explorative in the 
sense that we asked student teachers about their preferred 
digital technologies when planning to teach. We claim that 
there is a large gap between the available research and our 
need to be informed about digital technology use among stu -
dent teachers.
Objectives and Research Questions
In this research, we sought to address a question related to 
the digital technology use within a teacher education pro -
gram. We were interested in investigating the learning expe -
riences of student teachers enrolled in a course titled Media 
and Language Learning. The course goal was to educate stu -
dent teachers about teaching a subject (English) that is in -
formed by digital literacy. Specifically, our research aimed to 
investigate the student teachers’ perception about the use of 
digital technologies as they learned about theories and prac -
tices related to the use of digital technologies in teaching and 
learning. Our guiding questions were:
1. What kind of digital technologies would student teach -
ers select to integrate into their teaching plan?
2. What were their considerations when selecting digital 
technologies for teaching and learning?
Digital Literacy and Teacher Education
Research on digital literacy is well documented (e.g., Coiro, 
et al., 2008). Recent developments have provided us with 
information about some digital literacy roles in literacy ed -
ucation. Major reports such as the Cambridge Assessment 
Report summarized several conclusions concerning digital 
literacy in literacy education. First, literacy education should 
encompass the teaching of print, media literacy, and digital 
technology. Second, literature is at the core of literacy teach -
ing, and it should be taught within the context of digital dis -
course (Cambridge Assessment, 2013). These conclusions 
emphasize that digital literacy is a vitally important skill that 
students in the digital age should acquire.
What counts as digital literacy? Spires and Bartlett (2012) 
simplify the scope of digital literacy into three categories: 
finding and utilizing digital content, producing  digital con -
tent, and disseminating digital content. These categories 
highlight complex skills and abilities that students must 
obtain. Skills such as critical thought and value judgment 
are very important for locating and utilizing digital content. 
Likewise, creativity, innovation, and understanding of socio -
logical context are very critical for producing and dissemi -
nating digital contents.
A number of studies have explored digital literacy in 
the context of teacher education. Price-Dennis (2016) and 
Price-Dennis and colleagues (2014) investigated some ef -
forts to prepare student teachers to integrate technology into 
literacy teaching. Their findings reveal a gap between the 
availability and use of digital technologies in classrooms. 
The sentiment is shared by literacy researchers with similar 
interests (Bauer & Kenton, 2005; Doering, Hughes, & Huff -
man, 2003; Koc & Bakir, 2010; Lei, 2009; Wright & Wilson, 2011). This gap in technology use is concerning when con -
sidering that technology is available and a part of students’ 
daily lives. Additionally, a lack of accommodation of digital 
technologies use in a teacher education program will not help 
student teachers to imagine how a pedagogy that involves 
digital technologies can be structured and implemented in 
an established learning environment (classrooms). Although 
limited in number, available research notably demonstrates 
that student teachers tend to be more sensitive to the use of 
digital technologies when they are accustomed to and are 
active users of the digital technologies (Collier, Foley, Mo -
guel & Barnard, 2013; Hundley & Holbrook, 2013; Williams 
& Baumann, 2008). We may conclude that what is pressing 
in promoting digital technologies in teacher education is the 
effort to instruct student teachers to learn “about, through, 
and with technology” (Cervetti, Damico, & Pearson, 2006, 
p. 383), including instruction on how to be active participant 
in digital literacy practices (Hundley & Holbrook, 2013). 
Meanwhile, other studies also present us with the possibility 
of managing an online learning environment (Juzwik et al., 
2012) and its relation to promoting student teachers’ confi -
dence in writing skill (Norman & Spencer, 2005).
To summarize, the aforementioned research has informed 
us that it is crucial for teachers to be active users of digital 
technologies in order to benefit from them. Included in those 
benefits is the use of digital technologies within a learning 
environment that enables student teachers to increase their 
confidence in literacy skill learning.
METHODS
Context and Participants
Our research utilized a qualitative paradigm and took place 
within an undergraduate English education program at 
a state affiliated Islamic university in Jakarta. For one se -
mester, the first author taught a course called Media and 
 Language Learning. The 35 enrolled student research par -
ticipants could be described as active users of leading social 
media platforms. For instance, a quick survey conducted at 
the beginning of the course showed that all student teach -
er participants had Facebook accounts and were actively 
logged in. All of them owned digital technology devices 
such as laptops and smartphones, enabling them to access 
digital information and data using a wireless network.
The Course and Data Sources
The course content encompassed basic discussions of tech -
nology in teaching, different kinds of technology, and dig -
ital literacy and its teaching application. The course aimed 
to promote development of Indonesian student teachers’ 
digital literacy. In order to do that, course goals empha -
sized building the student teachers’ conceptual and practi -
cal knowledge about teaching English through the use of 
modern technology. To facilitate this process, the student 
teachers were assigned the text Teaching English Language 
Learners Through Technology  by Erben, Ban, and Castañe -
da (2009). Each week they took turns leading the book Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers: Exploring Indonesian Student  
Teachers’ Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into a Teaching Unit 55
discussion. Selected chapters from Dudeney, Hockly, and 
Pegrum’s (2013) Digital Literacies  were also assigned and 
discussed to broaden the perspective about technology use 
in teaching that would include digital literacy, especially the 
idea of creating and sharing digital contents. The course as -
signments were directly tied to the use of media technology 
for language learning. They included writing weekly reflec -
tive papers on the readings and classroom discussions. The 
student teachers were assigned to expand teaching units by 
integrating digital technologies relevant to each unit. Work -
ing in groups, they used a grade seven English textbook (an 
official Kurikulum 2013 textbook) to exercise their working 
understanding about technology and learning by way of in -
fusing relevant technologies into units of teaching contained 
in the textbook. The students were encouraged to explore 
available and familiar technology and to make sense of how 
those technologies might be beneficial for learning. All of 
these assignments were submitted to the instructor in both 
paper and electronic copies. The copies become the data 
sources for this research.
Digital Literacy Focus
Digital literacy in relation to the teaching of English in this 
research focused on the integration of digital technologies 
into language teaching (Dudeney et al., 2013; Hockly, 2013). 
In Hockly’s work entitled  Digital Literacies: What are They 
and Why Should We Care?,  Hockly argues that it is impera -
tive for language teachers to teach media literacy skills and 
digital competencies (digital literacy or an “ability to effec -
tively make use of the technologies at our disposal” (2013, 
para. 2). Beyond simply gaining practical technical skills, 
Hockly asserts that digital literacy in EFL teaching will en -
able students to use and create digital products and connect 
to wider audiences of fellow digital readers and writers.
Data Analysis
To analyze our data, we followed a tradition of Grounded 
Theory which enabled us to approach data organically and 
minimize certain theoretical assumptions. We used Ground -
ed Theory’s general principles as put forward by Strauss and 
Corbin (Glesne, 2006) of re-reading the data sources for the 
identification of themes, re-analyzing the data by continu -
ously comparing themes across data (constant comparative 
method), and then using open coding to identify themes and 
patterns of data.
Overall, this process included four phases: first, compar -
ing results with emerging themes; second, testing and rede -
fining the themes; third, continuing to reduce the number of 
themes; and fourth, constructing explanatory theory position 
data.
In the first phase, we categorized our coding following 
a wide range of themes, including the four language skills 
(listening, reading, speaking, and writing) and vocabulary 
teaching. Second, as we coded we learned that a number 
of digital technologies were frequently found across the 
themes. For instance, Facebook was found in the themes of 
writing, reading, and vocabulary teaching. We also collapsed the initial themes that separated technologies being used as 
a tool for instruction and being used for learning activities; 
instead, we focused on describing activities that student 
teachers performed with digital technologies. Therefore, as 
a result of reduction in the third phase, we focused on the 
themes that specified explicitly the kinds of digital technol -
ogies that student teachers preferred in the activities within 
their lessons. Finally, we connected the themes with theo -
retical justification. For instance, in explaining the student 
teachers’ preference for learning in a Facebook closed group 
space (they used it as an electronic classroom that allows 
anyone to engage in active participation), we referred to a 
theory that highlights the importance of providing language 
learners with many opportunities/spaces to use their lan -
guage productively and meaningfully (Erben et al., 2009).
In every phase of data collection and analysis, our goal 
was the data would present us literacy teaching that emerged 
from data sources collected from research participants. Spe -
cifically, we focused on digital literacy put forward earlier by 
Hockley that entails the “ability to effectively make use of 
the technologies at our disposal” (2013, para. 2). We want -
ed to know which of many accessible teaching technologies 
the student teachers preferred as shown within their lesson 
plans.
We then narrated the final themes while guided by these 
research questions: What kind of digital technologies would 
student teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan? 
and What were their considerations when selecting digital 
technologies for teaching and learning?
RESULTS
The main themes that we highlighted from our data involved 
digital technology use for teaching. More specifically, our 
data suggest that the digital technologies appeared to have 
great potential for teaching English language skills. In show -
ing the findings, we discuss the amounts of data that corre -
spond to digital technologies being selected—answering the 
question: What kind of digital technologies would student 
teachers select to integrate into their teaching plan?  Embed -
ded in the discussion are student teachers’ considerations for 
selecting those technologies, answering the question: What 
were their considerations when selecting digital technolo -
gies for teaching and learning?  Our findings discussion will 
follow the following order: Facebook closed groups, blogs, 
Skype (and other V oIPs), and WhatsApp.
Facebook Closed Group
Of all the features in Facebook, a Facebook closed group 
was the student teachers’ most preferred digital technology. 
Creating a closed group is the first step to transform Face -
book into a space for teaching and learning activities. Many 
student teachers in this research claimed that a Facebook 
closed group is an ideal place to facilitate e-classrooms  as 
the platform enables students to have interactive discussions .
According to our student teachers, a Facebook closed 
group offers experiences found in typical online classrooms 
(online class environment). They are free to ‘post’ from a 56 IJELS 6(3):53-60
wide variety of digital formats such as videos and news 
links. They can invite others for discussion in the ‘comment’ 
section. Similar to a regular class, students in a Facebook 
group can conveniently perform activities such as getting 
information from students, disseminating information, and 
reviewing books with ease. Students just need to copy a link 
and share it to a group wall. Images, videos, and video links 
from Youtube can all be posted, and all of these can be used 
for classroom discussion. Students can also post an elec -
tronic document, for example, as part of a class assignment 
submission; they can submit their assignments by upload -
ing electronic copies onto a group wall. They would then 
‘tag’ the teacher to notify him or her that the assignment has 
been submitted. Similarly, teachers can also tag any students 
whose assignments have not been submitted. Many student 
teachers found this seemingly transparent process exciting 
and motivating. For one, they are able to read classmates’ 
work. Furthermore, they enjoyed participating in the Face -
book group since it opened wide opportunities for students to 
comment and to give ‘likes’ (a thumbs-up icon). They argued 
that teachers will benefit from having opportunities available 
to provide additional teaching resources beyond the textbook 
by sharing digital content to a Facebook group wall. A  stu-
dent teacher succinctly stated these aforementioned potential 
benefits of a Facebook closed group as follows: “ Facebook 
closed group as an online platform can be used as a place 
to share materials, discussions between teachers, students 
(and colleagues), collect assignments, and other activities .”
The student teachers felt that a Facebook group’s most 
useful feature lies in its ability to provide a space for inter -
active discussion. One type of interactive discussion they 
planned to do in a Facebook group would look like the fol -
lowing: the teacher writes on a group wall questions related 
to a song and students then comment on these questions (the 
song should have been played earlier in classroom). In an -
other case, the teacher uploads a set of images with differ -
ent expressions which then students will comment on with 
narrative descriptions for each one of those images. Other 
interactive discussions may occur when students exchange 
comments or give feedback on assignments that their class -
mates upload on the group wall. Students will gain benefits 
from both exercising their writing skills as well as learning 
from classmates. For teachers, activities such as these will 
allow them to monitor students’ writing skill development.
Continuing the example activity above, student teachers 
in this study planned an activity involving writing a descrip -
tion about a range of different expressions. They would then 
ask specifically for students to write a descriptive piece using 
adjectives. Other students would have a chance to comment 
on each adjectival description and state which one they found 
well written. Student teachers felt that this peer commenting 
and ‘liking’ would motivate their students to do their best in 
order to earn positive feedback. In short, student teachers in 
this study appeared to be convinced that a Facebook group 
is a good space for interactive activities. Similarly, the stu -
dent teachers suggested that the use of a Facebook group to 
enhance student learning could be maximized. Most specifi -
cally, they planned to use online groups to extend the limited hours of classroom instruction. In their teaching plan, they 
assigned after school online work to maintain the interactive 
discussion about topics yet to be mastered/comprehended by 
students.
Student teachers also expressed feeling less intimidated  
within the Facebook group, and they felt this more com -
fortable  space increased their potential for learning. They 
reflected on their own experiences as active Facebook users 
and noted that they could express their opinions more freely 
there than in a typical classroom. As one student teacher re -
marked, “ We prefer Facebook because in here students tend 
to be active and free to express an opinion when asked by 
teachers .” Many confessed that they often feel too embar -
rassed or intimidated to share opinions in class. One student 
teacher claimed that “ Facebook has an ability to encourage 
students so that they feel comfor table  to express opinions 
without fearing of making mistakes .”
Blogs
Blogs (weblogs or online journals) were quite popular 
among student teachers. Many maintained a blog and wrote 
regularly about a variety of topics that interested them. They 
seemed to nurture their writing habit on a blog, so it is not 
surprising that a blog’s potential for writing skill develop -
ment appeared obvious for many of them. Creating a blog 
involves establishing an account with a blogging platform. 
Many student teachers mentioned Blogspot.com, Wordpress.
com, and Wattpad as popular sites in Indonesia. Some of the 
writing-related activities they planned to do included explor -
ing different  genres of writing . Student teachers discussed 
having their students study the descriptive writing genre by 
writing about their favorite singers. Other genre writing such 
as poetry could be based upon a theme of their choice such as 
parents, friends, and teachers. Student teachers also planned 
to ask students to complete an interactive dialogue activi -
ty on a blog. First students would write a dialogue from a 
picture depicting settings, characters, or an activity). They 
would then write their version of dialogue on their own blog. 
Later, students would visit their classmates’ blogs and leave 
comments, suggestions, and perhaps alternative dialogues. 
The students could use classmates’ feedback and comments 
to revise their writing. Another interactive writing idea 
was to have students develop a letter for correspondence 
to a classmate (letter writing). Unlike the previous activity, 
students would publish a revised letter on their blog. They 
would address it to a classmate whom they intend to become 
a letter recipient.
Student teachers also proposed a blog activity for reading 
and writing connection  (Lee, 2015). The planned teaching 
process would begin with students responding to a reading. 
Through the written summarizing or retelling, student com -
prehension would be apparent, and their writing progress 
within the blog posts would be evident. Their gradual writing 
process would be documented on the blog from beginning to 
final draft. In this case, documenting their writing process on 
a blog would enable students to have a firsthand experience 
of writing as a process and give them control and responsi -
bility for their writing process (a sense of writing ownership).Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers: Exploring Indonesian Student  
Teachers’ Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into a Teaching Unit 57
Including blogs in their teaching plans may seem natural 
as the student teachers have already used blogs to write and 
document their thoughts and feelings. When blogging, they 
include hashtags (defined by Merriam-Webster web dictio -
nary as “a word or phrase preceded by the symbol # that clas -
sifies or categorizes the accompanying text”). Incorporating 
hashtags within these digital platforms such as Wattpad 
gives them a sense of connection to others who have simi -
lar interests. Clicking on hashtags takes them to other blogs 
where they are able to learn and be inspired by other peo -
ple’s writing. Having a personal space through a blog and 
at the same time wanting to connect with others seemed to 
dominate the student teachers’ preference to integrate blog 
technology into a teaching plan.
Skype
Skype  and other similar V oIPs (V oice over Internet Protocol), 
a digital technology used for live verbal communication via 
the Internet, is popular in Indonesia. The student teachers 
in this study identified Skype’s potential for learning, espe -
cially as a tool to exercise students’ oral English proficiency 
(Erben et al., 2009). Categorized as synchronous technology, 
Skype needs an Internet connection to function. An ideal use 
of Skype for learning is an activity that happens in real-time 
(live) where being spontaneous is part of the learning pro -
cess, as with speaking skills. The student teachers felt Skype 
would work well as a tool for oral English proficiency prac -
tice with peers. Using a Skype-installed smartphone that 
connects to the Internet, students would be able to conve -
niently practice with partners. One student, a regular user of 
Skype and similar V oIPs, cited the popularity of Skype and 
its potential for learning when endorsing the practice: “ For 
teaching speaking skill, I suggest Skype and Google hang -
outs since these two are commonly used in Indonesia. When 
I was in high school my friend and I often used Skype and 
Google hangouts for video call. I think they are also sui table  
for teacher to use the tools both as training and assessing 
speaking skill .”
Skype is also commonly used for conferencing. The stu -
dent teachers preferred Skype technology for its ease of in -
stallation on personal technology devices like laptops and 
smartphones. In addition to its clear voice quality, they ar -
gued that Skype has features that enable them to have a con -
ference in a group (group conference).
WhatsApp
An instant messaging platform, WhatsApp’ s popularity is 
credited to its affordability, immediacy, flexibility of space 
(could contain a long text), and a sense of community 
(Church & Oliveira, 2013). These factors about WhatsApp 
were confirmed in the present study as student teachers 
explained how they planned to take advantage of using 
WhatsApp for teaching and learning purposes. First, they re -
ferred to a ‘group’ feature in WhatsApp that allows them to 
communicate and disseminate information to invited mem -
bers (typically created exclusively for a range of different 
interests). A  WhatsApp group makes it possible for members to distribute documents, video clips, photos, and links to oth -
er sites or information, and even to broadcast news to much 
wider audiences. The following quote is from a student 
teacher describing how she planned to infuse WhatsApp into 
a classroom activity.
	 A	teacher	asks	students	to	go	out	classroom	 to	find	a	
room similar to the description in the book or that have 
been discussed. Students will take a note what they will 
be	findings.	Working	in	a	group,	they	are	free	to	look	for	
a room with a sui table  description. During the search -
ing time, the teacher and students will be connected via 
WhatsApp in one of their digital devices (smartphone 
or Ipad). Using WhatsApp students will share what they 
have found (images and description). After the time is 
up and images being searched are collected, students 
will write a description about each one of the pictures.
The use of WhatsApp in the above activity is not only as 
an immediate communication tool during a dynamic group 
activity, but also as a detailed and transparent process during 
the time students are con figuring their understanding (learn -
ers’ community).
Student teachers enjoyed WhatsApp for its intimacy 
and for the communal experience. They maintained that 
they formed a sense of community when they were in a 
WhatsApp group. This sense of community and intimacy 
within WhatsApp differed from their Facebook group ex -
perience where they felt less privacy. However, the student 
teachers agreed that WhatsApp carries some limitations for 
learning—more so than other technologies like Facebook, 
for instance. In WhatsApp, users have to download videos 
within messages in order to watch them; this is not the case 
with Facebook where users can watch videos instantly from 
the Facebook page. Student teachers also found WhatsApp 
message threads somewhat overwhelming and hard to fol -
low. They were skeptical about using WhatsApp for class -
room discussion and considered a Facebook group to be 
more preferable and conducive for learning.
DISCUSSIONS
This research sought to explore Indonesian student teachers’ 
initial perceptions about digital technologies for teaching 
and learning. Our report focused on digital technologies that 
they selected to include in their teaching plans as well as 
their ideas for including them. When selecting those digital 
technologies, the student teachers referred to their personal 
experiences when explaining what made these technologies 
potential tools for teaching and learning. In other words, 
these digital technologies emerged organically among these 
research participants. For discussions, we will focus on con -
necting the findings with research about potential digital 
technologies that confirms our exploratory research findings. 
We intend to show that the potential of the student teacher 
selected digital technologies has also been found in other 
research contexts and approaches beyond the present study.
The student teachers’ inclusion of Facebook in their 
teaching plans reveals information that echoes the analysis 
advanced by Manca and Ranieri (2013), two Italian schol -
ars who conducted a meta-review analysis on the use of 58 IJELS 6(3):53-60
 Facebook for learning. We will use their review as a refer -
ence in discussing our Facebook findings. (a) Facilitating 
e-classrooms.  Our findings confirmed Manca and Ranieri’s 
review on studies about the way in which a Facebook group 
and some of its identifiable characteristics are useful as a 
learning space. The characteristics that they identified in -
clude being able to share learning resources, to leave com -
ments, to write on walls, and to initiate discussions. The fact 
that a Facebook group provided features such as these deems 
it a good space for learning. (b) Having interactive discus -
sion. To some extent, this finding echoes Manca and Ran -
ieri’s conclusion that a Facebook group’s use for learning 
is overwhelmingly for interactive discussions. Furthermore, 
they have an interesting finding that in having an interactive 
discussion in a Facebook group, students appear to bene -
fit from learning from each other (mutual learning), which 
makes them more aware of exercising critical thinking. (c) 
Providing a safe and less intimidating space . This confirms 
Manca and Ranieri’s research review which concludes that 
Facebook is one digital technology that is able to provide 
supports and facilities to learn as while on Facebook, stu -
dents tend to freely participate, discuss, and share informa -
tion. They also tend to be more open to discussion. Addition -
ally, in some cases, English language learners participated 
and interacted more online than in traditional classrooms 
where they tend to be passive due to language barriers and 
social pressures.
Our blog findings, especially when pertaining to the stu -
dent teachers’ suggestion that they had more sense of own -
ership, echo the research finding by Ducate and Lomicka 
(2008). Ducate and Lomicka’s research showed that a blog 
appears to be helpful skill practice for students who are 
learning to write in a foreign language. Their findings about 
the advantages of writing on a blog are especially evident in 
providing learners a strong sense of belonging and writing 
creativity (ownership and creativity). Ducate and Lomicka 
also point to other benefits of blogs for students; students 
appear to be comfor table  on their blog experimenting with 
language use, a crucial factor in mastering a new language. 
In short, writing on a blog gave students a space where they 
felt more relaxed in experimenting and exercising expres -
sions while learning a foreign language. At the same time, 
though, a blog is by default a public space (unless the set -
ting is changed to private). In this case, a foreign language 
learner who feels comfor table  writing on a blog is somewhat 
connected to teachers and classmates who are able to leave 
comments and offer suggestions. This finding is similar to 
the present study about including tags (hashtags) in a blog 
posting in order to connect with others who share interests.
The student teachers in the study noted Skype’s poten -
tial benefit for developing students’ verbal ability—as in this 
case, oral English proficiency. A  question whether Skype 
presents itself as beneficial for language learning was ex -
amined in an experimental research by Japanese researchers 
Kato, Spring, and Maori (2016) where they assigned con -
trol and experimental groups of students who learned for -
eign languages (English and Japanese). The researchers used 
Skype as a support to provide a meaningful experience in an authentic environment. In using Skype, both groups had na -
tive partners in respective language (American students with 
Japanese native partners and Japanese with American part -
ners) with whom they practiced using structures and activi -
ties developed by the researchers. Their findings showed sta -
tistically significant improvement of communication skills 
(listening and speaking skills) in both groups of language 
learning students. When they communicated, they tended to 
talk longer and were able to respond to the target language 
being spoken. Especially with American students studying 
Japanese, the improvement showed in their ability to speak 
with more varied vocabularies and longer sentences. In 
contrast, control students of both language groups who re -
ceived no Skype practices showed little improvement. Also, 
their qualitative findings explanation is quite convincing in 
affirming the benefits of using Skype as a medium for lan -
guage learning development.
This study’s student teachers appreciated WhatsApp’s 
ability to offer a sense of immediacy and intimacy in a learn -
ing activity. To some extent, WhatsApp serves as a window 
that gives us insights about the student teachers’ personal 
agency in the learning process as well as insights about their 
social interactions and collaborations with others (Dabbagh 
& Kitsantas, 2012). This is perhaps what British researchers 
O’Hara and colleagues (2014) called a process of ‘doings’ 
in WhatsApp where members build connections by shar -
ing brief notes and short narrations and sharing light mo -
ments by communicating thoughts, feelings, news, photos, 
videos, and links. O’Harra and colleagues contend that the 
use of WhatsApp for such activities fits the description of 
a ‘dwelling ’ place in which WhatsApp is a digital platform 
where people/members enjoy being involved in dynam -
ic discussions that cover a wide range of topics and inter -

CONCLUSIONS
Earlier we cited English teaching specialist Nicky Hockly 
(2013) who insisted that English teachers should incorporate 
digital literacy, competency in digital technologies use, into 
teaching. Our semester long data revealed insights pointing 
to a number of advantages as perceived by the Indonesian 
EFL student teachers. The student teachers in this research 
agreed that digital technologies like a Facebook closed group 
offer inviting environments for students to participate; stu -
dents feel safe to share thoughts in a Facebook closed group. 
Classrooms that integrate digital technologies have a good 
chance to foster students’ ownership in developing writing 
skill (blogs) and to develop spontaneous and authentic oral 
communication (Skype). Finally, student teachers felt that 
the ability of messaging platforms like WhatsApp to offer 
intimacy and immediacy provides the potential to nurture a 
dynamic community of learners where feelings of together -
ness and accessibility are expected. As the authors’ final note, 
the digital technologies mentioned above are categorized as 
synchronous—technology requiring users to be “online at the Digital Literacy With EFL Student Teachers: Exploring Indonesian Student  
Teachers’ Initial Perception About Integrating Digital Technologies Into a Teaching Unit 59
same time in order to communicate in real time” (Erben et al., 
2009, p. 84). This online connectivity requirement may be an 
issue for students in Indonesia who like the student teachers 
in this research would likely be dependent on the free wireless 
network available on a school/university campus. Otherwise, 
they would have to ration their use of limited Internet data 
from smartphones. We are suggesting this as a point of con -
sideration for teachers who are interested in exploring digital 
technology integration into their teaching. Finally, the present 
study limits its discussion on student teachers’ engagement 
with digital technologies for teaching. Therefore, we decided 
that concerns related to data privacy and online security were 
beyond the scope of the current discussion.

DigitalLiteracy,9038.txt,"Exploring the Power of Savings for Women
A safe, efficient, and reliable mobile savings platform to grow women’s businesses MINDFUL SAVING
Rose Kibona, a 59-year-old woman entrepreneur in Mbeya, Tanzania, has a stall in 
an open market where she sells soft drinks and prepared meals. She recently took a 
business training course administered by TechnoServe that included instruction on 
accessing M-Pawa, a new Vodafone mobile savings platform. She had been saving 
informally for years, relying on insecure containers like jars and bags. She planned 
to buy a car with the money saved in a large bag, and had a lockbox to save for 
emergencies. She exemplified the mindful saving behavior of many women micro and 
small entrepreneurs in developing countries, using mental discipline and making money 
less fungible by mentally allocating savings for a purpose. But M-Pawa gave her a safe, 
efficient, and reliable platform to grow her business and transform her livelihood.
Women face obstacles related to their 
gender that impair their economic performance
These obstacles include those that stem from 
women’s subordinate position in the family and 
lower decision making-power that affect busi-
ness investment decisions negatively; women’s traditional household and care responsibilities 
that impose time and travel restrictions; and tra-
ditional social norms that restrict women’s access to productive resources and services.  A database 
of more than 230 rigorous program evaluations, 
show that smart designs (including access to reli-able savings) that address these constraints head-
on can bring substantial benefits to women and 
be relatively simple to implement.  
Mobile savings hold great promise for 
empowering women entrepreneurs
Women are often disproportionately burdened 
by high transaction costs to access savings  
accounts. 
• More than 1 billion women lack access to ba-
sic financial services like bank accounts, loan 
services, and savings products. 
• Despite a half billion rise in the number of for -
mal bank accounts in 2014–2017, a stubborn 
7 point gender gap in access remains world-wide—and 9 points in developing countries.
“Smart design” has the potential to address gen-
der constraints and benefit women. 
• Access to savings accounts can change the 
economic equation for women in many parts 
of the world. 
• Women differ from one another, however, and very poor women need more than a sin-gle intervention to improve their incomes. When it comes to saving money, women are far ahead of their male counterparts. 
• Across different countries and populations, 
for every 100 women, 63 will want to open a basic savings account, compared with only 26 
men. 
• Data collected from all banks in Chile re-veal that women want savings accounts 
more than men do. Women held 101 sav-ings accounts for every 100 accounts held by 
men in 2002; by 2015 women held 139 (or 
around 11.4 million of 20 million accounts 
in 2015).
More women than men are interested in 
opening a savings account with minimal 
or no transaction costs across countries

New evidence from Indonesia and Tanzania explores the effectiveness of mobile savings
Knowing all this the Center for Global Development, with support from the ExxonMobil Foundation and in 
collaboration with research and implementing partners, further tested the power of mobile savings and business training. It launched two randomized controlled trials in 2015, in Indonesia and in Tanzania, to assess the power 
of mobile savings and training for women entrepreneurs.
Short-term results for Tanzania show that mobile savings increase savings and empower women—and quality 
business training bolsters savings and improves business practices
Results from Tanzania suggest that women’s access to 
the M-Pawa mobile savings platform had a significant impact on women’s savings and that adding business 
training enhanced the economic outcomes. 
• Both the amounts deposited and the amounts 
withdrawn increased significantly. 
• On average, women in the M-Pawa group saved three times more money weekly than women in 
the control group, while those in the M-Pawa plus business training group saved almost five times 
more.
• Business training significantly increased use of record keeping by 32% and financial planning by 
25%. • Relative to women in the control group, women who had access to M-Pawa and received business training were 4.6 percentage points more likely to 
operate a second business and, as a result, generat-
ed approximately $2 in additional monthly profits.
The mobile savings platform also had a positive sub-jective impact on women’s economic empowerment and well-being.
• The M-Pawa intervention significantly raised wom-
en’s satisfaction with their lives. 
• These women were 5.0 percentage points more likely to report being very happy and 4.8 percent-
age points more likely to report that their lives 
have improved.Indonesia—testing supply
Financial service providers received 
financial incentives to promote a new 
mobile savings product to women 
entrepreneurs. The women received training to increase uptake of mobile 
savings. Tanzania—testing demand
Women microentrepreneurs in two cities 
received access to an interest-bearing mobile savings platform, M-Pawa. Some 
women also received 12 weekly training 
sessions on business skills.
